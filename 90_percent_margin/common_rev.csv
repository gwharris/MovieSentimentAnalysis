2815_4.txt,  really liked this quirky movie. The characters are not the bland beautiful people that show up in so many movies and on TV. It has a realistic edge with a captivating story line. The main title sequence alone makes this movie fun to watch.,5,5255_7.txt," My sisters and my cousin forced me to see this chick movie. Its not the kind of movie  would prefer to see but it really wasn't that bad.  wouldn't want to see this movie but after watching it  couldn't say it was bad just not my kind of film. It was very accurate in acting out what woman really talk about and do in certain situations. As a guy  wasn't TOO amused by the jokes but man the women sure were. They related to the movie and yeah it was funny to see themselves on the big screen. ""OH EM GEE  DO THAT TO HAHA"" I've never seen the original nor would  care to. If you are a girl this is a must see but maybe girls would say this movie sucked probably.  don't see a  year old going ""Wow  remember going threw that when  was  No man would have this in there collection but  can't say it was horrible so meh.",5
3603_3.txt, Another direct to video movie from Disney that is essentially perfect for the kids. The problem with Kronk's New Groove  find is that everything that made the first movie a fun great ride is replaced with a more sad and sombre film. In this movie Kronk learns a great deal of lessons at many others expenses. It takes away much time that could be spent at creating a more enjoyable film. Kronk's New Groove deals with two stories Yzma returns for payback and one Ms. Birdwell hopes to defeat Kronk's camp counseling championship. This all leads up to Kronk confronting his father and his disapproval over his son's direction in life. From Lord of the Rings to Michael Jackson's Thriller Kronk's New Groove recycles every bit of time that it allows to entertain its viewers. If you loved the original or are looking forward to the upcoming TV series about Kuzco  recommend Kronk to his loyal fans.,5,3491_7.txt, No real plot no character development no Scorcese direction but seriously were you really expecting any of this? The only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious nearly on the same level as Borat. Sure the ending drags a bit but if Borat's cameo didn't crack you up you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys. Sacha Baron Cohen is possibly the greatest comedian ALIVE and here he gets more laughs than Jude Law on a nude beach.  dare you not to laugh. If you can pull the ten pole out of your behind for an hour and a half and just enjoy some well timed and extremely stupid jokes in a stupid story about a stupid character see this stupid movie. You'll be glad you did. Keep it real!,5
3486_1.txt, This film has the language the style and the attitude down  plus greats rides from Occy  world champ and the great Jerry Lopez. John Philbin as Turtle has the surf pidgin down and the surfing scenes are still the best ever.  true classic that can be seen many times. Nia Peeples is a babe and Laird Hamilton shows the early stuff that has made him the world's number one extreme surfer.,5,1618_10.txt," OK  am a sucker.  loved it.  had no expectations and had them all fulfilled. It was a terrible movie.  loved it.  have managed to wear out a DVD from over use. No one can understand my obsession.  can't either to tell the truth. For those who have seen the movie this will come as no surprise but  asked the clerk at the video store if  could buy a copy and  could because there were two in stock and only one had been check out and over half of the time it had been to me. Now the movie is terrible. The special effects are terrible. The acting is terrible but  loved it. The actors are silly the plot silly the goofs numerous being able to see through the monsters The ""arachnids"" looked like they were made out of plastic garbage bags  they were There was light underground TNT wasn't deafening etc. You must really love  to get any enjoyment out of this. helps enormously for others.",5
4201_1.txt, This is definitely one of the best Kung fu movies in the history of Cinema. The screenplay is really well done  is not often the case for this type of movies and you can see that Chuck  one of his first role a great actor. The final fight with the sherif deputy in the bullring is a masterpiece!,5,10944_7.txt, Well don't expect anything deep an meaningful. Most of the fight scenes are pretty decent. The two leading ladies are quite endearing but their lack of HK action background shows at times. The ending maybe lacks something but  quite enjoyed it none the less. The cheesy humour isn't probably going to appeal to anyone who hasn't watched a bunch of HK films but if your down with that sort of thing and have a couple of hours to fill with something meaningless you could do a lot worse than this.  so you could do better but. Certainly on a par with most of the Hollywood blockbuster action drivel. ,5
3794_4.txt,"  went to see this  nights ago here in Cork Ireland. It was the world premiere of it in the tiny cinema in the Triskel Arts Centre as part of the Cork Film Festival.  found ""Strange Fruit"" to be an excellent movie. It is a bit rough around the edges but for a low movie that is to be expected! In general the acting  from the main lead Kent Faulcon is wonderful the cinematography and direction excellent and the script hugely entertaining and thought with some nice set and witty dialogue. The ending was a bit sudden with no conclusion given to characters and events once the finale came to its gripping end  but perhaps that's what the filmmakers were going for? It certainly did make the movie more unsettling.  did like the fact that the main character never came to terms with his mother on screen it leaves you wondering whether or not he ever will as in real sometimes these things are never settled. This was a good choice to leave it unresolved rather than sentimentally wrapping it up! Taut and suspenseful throughout ""Strange Fruit"" is a hugely ambitious debut and  have high hopes for what the writer Kyle Schickner will unleash next. He  and his colleagues  are a talent worth watching.  hope ""Strange Fruit"" gets a wider release soon as more people deserve to see this movie an above thriller with some original and insightful twists on homophobia and racism in America's Deep South. Highly Recommended ",5,2795_7.txt,"  AHEAD It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to be such a disappointment.  thought this was full of  clich and that it basically tried to hard. To the  guys out there how many of you spend your time jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkey sounds? To the  girls how many of you have suddenly gone from prudes to nymphos overnight not with your husband? To the French would you really ask about someone being  la fac"" when you know they don't speak French? Wouldn't you use a more common word like ""universit  lived in France for a while and  sort of do know and understand Europe   love it but my  roommate and  found this pretty insulting overall. It looked like a movie funded by the European Parliament and it tried too hard basically. It had all sorts of differences that it tried to tie together  a bad thing in itself but the result is at best awkward but in fact ridiculous many clashes that wouldn't really happen. Then the end of the movie last  minutes all the rest. Why doesn't Xavier talk to the Erasmus students he meets back in Paris? Why does he just walk off? Why does he just run away from his job is that ""freedom"" And in the end is the new Europe supposed to rest on  bunch of people who smoke up and shag all day? Is this what it's made up of? Besides the acting was pretty horrible.  can't believe Judith Godr role and acting. Why was she made to look like Emanuelle  so much? At first  thought Xavier was OK but with retrospect  think he was pretty bad. And that's all really too bad because technically  credits scenes when he's asking what papers he needs it was really good  for sound editing around the British siblings and the soundtrack was great too. So the form was good but the content pretty horrible.",5
6170_4.txt, Mickey Rourke hunts Diane Lane in Elmore Leonard's Killshot It is not like Mickey Rourke ever really disappeared. He has had a steady string of appearances before he burst back on the scene. He was memorable in Domino Sin City Man on Fire Once Upon a Time in Mexico and Get Carter. But in his powerful dramatic performance in The Wrestler  we see a full blown presentation of the character only hinted at in Get Carter. Whenever we get to know him Rourke remains a cool but sleazy muscle bound slim ball. This is an Elmore Leonard story and production. Leonard wrote such notable movies as taunt western thriller  to Yuma Be Cool Jackie Brown Get Shorty  Pick and Joe Kidd. This means that we get tough guys some good some not so good. It also means we get tight realistic plots with characters doing what is best for them in each situation weaving complications into violent conclusions. Killshot is no different. Tough slim ball killer Rourke stalks unhappily married witness Lane. Think History of Violence meets No Country for Old Men. It is not as intense bloody or gory as those two but it is almost as good. If you like those two including David Croneberg's equally wonderful Eastern Promises you will like Killshot also. Director John Madden has not done a lot of movies. His last few were enjoyable if not successful Proof Captain Corelli's Mandolin and Shakespeare in Love. Diana Lane hasn't had a powerful movie role since she and Richard Gere gave incredible performances in Unfaithful. Lately she is charming and appealing in romantic stories such as Nights in Rodanthe Must Love Dogs and Under the Tuscan Sun. Here she is right on mark balancing her sexy appeal with reserved tension. This is a small part for Rosario Dawson. Yet Dawson does a good job with it. You see a lot more of Lane including an underwear scene to rival Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut. While you are in the crime drama section also pick up Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Gone Baby Gone and Before the Devil Knows Your Dead. The last has wonderful performances by Phillip Seymour Hoffman Ethan Hawke Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney. Killshot flopped at the box office. More is our luck. It is certainly worth a  dollar rental if you like this genre. ,5,2673_9.txt, When the movie first started  thought cheesy. The first ten minutes were really boring. After the slow beginning and some of the soap opera antics  started liking it. The plot was different than anything  had ever seen. Now was it a horror? Not really. It shouldn't have been classied as a horror or the producers should have put more money into the movie to make it scary. As it was the creatures where only there for a short time.  can only assume this was for money reason. The good side was that the movie was very entertaining. It held my interest  the start and did make me wonder about creatures from another dimension. It was obvious that this was a first time movie for the director but there were a couple of highlights. By the end  was hooked. Too bad Hollywood didn't put more money behind this.,4
11653_3.txt," Based on the comments made so far everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it.  think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a GREAT movie it has its interesting moments. For one thing it was filmed on location in Colorado  it Breckinridge or Telluride?  can't remember but it is in the credits The location is absolutely stunning and spectacular. It's beautiful even to me who lived in Colorado for several years. Next it has Disney's penchant for wonderful character actors. Harry Morgan has never been in better form than when he plays in a Disney movie. He is literally hysterical. Also remember the wonderful Mary Wickes? Although she has a ""bit part"" in this movie she is great as always. If you don't know who she is think of the animated Disney version of Hunchback from Notre Dame  was one of the gargoyles and she was also the most interesting nun in ""Sister Act"" as well as the best nun in ""The Trouble With Angels. She has always been a great character actress and most character actors never receive the recognition they deserve. In addition to character actors and all casts in the  Disney may have not had the ""greatest"" movies but if you really watch some of them from beginning to end you will NOTICE that every movie has some really funny or hysterical moment in it. The entire movie may not be funny but there is always a comic gem  least  or  in every single ""live movie Disney ever made. Whether it's Harry Morgan in one of his bellowing tones of voice or Tim Conway floundering around or Joe Flynn giving one of his priceless looks of horror it is all good. The whole film may not be good but there are ALWAYS hysterical moments in every Disney film from this period that  have ever seen. Disney in this time period always managed to make a person smile despite the dumbness of the film. Bsed on these comments  disagree with viewers who say every Disney movie in this time period is awful. That statement it not quite accurate. Rather it is easier for me to give credit to the funny moments and overlook the weaknesses in the plots. Some live Disney movies are true classics  Yeller Bedknobs and Broomsticks Mary Poppins but for those that aren't  am able to appreciate them for what they were  good clean family fun in a time when movies had become vulgar crude and offensive.",5,8134_7.txt," This was Laurel and Hardy's last silent film for Roach Studios. However since the public had a real thirst for ""talkies"" this same short was re by the team just a few years later with only a few small plot changes. LAUGHING GRAVY was essentially the same plot except that Stan and Ollie were trying to hide a cute puppy from their grouchy landlord a goat like in ANGORA LOVE. This whole goat angle is the worst part of the film. While you could understand the boys wanting to keep a cute little dog  all it is snowy outside why exactly they bring a goat home is just contrived and pointless. According to the plot the goat followed them home and so they got tired of shooing it away and kept it. Huh? This just doesn't make any sense it had been a giraffe or a cow would they have done the same thing? Apart from being an unconvincing plot the movie itself is pure Laurel and Hardy with a familiar plot and familiar roles for the comedians. This film features quite a few laughs but unfortunately isn't one of their better films to wrap up their silent careers. This aspect of their careers just seems to have ended with a whimper.",4
12130_1.txt, This movie was pure genius. John Waters is brilliant. It is hilarious and  am not sick of it even after seeing it about  times since  bought it a few months ago. The acting is great although Ricki Lake could have been better. And Johnny Depp is magnificent. He is such a beautiful man and a very talented actor. And seeing most of Johnny's movies this is probably my favorite.  give it  Rent it today!,5,11206_9.txt, When you're watching Distant you know you're not watching a French movie there's little sex and it's mostly elliptical and people don't talk that much here there are a few lines scattered here and there and a couple of important conversations just to let you make sense of what's going on. It doesn't look American either there aren't any car chases or shoot or violence unless you consider the killing of a mouse an act of blood or the daily tension of getting by a subdued catastrophe. At times the relatively long medium shots may remind you of  Asian cinema but just reminds you the director doesn't push things to the radical minimalism of some Taiwanese filmmakers but then again this is not a Taiwanese movie it's a Turkish movie.  don't know what that means  don't even know if that's supposed to mean something. The movie doesn't have a plot proper and yet those few lines those somewhat long shots and that often mitigated tension gradually build a sense of something happening a sense of  for lack of a better word that grows on you. By the end of the movie you may get the feeling you're going to miss those two cousins who have many things in common but are worlds apart.,4
887_2.txt, In all honesty  haven't seen this film for many years but the few times  have tend to make parts of it stick in my memory as anyone who has seen it will understand.  first saw it as a child at a YMCA Halloween party in the early Sixties and it scared the hell out of us kids in a fun way.  remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze.  can't risk giving away the ending except to say that it was surprising to say the least.  remember vaguely the entire audience of young boys letting out a big scared holler followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed. The ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny climaxes to a movie in film history and yet oddly moving in a way. You have to see it for yourself which is not easy these days.  don't know if it's available on home video or not but it would still make a great Halloween feature for both kids and adults.,4,4990_7.txt," ""Comanche Moon"" had everything going for it. For starters Simon Wincer's back a man who's name is synonymous with high TV westerns. Unfortunately the problems with ""Moon"" are something even the most talented director couldn't solve  poor script based on a lackluster novel. Forget historical accuracies  as any reader of the novels can tell you the biggest travesty in ""Moon"" is that it's not even consistent with information from the original ""Lonesome Dove"" masterpiece. So many wonderful rich moments in the miniseries and to an even greater degree the book are completely missing in ""Moon. Considering the fact that most viewers of ""Moon"" are probably coming with at least some sort of ""Dove"" background the lack of character and emotional backstory is downright painful. That said ""Moon"" is one instance where the adapted version could and should have been altered to make it more suitable for the screen. For example the novel ""Moon"" focuses largely on the Comanches themselves. To its credit the miniseries tries to service the Comanches but in the end it gives them just enough that the viewer just gets a sense they're missing out on some important part of the story. Similarly Val Kilmer's Scull loses out here too  the role should have either been expanded so Kilmer  Rachel Griffiths for that matter actually had something to do or the roles should have just been reduced to smaller supporting parts. Instead Kilmer gets top billing for a character that just leaves you scratching your head after his appearance in the completely bizarre final act. There's strange moments throughout the film that just make no sense to those who haven't read the book  killer parrot? what?  further there isn't a single scene that shows us that Call and McCrae are anything near the amazing Texas rangers they claim to be. Not a single one of their expeditions in Moon  ""Dead Man's Walk for that matter ends successfully and Call and McCrae just seem to blunder their way through one pointless mission after another. Frankly Larry McMurtry should never have been given the job of writing the script and only did so because of the praise surrounding that other cowboy movie Brokeback Mountain. McMurtry can write good novels  there's some dissension over the consistency of that statement but he's never exactly established himself as a scriptwriter. This production would have benefited from not only bringing back director Wincer but original screenwriter Bill Wittcliff to adapt the novel to screen. Witcliff doesn't exactly have a mountainload of material to his screen writing credit but no one can deny he did a fantastic job at whittling down the original ""Lonesome Dove. With all this said ""Comanche Moon"" is almost a brilliant production aided by a terrific cast that unfortunately just aren't given enough to do. Steve Zahn's portrayal of Gus McCrae  or rather his portrayal of Robert Duvall as Gus McCrae  is dead And while some have criticized Karl Urban as Woodrow Call saying his performance doesn't imitate the quiet stoic Woodrow of the original movie all  can say is blame McMurtry because McMurtry is the one who  both in the ""Moon"" novel and now the miniseries  turned Woodrow from socially inept awkward but natural leader into some emotionless character whose lines are just dull and whose character motivations are only clear if you've seen them portrayed far more adequately in the ""sequel"" Still it's the cast that sparkles in ""Moon to the degree that  left the miniseries with that same feeling of melancholy  felt watching the original ""Lonesome Dove""  this time because  realized it's probably the last time we'll see these characters appear on screen for a long long time to come  and quite honestly this cast could have done so well in a well full network TV series. All in all aside from wasted opportunities with the cast the biggest travesty is that the original Lonesome Dove novel contained so much rich backstory for the characters that would have been fascinating utterly fascinating to see translated on screen. Unfortunately all that has been tossed aside in favor of McMurtry's tedious inconsistent and ultimately irrelevant prequel.",4
240_4.txt," There must be an error. This movie belongs with ""Plan  and a lot others as a quite entertaining silly diversion.

5292_3.txt,  enjoyed the beautiful scenery in this movie the first time  saw it when  was   Dunderklumpen is kind of cute for kiddies in a corny way. It reminded me of HRPUFFINSTUFF on sat mornings Its Swedish backdrops make it easy on the eyes  Don't expect older kids to be interested as the live action is way behind the times and most older kids will get bored. is definitely an under  age set movie and a nice bit of memories for those of us who were little kids in ,4,5744_10.txt, Right here we go you have probably read in previous reviews on this film that it is awful badly acted avoid at all costs. Well  suppose in some ways this is true it is fair to say that you couldn't write a spoiler in this comment as there is no plot to spoil. However there is a fine line between plain awful and absolutely hilarious and believe me this film is the latter. The acting is so bad the plot so non existent and the ending so completely baffling it will have you laughing the whole way through. There are scenes in this film that take comedy to a new level. Do not expect an Oscar winner but believe me for the small price you will pay for this disaster it is worth every penny.,4
8192_4.txt, It's schmaltzy but then what else did you expect? The heroine is Cinderella's younger sister complete with wicked mother sister and brother the hero  you can call him that is an ineffectual putz and the rival love interests are full of melodramatic villainy. The cast settings and wardrobe were all very attractive and  thought the actors did a superb job considering how weak the material was. The movie was prettily filmed and boasted a soundtrack that was carefully crafted to cue the viewer about what emotions he should be experiencing throughout. Megon McDonough sang sweetly and provided the film with some of its best moments. If you love Danielle Steel you will love this film. If you love archetypal romance you will love this film.  did not.  was able to sit through it but it was close.,4,4341_7.txt, LOL. The mere fact that  start off my review with  says it all.  used to watch this movie all the time as a kid and even then  sensed the silliness of it all. The low budget horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then.  watched it again yesterday and just couldn't stop laughing. It's so bad it's actually good lol. Like another reviewer said it doesn't take itself seriously. There's no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so. The soundtrack is so funny  laugh every time  hear it. The  is just a laugh riot. It's an all out war zone in New York full of explosions and total chaos. ridiculous you can't help but chuckle at the sight of it. Other hilarious moments  The scene with Kersey and the cop running side by side like  cowboys against the whole Wild West was so cheesy it was funny.  killed me how the bad guys could be shooting at Kersey and he could even drop down on one knee taking ever  slow aim and not get hit LMAO. Of course with him it was one shot kill with his elephant handgun LOL.  Another hilarious scene was the end when he finally killed the leader of the gang. a ROCKET LAUNCHER lol. the whole side of the apartment building with it.  It's apparent that Kersey is all but used to losing loved ones. his new girlfriend is quickly disposed of after only a few dates. The acting is so bad that you can't blame anyone that could only think that Kersey is mad at the destruction of the car lol. runs down looks at the carnage and just walks away. Again so bad it's good.  out of  stars.,4
9071_3.txt," The cast of ""All That"" returns for good humor in the ""Good Burger"" a place similar to an old fashioned fast food restaurant. The comedy is terrific the fun is non and though clich is a passer for kid and family comedy.  movie for all ages this movie is meant to enjoy laugh and pretty much a lazy movie for a rainy day as that's what I'd save this movie for a rainy day. USA aired it today and since  know that the cast of ""All That"" is in it  thought that it might be a bit of a chuckle burner but in good fun as Keenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell  one of the best young duos of that time were terrific together the pieces came together and everything worked out and it made it into good family fun together with some lazy day work to get off the bad day.

11165_4.txt,  have recently found this film on one of my husband's VHS tapes  blank variety which he uses to record stuff from the telly The film looks as if it was last shown in the eighties and  don't remember having seen it since. It has not  my knowledge been released on DVD or VHS although  shall browse around for a copy. The film tells the story of three young people two girls one on the edge of puberty and the other much younger and a young boy who go to live with their mother's brother and his young mute Irish wife. His wife also has two brothers who live with them. The children's uncle is an unpleasant control freak who forces his young wife to wear a silver collar whilst she watches a marionette show put on by him and her brothers in his toyshop. The eldest girl and one of the Irishmen  younger develop a love for each other whilst they live in the same house. The girl helps her aunt out in the shop whilst her brother helps his uncle to make things in the workshop. There are a lot of very disturbing elements to the film. There is the uncle's treatment of his wife as some kind of dumb  possession  by the collar whilst the Irish indulge dancing drinking and somewhat forbidden love. Interestingly though  have seen far more explicit themes played out in other movies made in Hollywood today. Makes you wonder whether the British film industry and the BBC have some kind of hidden agenda going on. Still despite it not being a children's movie there are a lot of playful magic moments in it and the one Irishman does some beautiful paintings.,4,6202_7.txt,  enjoyed this series but felt that the whole thing was let down by the sound recording For whatever reason they've had to employ an awful lot of what's called ADR where the actors replace the original location sound with a re of it in a sound booth. The reasons for doing this are usually due to problems at the location or because somebody screwed up somewhere in the sound production chain. It wouldn't be so bad if the ADR was done well but at times it's just plain distracting. It's not just the ADR that's the problem  the sound mix just doesn't match up to the quality of performances and the pictures. I'd be curious to know what went wrong.,4
11478_3.txt,"  saw this movie when it first came to the theaters in  and though  knew it wasn't of award winning caliber. kinda liked it. It tales the tale of  former cub scouts reuniting to take on the one task they never got to finish as kids  which is to climb Mt. Whitehead. Of course now the cub scouts are all grown up and have developed their personalities in a variety of ways but none too differently than they were as children. Richard Lewis is still neurotic Richard Belzer is still a playboy Franklyn Ajaye is still sort of the Dear Abby of the group and Tim Thomerson is still the surfer dude of the group. Of course the top billed star is Louie Anderson a ""true believer"" in everything Cub Scout related. He still lives in the same house with his mother still goes over the Cub Scout manual daily is brave reverent and clean and is the one who reunites the others for one more grand adventure in Scouting. Compounding their task however is the Grunski brothers two bullies drummed out of the Cub Scouts by the above mentioned. By coincidence they run into their old den and decide to harass them a bit albeit harmlessly. Not so harmlessly is three escaped convicts who think Pack  is from the FBI and are intent on wiping them out. All in all the movie still has bits of charm. Observe Richard Lewis trying to get comfortable on a folding cot for example and you have a really funny bit going for you. Upon further review the entire film needed more of that type of observational humor. It doesn't hold up well after all these years but still remains a guilty pleasure.",3,6510_7.txt, Okay  think we're all agreed that Michael Jackson was the low point. And the special effects too. But please keep in mind that this was NOT a big film okay? Not every film gets as much of a budget as Harry Potter or Star Wars. However  thought it was pretty funny altogether.  Nothing that would in my opinion waste your time. Parodies are always fun to watch and just because it wasn't big budget doesn't mean it's bad.  think this was a good movie if weak at some points. Hope this comment helps. ,4

Children under the age of  or even better under the age of  will probably will enjoy it the best and possibly new fans who haven't seen any of the original series But as far as fans of the original series will find this series missing much of the charm the made the original series so great It took David Tennant to get me to Appreciate how Much better Christoper Eccellestion was as a Doctor in the  season.  would only recommend this series for people who haven't seen much of the original series people who are under  and EXTREMELY DIE HARD who fans everyone else will just get a laugh and mumble curse words about Russel  Davies screwed up one of our favorite TV shows.,3,5437_8.txt," Actually I'll admit I'm a political junkie so this resonated with me but the erratic nature of Ms. Green   know what they did to her but the ending was such a copout and totally inconsistent with the film itself. Why can't Barry  and crew just left us wondering what he was going to do? Let us debate it. Instead they have this ""oh I'm not worthy"" bullshit ending and it just shows that when the chips were down it's better to leave the table instead of doubling down. Stop the Disney ending and putting a bow on it. Life isn't easy they should have had the courage to give the main character some backbone. We had to listen to the rhetoric the entire movie. and then it turned sniveling and the stupid inane behavior by Ms. Green  the crap was out of her system just made for a ridiculous near end of the movie that was icing on the cake.",4
