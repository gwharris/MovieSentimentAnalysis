1376_8.txt,  was having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me and  couldn't put it down until the end. and  had forgotten about my horrid day. and the ending. by the way. where is the sequel! the budget is obviously extremely low. but  look what they did with it! it reminds me of a play. they are basically working with a tent a  pod a few guns uniforms camping gear and a  thing. that is it for props. Maybe this is even a good thing forcing the acting and writing to have to step up and take their rightful place in film as the centers of the work instead of as afterthoughts used to have an excuse to make CGI fights  The cgi is fine. It is not exactly  but imho it still works. why? because there isn't too much of it and what there is is not  over with an army of effects house people trying to cram everything they can into the shot. it prompts the imagination. it's some relatively simple stuff with decent composition  the heavy freighter shot. there is one long shot that must be at least ten seconds. tracks the entire length of the ship. it must be a record for sci fi battle sequence film making in the past  years to have an action sequence that lasts longer than  seconds and some relation to the story. it might look old or not  of the art but it doesn't look stupid and it doesn't take away from the story. The acting is good except the characters die too fast to get to know them. The captain was great but a few of his scenes could have used another take.  also got confused with his character losing his cool and stomping on a corpse  like to think captains are calm cool and in control. what was going on in that scene? did the other crew worry about him losing it at that moment? did he feel himself losing control? Now as for the plot. mostly it is good. why? Because it doesn't try to explain itself. It just happens. It's called  planet its a mystery get it? Nobody knows why there is a statue and they don't find out either. The mysterious cult? The weird scientist with the tattoo? What do you expect to find out in less than  minutes? This isn't War and Peace. And thank god it's not star wars either. No midichlorians no  minutes of expository boring dialog that has no purpose in the story. The characters are stranded and are only able to figure out a few basic things. it is not a star trek episode where they find out it's leonardo davinci or a child like space wanderer. It is mysterious and  liked that.  don't know why maybe  can identify with these guys more  since they don't know whats happening and  don't either. they don't talk a lot of space gibberish or have magic boxes telling them what is happening. In fact  would argue that one of the weakest moments is when the  turns on the crew and tries to  the reason for the planet the cult etc. This coincidentally has some of the weakest dialog imho in the whole movie and it interrupts the flow and some of the characters look unnatural in that scene. OK sometimes  felt it was a little too mysterious though. Like why did the guy get fried through his eyes with lightning? That was odd. Just weird. The  ending. again  would have liked to have known some of these characters better. And would it have been so hard to have a  second rescue scene at the end? This is not a serial show it was a film and we like closure in films even if they can have a sequel. Imagine Hamlet with no  of angels sing thee to thy rest Anyways. What can  say. This was well worth the dollar  payed at the  box machine at the supermarket. It was also imho a better piece of storytelling than starwars parts   or  Like  said it sucked me in wanting to know what was happening and  couldn't stop watching until the end.,  was having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me and  couldn't put it down until the end. and  had forgotten about my horrid day. and the ending. by the way. where is the sequel! the budget is obviously extremely low. but  look what they did with it! it reminds me of a play. they are basically working with a tent a  pod a few guns uniforms camping gear and a  thing. that is it for props.

2673_9.txt, When the movie first started  thought cheesy. The first ten minutes were really boring. After the slow beginning and some of the soap opera antics  started liking it. The plot was different than anything  had ever seen. Now was it a horror? Not really. It shouldn't have been classied as a horror or the producers should have put more money into the movie to make it scary. As it was the creatures where only there for a short time.  can only assume this was for money reason. The good side was that the movie was very entertaining. It held my interest  the start and did make me wonder about creatures from another dimension. It was obvious that this was a first time movie for the director but there were a couple of highlights. By the end  was hooked. Too bad Hollywood didn't put more money behind this., When the movie first started  thought cheesy. The first ten minutes were really boring.

8134_7.txt," This was Laurel and Hardy's last silent film for Roach Studios. However since the public had a real thirst for ""talkies"" this same short was re by the team just a few years later with only a few small plot changes. LAUGHING GRAVY was essentially the same plot except that Stan and Ollie were trying to hide a cute puppy from their grouchy landlord a goat like in ANGORA LOVE. This whole goat angle is the worst part of the film. While you could understand the boys wanting to keep a cute little dog  all it is snowy outside why exactly they bring a goat home is just contrived and pointless. According to the plot the goat followed them home and so they got tired of shooing it away and kept it. Huh? This just doesn't make any sense it had been a giraffe or a cow would they have done the same thing? Apart from being an unconvincing plot the movie itself is pure Laurel and Hardy with a familiar plot and familiar roles for the comedians. This film features quite a few laughs but unfortunately isn't one of their better films to wrap up their silent careers. This aspect of their careers just seems to have ended with a whimper."," This was Laurel and Hardy's last silent film for Roach Studios.

11206_9.txt, When you're watching Distant you know you're not watching a French movie there's little sex and it's mostly elliptical and people don't talk that much here there are a few lines scattered here and there and a couple of important conversations just to let you make sense of what's going on. It doesn't look American either there aren't any car chases or shoot or violence unless you consider the killing of a mouse an act of blood or the daily tension of getting by a subdued catastrophe. At times the relatively long medium shots may remind you of  Asian cinema but just reminds you the director doesn't push things to the radical minimalism of some Taiwanese filmmakers but then again this is not a Taiwanese movie it's a Turkish movie.  don't know what that means  don't even know if that's supposed to mean something. The movie doesn't have a plot proper and yet those few lines those somewhat long shots and that often mitigated tension gradually build a sense of something happening a sense of  for lack of a better word that grows on you. By the end of the movie you may get the feeling you're going to miss those two cousins who have many things in common but are worlds apart., When you're watching Distant you know you're not watching a French movie there's little sex and it's mostly elliptical and people don't talk that much here there are a few lines scattered here and there and a couple of important conversations just to let you make sense of what's going on.

9692_9.txt, First off  want to say most of the people who give this a poor review don't like this kind of comedy the movie is great if you have an open mind and aren't afraid to laugh at some stupid things. This movie is shot just like the TV show with a lot of short clips compiled into one long movie. Some of the scenes don't even have dialog someone will just come out and do something unexpected and it is funny! The only negative  had is  felt like  wasted money on my Popcorn and Icee there was no way  could eat or drink anything during this movie  was constantly laughing.  was honestly nervous of drinking some Icee and seeing something that caused me to laugh and shoot it everywhere. If you don't mind some male nudity and you enjoy Jackass the movie jackass the TV show and viva la bam then for YOUR SAKE go see this movie. And if you DON'T like the first movie or the TV show. Don't see it and if you do see it don't post a bad review about it. Hardcore christians who see this and bash it just doesn't seem right to me., First off  want to say most of the people who give this a poor review don't like this kind of comedy the movie is great if you have an open mind and aren't afraid to laugh at some stupid things.

4990_7.txt," ""Comanche Moon"" had everything going for it. For starters Simon Wincer's back a man who's name is synonymous with high TV westerns. Unfortunately the problems with ""Moon"" are something even the most talented director couldn't solve  poor script based on a lackluster novel. Forget historical accuracies  as any reader of the novels can tell you the biggest travesty in ""Moon"" is that it's not even consistent with information from the original ""Lonesome Dove"" masterpiece. So many wonderful rich moments in the miniseries and to an even greater degree the book are completely missing in ""Moon. Considering the fact that most viewers of ""Moon"" are probably coming with at least some sort of ""Dove"" background the lack of character and emotional backstory is downright painful. That said ""Moon"" is one instance where the adapted version could and should have been altered to make it more suitable for the screen. For example the novel ""Moon"" focuses largely on the Comanches themselves. To its credit the miniseries tries to service the Comanches but in the end it gives them just enough that the viewer just gets a sense they're missing out on some important part of the story. Similarly Val Kilmer's Scull loses out here too  the role should have either been expanded so Kilmer  Rachel Griffiths for that matter actually had something to do or the roles should have just been reduced to smaller supporting parts. Instead Kilmer gets top billing for a character that just leaves you scratching your head after his appearance in the completely bizarre final act. There's strange moments throughout the film that just make no sense to those who haven't read the book  killer parrot? what?  further there isn't a single scene that shows us that Call and McCrae are anything near the amazing Texas rangers they claim to be. Not a single one of their expeditions in Moon  ""Dead Man's Walk for that matter ends successfully and Call and McCrae just seem to blunder their way through one pointless mission after another. Frankly Larry McMurtry should never have been given the job of writing the script and only did so because of the praise surrounding that other cowboy movie Brokeback Mountain. McMurtry can write good novels  there's some dissension over the consistency of that statement but he's never exactly established himself as a scriptwriter. This production would have benefited from not only bringing back director Wincer but original screenwriter Bill Wittcliff to adapt the novel to screen. Witcliff doesn't exactly have a mountainload of material to his screen writing credit but no one can deny he did a fantastic job at whittling down the original ""Lonesome Dove. With all this said ""Comanche Moon"" is almost a brilliant production aided by a terrific cast that unfortunately just aren't given enough to do. Steve Zahn's portrayal of Gus McCrae  or rather his portrayal of Robert Duvall as Gus McCrae  is dead And while some have criticized Karl Urban as Woodrow Call saying his performance doesn't imitate the quiet stoic Woodrow of the original movie all  can say is blame McMurtry because McMurtry is the one who  both in the ""Moon"" novel and now the miniseries  turned Woodrow from socially inept awkward but natural leader into some emotionless character whose lines are just dull and whose character motivations are only clear if you've seen them portrayed far more adequately in the ""sequel"" Still it's the cast that sparkles in ""Moon to the degree that  left the miniseries with that same feeling of melancholy  felt watching the original ""Lonesome Dove""  this time because  realized it's probably the last time we'll see these characters appear on screen for a long long time to come  and quite honestly this cast could have done so well in a well full network TV series. All in all aside from wasted opportunities with the cast the biggest travesty is that the original Lonesome Dove novel contained so much rich backstory for the characters that would have been fascinating utterly fascinating to see translated on screen.

To the  guys out there how many of you spend your time jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkey sounds? To the  girls how many of you have suddenly gone from prudes to nymphos overnight not with your husband? To the French would you really ask about someone being  la fac"" when you know they don't speak French? Wouldn't you use a more common word like ""universit  lived in France for a while and  sort of do know and understand Europe   love it but my  roommate and  found this pretty insulting overall. It looked like a movie funded by the European Parliament and it tried too hard basically. It had all sorts of differences that it tried to tie together  a bad thing in itself but the result is at best awkward but in fact ridiculous many clashes that wouldn't really happen.

To the  guys out there how many of you spend your time jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkey sounds? To the  girls how many of you have suddenly gone from prudes to nymphos overnight not with your husband? To the French would you really ask about someone being  la fac"" when you know they don't speak French? Wouldn't you use a more common word like ""universit  lived in France for a while and  sort of do know and understand Europe   love it but my  roommate and  found this pretty insulting overall. It looked like a movie funded by the European Parliament and it tried too hard basically. It had all sorts of differences that it tried to tie together  a bad thing in itself but the result is at best awkward but in fact ridiculous many clashes that wouldn't really happen.

4341_7.txt, LOL. The mere fact that  start off my review with  says it all.  used to watch this movie all the time as a kid and even then  sensed the silliness of it all. The low budget horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then.  watched it again yesterday and just couldn't stop laughing. It's so bad it's actually good lol. Like another reviewer said it doesn't take itself seriously. There's no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so. The soundtrack is so funny  laugh every time  hear it. The  is just a laugh riot. It's an all out war zone in New York full of explosions and total chaos. ridiculous you can't help but chuckle at the sight of it. Other hilarious moments  The scene with Kersey and the cop running side by side like  cowboys against the whole Wild West was so cheesy it was funny.  killed me how the bad guys could be shooting at Kersey and he could even drop down on one knee taking ever  slow aim and not get hit LMAO. Of course with him it was one shot kill with his elephant handgun LOL.  Another hilarious scene was the end when he finally killed the leader of the gang. a ROCKET LAUNCHER lol. the whole side of the apartment building with it.  It's apparent that Kersey is all but used to losing loved ones. his new girlfriend is quickly disposed of after only a few dates. The acting is so bad that you can't blame anyone that could only think that Kersey is mad at the destruction of the car lol. runs down looks at the carnage and just walks away.

11478_3.txt,"  saw this movie when it first came to the theaters in  and though  knew it wasn't of award winning caliber. kinda liked it. It tales the tale of  former cub scouts reuniting to take on the one task they never got to finish as kids  which is to climb Mt. Whitehead. Of course now the cub scouts are all grown up and have developed their personalities in a variety of ways but none too differently than they were as children. Richard Lewis is still neurotic Richard Belzer is still a playboy Franklyn Ajaye is still sort of the Dear Abby of the group and Tim Thomerson is still the surfer dude of the group. Of course the top billed star is Louie Anderson a ""true believer"" in everything Cub Scout related. He still lives in the same house with his mother still goes over the Cub Scout manual daily is brave reverent and clean and is the one who reunites the others for one more grand adventure in Scouting. Compounding their task however is the Grunski brothers two bullies drummed out of the Cub Scouts by the above mentioned. By coincidence they run into their old den and decide to harass them a bit albeit harmlessly. Not so harmlessly is three escaped convicts who think Pack  is from the FBI and are intent on wiping them out. All in all the movie still has bits of charm. Observe Richard Lewis trying to get comfortable on a folding cot for example and you have a really funny bit going for you. Upon further review the entire film needed more of that type of observational humor. It doesn't hold up well after all these years but still remains a guilty pleasure.","  saw this movie when it first came to the theaters in  and though  knew it wasn't of award winning caliber. kinda liked it.

It was the world premiere of it in the tiny cinema in the Triskel Arts Centre as part of the Cork Film Festival.  found ""Strange Fruit"" to be an excellent movie. It is a bit rough around the edges but for a low movie that is to be expected! In general the acting  from the main lead Kent Faulcon is wonderful the cinematography and direction excellent and the script hugely entertaining and thought with some nice set and witty dialogue. The ending was a bit sudden with no conclusion given to characters and events once the finale came to its gripping end  but perhaps that's what the filmmakers were going for? It certainly did make the movie more unsettling.  did like the fact that the main character never came to terms with his mother on screen it leaves you wondering whether or not he ever will as in real sometimes these things are never settled. This was a good choice to leave it unresolved rather than sentimentally wrapping it up! Taut and suspenseful throughout ""Strange Fruit"" is a hugely ambitious debut and  have high hopes for what the writer Kyle Schickner will unleash next. He  and his colleagues  are a talent worth watching.  hope ""Strange Fruit"" gets a wider release soon as more people deserve to see this movie an above thriller with some original and insightful twists on homophobia and racism in America's Deep South.

6170_4.txt, Mickey Rourke hunts Diane Lane in Elmore Leonard's Killshot It is not like Mickey Rourke ever really disappeared. He has had a steady string of appearances before he burst back on the scene. He was memorable in Domino Sin City Man on Fire Once Upon a Time in Mexico and Get Carter. But in his powerful dramatic performance in The Wrestler  we see a full blown presentation of the character only hinted at in Get Carter. Whenever we get to know him Rourke remains a cool but sleazy muscle bound slim ball. This is an Elmore Leonard story and production. Leonard wrote such notable movies as taunt western thriller  to Yuma Be Cool Jackie Brown Get Shorty  Pick and Joe Kidd. This means that we get tough guys some good some not so good. It also means we get tight realistic plots with characters doing what is best for them in each situation weaving complications into violent conclusions. Killshot is no different. Tough slim ball killer Rourke stalks unhappily married witness Lane. Think History of Violence meets No Country for Old Men. It is not as intense bloody or gory as those two but it is almost as good. If you like those two including David Croneberg's equally wonderful Eastern Promises you will like Killshot also. Director John Madden has not done a lot of movies. His last few were enjoyable if not successful Proof Captain Corelli's Mandolin and Shakespeare in Love. Diana Lane hasn't had a powerful movie role since she and Richard Gere gave incredible performances in Unfaithful. Lately she is charming and appealing in romantic stories such as Nights in Rodanthe Must Love Dogs and Under the Tuscan Sun. Here she is right on mark balancing her sexy appeal with reserved tension. This is a small part for Rosario Dawson. Yet Dawson does a good job with it. You see a lot more of Lane including an underwear scene to rival Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut. While you are in the crime drama section also pick up Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Gone Baby Gone and Before the Devil Knows Your Dead. The last has wonderful performances by Phillip Seymour Hoffman Ethan Hawke Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney. Killshot flopped at the box office. More is our luck. It is certainly worth a  dollar rental if you like this genre. , Mickey Rourke hunts Diane Lane in Elmore Leonard's Killshot It is not like Mickey Rourke ever really disappeared.

11653_3.txt," Based on the comments made so far everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it.  think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a GREAT movie it has its interesting moments. For one thing it was filmed on location in Colorado  it Breckinridge or Telluride?  can't remember but it is in the credits The location is absolutely stunning and spectacular. It's beautiful even to me who lived in Colorado for several years. Next it has Disney's penchant for wonderful character actors. Harry Morgan has never been in better form than when he plays in a Disney movie. He is literally hysterical. Also remember the wonderful Mary Wickes? Although she has a ""bit part"" in this movie she is great as always. If you don't know who she is think of the animated Disney version of Hunchback from Notre Dame  was one of the gargoyles and she was also the most interesting nun in ""Sister Act"" as well as the best nun in ""The Trouble With Angels. She has always been a great character actress and most character actors never receive the recognition they deserve. In addition to character actors and all casts in the  Disney may have not had the ""greatest"" movies but if you really watch some of them from beginning to end you will NOTICE that every movie has some really funny or hysterical moment in it. The entire movie may not be funny but there is always a comic gem  least  or  in every single ""live movie Disney ever made. Whether it's Harry Morgan in one of his bellowing tones of voice or Tim Conway floundering around or Joe Flynn giving one of his priceless looks of horror it is all good. The whole film may not be good but there are ALWAYS hysterical moments in every Disney film from this period that  have ever seen. Disney in this time period always managed to make a person smile despite the dumbness of the film. Bsed on these comments  disagree with viewers who say every Disney movie in this time period is awful. That statement it not quite accurate.

Some live Disney movies are true classics  Yeller Bedknobs and Broomsticks Mary Poppins but for those that aren't  am able to appreciate them for what they were  good clean family fun in a time when movies had become vulgar crude and offensive."," Based on the comments made so far everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it.  think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a GREAT movie it has its interesting moments.

11165_4.txt,  have recently found this film on one of my husband's VHS tapes  blank variety which he uses to record stuff from the telly The film looks as if it was last shown in the eighties and  don't remember having seen it since. It has not  my knowledge been released on DVD or VHS although  shall browse around for a copy. The film tells the story of three young people two girls one on the edge of puberty and the other much younger and a young boy who go to live with their mother's brother and his young mute Irish wife. His wife also has two brothers who live with them. The children's uncle is an unpleasant control freak who forces his young wife to wear a silver collar whilst she watches a marionette show put on by him and her brothers in his toyshop. The eldest girl and one of the Irishmen  younger develop a love for each other whilst they live in the same house. The girl helps her aunt out in the shop whilst her brother helps his uncle to make things in the workshop. There are a lot of very disturbing elements to the film. There is the uncle's treatment of his wife as some kind of dumb  possession  by the collar whilst the Irish indulge dancing drinking and somewhat forbidden love. Interestingly though  have seen far more explicit themes played out in other movies made in Hollywood today. Makes you wonder whether the British film industry and the BBC have some kind of hidden agenda going on. Still despite it not being a children's movie there are a lot of playful magic moments in it and the one Irishman does some beautiful paintings.,  have recently found this film on one of my husband's VHS tapes  blank variety which he uses to record stuff from the telly The film looks as if it was last shown in the eighties and  don't remember having seen it since.

12130_1.txt, This movie was pure genius. John Waters is brilliant. It is hilarious and  am not sick of it even after seeing it about  times since  bought it a few months ago. The acting is great although Ricki Lake could have been better. And Johnny Depp is magnificent. He is such a beautiful man and a very talented actor. And seeing most of Johnny's movies this is probably my favorite.  give it  Rent it today!, This movie was pure genius. John Waters is brilliant.
