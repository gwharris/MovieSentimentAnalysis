At least RS had the right idea by killing him. Now for all of you who thought Sam Lee  was a bad actor. wasn't meant to be taken seriously!  have just had the pleasure of watching Gen Cops  and Sam Lee played the same character the same way!

The film Haggard The Movie also has a lot of the characters from Jackass etc but to say it was written by Bam Margera and Co. this is a very weak attempt seems to me like it was written when he was bored or as a project with they did not pay a lot of attention to. The films also stars Bam's girlfriend Jennifer Rivell who plays Glauren Ryan's girlfriend who basically cheated on him again very bad acting by Jennifer another actor that some people may be interested in is Steve  Hellboy played by RakeYohn which his character does not seem to be with the story again bad acting also this character does not really have a lot of lines in this film which basically makes it very boring. but worst of all is Raab's character the voice sound like a smoker who basically has throat cancer also  think he could have been improved! Overall  think the characters in this film aren't with the story like in one scene it would be on one certain character a minute later a different scene different character. To say that this is supposed to be a film sort of a documentary its not played by the characters as a documentary the acting makes you think that its a cheap attempt at making a film with your spare time. Towards the middle of the film we start to lose focus on the main character Ryan Dunn although a lot of the attention is on Bam and Brandon. In conclusion this film is OK if you laugh at things that aren't very funny stupid stunts terrible acting and the occasional nude scene! Also  think there there are too many scenes of just no talking and just music! ,1,0

Afterwards  didn't even want to see any films for a long time any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison. For many it may be the worst of Antonioni very slow without an engaging conventional story line microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions and the worst of Wenders verbose confused transcendentalism. It is composed of short distinct episodes linked by Wenders typical meandering hero's stream of consciousness so it doesn't produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema. But for fans the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching a single poetic image that stretches across the film.

The husband contacts an UFO professor and with his help they try to find out what is wrong with her.  Spoilers! The story could have been a bit better or at least be made less predictable but the movie is catchy and it got me and my sister hooked through the entire movie without a problem. The acting is very good and the filming is much better than normal if you compare this to your normal  movie. The effects are good and something is happening every second of the movie.

Rudy Ray Moore's rhymin kung fu pimp with horrible choreographed action sequences is about as close as you can get to becoming a spoof of a genre without actually being spoof. Citizen Kane this may not be nor Les Infant Au Revoir but this is undoubtedly genius in it's own right. The production values in this movie are so bad they could qualify as existential special effects. The plot drags a little in the middle but the power of such a cheap premise as kung fu hookers is enough to bring all but the snootiest film lovers through. The infamous ever present boom mike evokes shades of the gloriously incompetent Ed Wood and never grows unfunny.  sometimes wonder if the boom mike was left in on purpose as commentary on the ridiculous aspects of movies in general but  usually get distracted by erotic scenes that lack eroticism to the point of high art mundanacity.

Second the changes from book to film. although when  was following the development of the film  complained about the change of some characters and the complete removal of others  gotta admit  was wrong. it was refreshing that the film didn't follow the book in exactly the same way like it was done in Da Vinci. if you are a purist of the book some of them may upset you though. However the BIG TWIST is still there so don't worry about that. finally i'm glad they removed some silly sub and didn't even try to hint at the possibility of Langdon and Vittoria getting together.

The sheer volume of complaints that the general public made towards the Brass Eye Special was unbelievable! Many complaints were voiced by people who never even watched the program! The subject that the program handled turned many heads but the message was widely misinterpreted. The message was even lost on some who enjoyed the program. This was not a show that mocked the subject of paedophilia. The show was purely about the media and it's presentation of the subject. Morris is and always will be a media satirist. The notion that the program  fun of paedophiles and children who have been abused is completely laughable! Morris never attempts to do either such thing. He merely draws our attention to the overwhelming and very often stupid media hype surrounding the subject. Using many of his established  Eye characters such as Ted Maul and others Morris shows just how much the media over blow every little thing about a subject that they themselves created and built up and the result is as funny if not funnier than anything Morris has done previously. Using his tried and tested formula Morris manages to trick several gullible celebrities into believing that they are working on a serious documentary. In actuality they are made to look like exactly what they are. Retards. All in all the Brass Eye Special needs to be seen to be believed. And with one opening line Morris manages to sum up the entire media situation as it stood in  ""Welcome to Paedo",1,0

First of all there's the music. It's just plain awful. There are only  songs in the movie most of them used more than once. The opening song is shrieked by a chorus of annoying children and the disco title track is performed by Rick Dees. It doesn't get any worse than that. Even the background music is terrible with much of it repeating the themes of the other nauseating tunes. We also get some truly lame slapstick mostly in the opening credits. On the other hand Bill Murray is spot on brilliant as usual. have to wonder if he ad the whole thing or if the writers just gave him all the funny lines. Or maybe he's just that great turning a weak script into comic genius. The best part are his surreal PA announcements.  out of here. a menace! You also get a lot more character development than you have any right to expect in a movie like this. At least half the characters seem like real people. mostly real people you would like to have around. Even ""Spaz"" gets to do a more than any other Eddie Deezen character ever did and when he gets the girl it's plausible.  not absurdly hot but he doesn't automatically pair up with one of the nerd girls see ""Revenge Of The Nerds"" for examples of both cinematic phenomenons. And when the plot seems clich ya gotta wonder if it wasn't a clich yet when they made this. While it wasn't the first summer camp movie ya gotta go back at least to ""The Parent Trap"" it's certainly the movie that made it it's own genre. In fact  was surprised that there was no Talent Show scene.

The grotesque visions hallucinations  dreams continue  begin to affect his mental state Fulci decides to seek help  contacts Professor Egon Schwarz   Thompson for psychiatric help. Schwarz claims that Fulci cannot separate fantasy from reality  agrees to help him however Schwarz has a more sinister ulterior motive as a serial killer starts to brutally kill prostitutes  Fulci thinks he might be responsible. This Italian production was co  directed by Lucio Fulci who also stars in the film as a horror film director named Lucio Fulci which doesn't really feel like a lot of effort went into it anyway Un Gatto nel Cervello is gory if nothing else  for that alone  rather liked it. The script by Fulci John Fitzsimmons Giovanni Simonelli  Antonio Tentori is nothing more than a threadbare excuse to edit together lots of gory footage from other Italian films. It serves it's purpose well enough  suppose  to see Fulci on screen has a certain fascination if your a fan of his or are familiar with his films the ending is very rushed almost as if they ran out of money as it just has a policeman telling Fulci they killed the killer  that's it. Another thing about that ending when the two cops put the white sheet over the dead killer in the field  then they walk away leaving it there without any other police presence  mean would the police in Italy just leave a dead body in the middle of a field on it's own? It moves along at a good pace  if you like your gore then you have to see this although if you don't like gore then you'll hate it with a passion it all depends on your disposition so the choice folks is yours. Director Fulci was never the most artistically adept filmmaker  it shows here as his footage is bland flat  looks like it was shot for TV the footage from the other films  in total doesn't match the stuff Fulci shot  it is obvious that this has been pieced together from different films. If your looking for gore you've hit the jackpot people are dismembered with chainsaws put through meat grinders faces are melted there are a few decapitations there are some slit throats someones body is gorily crushed under a car a tongue is ripped out someone has their throat crushed as a wheelchair runs over it there are loads of stabbings someone has their guts removed with a hook there's a rotten corpse complete with maggots someone hand is cut off someone has their head bashed in  their eye falls out a gory death by piano wire as it slices through someones throat there are loads of severed limbs gallons of blood splashed around  a scene of some cats eating brains  there's more as well. Having said that some of the special effects are a bit fake  look cheesy. With a supposed budget of around  it shows this is pretty cheap looking it has no visual style or artistic merit but then again why would you want those when you can see a Nazi orgy sequence  wall gore? The acting in this is terrible including Fulci. Un Gatto nel Cervello is a top film if your a gore like me however if your looking for something with a little bit more substance or indeed any substance then this ones not for you. This is the sort of film which divides people straight down the middle you'll either love what it does or hate it.,1,0

The cinematography is stunning. Each shot has a lyricism that one would expect in a film that has Wim Wenders's name attached to it. It is always tempting to see de Chirico in any picture of rows of orders vanishing into the gloom but in this case the analogy fits. In many ways the figure of Malkovich walking through the fog and wind of Ferarra echoes the shadow of the off statue that haunts Milan in the major works of the Italo painter. He is slightly menacing a presence who watches and in his capacity as a film director exerts influence on the entire story. The dedicated Wenders fan cannot help but think a little bit of Damiel and Cassiel wandering through the streets of Berlin watching all but not directly interacting with the inhabitants. And following the Himmel Uber Berlin metaphor the angel  in this case Malkovich the Director gets to interact with one of the stories. At this point  have to bow out of taking this line of criticism too far.  need to see the movie again.  am fairly sure that this is the thread that will bring Malkovich's monologue together. Perhaps his musings and pontifications are pretentious empty dialog that sound good but cannot possibly be parsed into real communication. Maybe that is the whole point of it. No one can make that judgment with any degree of certainty or authority until having done his homework. We must be careful when throwing around the word ""pretentious. It is easy to write off anything that smacks of the intellect as pretension but that leads to a terrifying mental state one in which the only conversation seen as genuine earthy or authentic is the most banal. When we shun all discussions of philosophy God existence meaning and all that brain candy we are setting our culture up to die a slow stupid and ugly death. Perhaps this is the warning that Wenders and Antonioni are giving us. It certainly is not the only theme of the film but  think that it cannot be ignored. The other  most obvious leitmotif is that of satisfaction. There is a lot here on that and a thorough review of all the subtleties and consequences of the development of this leitmotif would well exceed the  word limit for this review. My advice is to see the film. But  offer a caveat it is not an autonomous film  least  don't think so yet Some films interact with the intellectual and artistic thinking of their times so much that the viewer needs to have a background in the Zeitgeist before approaching the film.

For that  give it a  out of  point vote. It's a decent movie to show a youth group but  don't think it will be very well received beyond that. For any other audience I'd rate it lots lower. The reviewers that saw ""It's a Wonderful Life"" in this were right on though  didn't think of that until they mentioned it.  was more reminded of a ""Chick Tract"" those little  by  gospel comic books. If Jack Chick ever made a movie out of one of his tracts it would probably look a lot like ""Second Glance. It has a strong Christian message about the power of prayer and the influence each of us has on earth but it is somewhat hampered by Christian stereotypes. The Christians are all very nice somewhat passive and squeaky clean while all of the non seem to be bad people. Muriel the angel plays a major part and he is the corniest cheesiest character in the film. He is the most unlikeable angel  have ever seen in any movie and the biggest negative.  don't know if the directors intended for his personality to come off so badly or if he just struck me that way.  admit that he reminded me of someone  know. Dan's love for a very worldly girl who is not at all his type drives the plot in this movie. Why he ever fell for her in the first place is the one question that  wish had been answered.

The dog's ""best friend"" an American girl named Charlotte  by Courtnee Draper whose parents die becomes orphaned by the former Duke due to him being her great uncle.  young chef named Florian arrives with him and Charlotte instantly connecting creating a romantic sub which in its own way acts as the under tone for the main plot line being the activities of Hubert The  and his many activities and love interests with other dogs. All this is watched over by James Doohan who plays a Butler who is determined to try and serve his old Duke by doing his best to serve his new master Hubert. Doohan acts as the older character there to comfort and advise the younger ones whilst he over looks and performs various ridiculous tasks under his new master.  fine comedic performance mixed with elements of drama to end the career of a fine and influential actor. Though from the technical viewpoint  dislike this film as  only watched upon discovering James Doohan's role. Though the plot is good elements of the writing and directing have to be obscured. Ignoring the absurdity of a ""Doggie Duke""  personally dislike the over use of comedic and outrageous jokes upon the  characters due to their ludicrousness. The dependence on hygiene related humour as you like is much too apparent and general silliness of many characters doesn't appeal to me. The director Phillip Spink uses mid shots too often with either an overdubbed voice or affecting the overall sound quality. Plus the acting of Muirhead and Heyman whilst good at the dramatic and romantic sequences fall drastically short fulfilling the wholesale requirements regarding the role. But as a mature movie fan  find it easy to be over critical of a simple family film designed to make you laugh.  can admit  found certain bits funny and other bits touching along with a plot that may be far but has definite connections.  do not recommend this film to mature movie fans but  do highly recommend it to Dog lovers families who wish to enjoy a funny film for their child and James Doohan fans who wish to see  in his final role.",0,1

The only way you'd have any understanding of most of what occurred in the film would have been if you had played the game. We barely got to see them before they were battling it out with whatever current threat. What hurts the fans even more is the awful cameos that the majority of FF characters were given. They were nothing more than Cloud's ""I'll call if  need you but  probably won't"" back up singers. And to add to the hurt they had each character individually throw Cloud higher and higher. This little part here was so cheesy  almost turned it off.  would have been much more impressed if he had just simply jumped up all on his own ricocheting off of walls to get himself up higher. It hurt even more when they reduced the Turks to less comic relief. That was fine for the game but this is cinema. People do not act like cartoon characters in a harsh battle.

11395_4.txt,""" nice great glamorous handsome serious s scandalous good good original handsome great unhappy many good unrequited elegant last empty sad dissipated more Sure human able emotional didn give"""," After watching this film  thought to myself they really glossed up Errol Flynn's life! The movie is really nice eye candy. They really got the  and  atmosphere of Hollywood just right. The costumes were great. All the women looked glamorous and all the men looked handsome and debonair. Is this a serious film about Errol Flynn's life? Nah! It's a fun movie based on all the scandalous stuff he did in his life. Why am  critiquing this film? This is a film that had a lot of promise but failed to deliver. Duncan Reagher was really good as Errol Flynn. He was not as good looking as the original but he made you believe that Flynn was not just a handsome playboy who did not take himself seriously but as a man who although gifted with great talent was kind of disturbed and unhappy inside. Flynn's love life was a disaster considering he had so many failed marriages. He also lost a lot of good friends during his life. He also suffered from unrequited love for the elegant Olivia DeHavilland. The last scene of the film showed Errol kind of begging for Olivia to stay with him and instead she walks away. He is shown in his tux looking really empty and slowly walking around the pool as he pours his drink into the pool. It was a sad way to end the film but kind of fitting because everyone knows by now how he eventually fell apart from his alcoholism and his dissipated lifestyle. This film could've had much more depth could've been better well Sure they showed all the scandals but they never showed Errol Flynn's human center. Surprisingly Duncan Reagher was able to put some emotional depth into the character of Errol Flynn even though the film writing didn't put any depth there. I'll probably never see this film again but  can still remember after viewing this film ""Gosh this could've been so much more.  give this film a ",0,1

The only good reading of the character I've heard was done for radio by Amanda Root who gave it the same quality as she did the character Anne in the film of ""Persuasion"" a stern sure heartfelt moral centeredness. If the actress had been younger she would have been good visual casting as well but the Fannys that have reached our eyes to date have more resembled respectively Mary Crawford Ruby the scullery girl and  this incarnation a jovial serving wench or possibly tart with her high moral principles pulled down a peg. Well  had hoped for better but had feared worse. The serial had a solid Edmund in an actor who was best at likable saps and the perfect  perfectly abominable Mrs. Norris otherwise it was dullish. The film which was apparently intended as a deconstruction or some other bad theatrical idea came off as a mixed burlesque. After such disappointments and the more recent disappointments of this production's sister pieces  new ""Persuasion"" and ""Northanger Abbey""  couldn't help but have mixed expectations for this one and on the whole it left me feeling slightly better disposed to it than not. It condensed the novel intelligently and in the end left me with much the same feeling as a comic version might. On the other hand to do so it had to rework most of the characters except the Crawfords and it incidentally diminished or eliminated most or all of the most memorable things in the book including its most famous character and what should be if it isn't its most famous scene. The character is the officious Aunt Norris always ready to direct other people in what to do but always managing to avoid having to do any of it herself here one gets no sense of that at all. And with her goes much else her remark that cuts through Fanny  who and what you are"" Sir Thomas's discovery that she has forbidden Fanny a fire in her room all these years and his roundabout apology for her Fanny's honesty in acknowledging during a visit home that Aunt Norris for all her faults could manage the household better than either of her sisters. But then that entire trip is missing from the story and so is most of what goes on at the theatrical rehearsals and most of what discomfits Sir Thomas on his return and in fact Sir Thomas himself and his wife are different from what they were. Above all the scene in which Crawford proposes to Fanny one of Austen's most complex is simplified to a bare telling missing from it is Fanny's staunch upholding of what she knows to be right and what she knows to be very probably true against all the distractions Crawford and anybody else can throw at her. To a male reader now no less than when it was written it reveals with unmatched clarity at any rate as far as  know a woman goes through in trying to deal fairly but firmly with a man she has reason to distrust. It's a brilliant scene in the novel on TV it's just a scene. And Fanny oh Fanny when will we see your like?",0,1

One can argue whether this is true or not. But even if you accept this as true the movie's ending either  disputes this by saying there can be some good in tragic situations or  forgets this and uses a cliched montage in order to leave the audience feeling uplifted. That the movie metaphorically acquits its protagonist by presenting him as a sympathetic character despite any evidence for that sympathy shows contempt for the supporting characters who were the most compelling in the film. So what you have in this film is a script that is not consistent in its theme and direction that does not bring the ending into sync with the rest of the film. There are excellent performances given by every member of the cast especially Spacey Olin Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson. It's a shame that they weren't supported by a better writer,0,1

Jaime Pressly's got stunning looks but if she thinks stretching lips to explore parts of the face to which they normally never go to and making strange grimaces to accentuate everything she says is hilarious she's way off track.

Some of us won't be fooled. Some of us also are not quite prepared to accept Jamie Foxx's performance as anything more than superb mimicry. Granted Foxx eerily resembles Ray Charles he walks like Charles talks like Charles and even twitches like Charles. Foxx's imitation of the singer during live performance is technically perfect. I'm not begrudging Mr. Foxx his Oscar he deserved it.  was a pretty weak field this year anyway. But one wonders if Foxx really UNDERSTANDS Charles. The actor does achieve one great moment when he insists on trying out the smack that his band are shooting up he registers if only for a brief moment a disgust at the unfairness of being blind and a life of darkness. The movie seems to want to dramatize the struggle within Charles between the bright salvation of music and the oblivion of heroin with his blindness as the battleground between those two compulsions. But the damn movie just won't take the time it bounces along from triumph to triumph never really pausing for any insight into the man. One has to STRETCH to find the dramatic tension one must supply the drama FOR the movie. One must in other words imagine a better movie than this one.

The filmmakers are too lazy to focus on any one of these elements. Two hours of watching a man overcome one adversity after another may make us feel good but such a movie is not necessarily a grand work of art.

First of all the plot is as you'd expect it from your average gangster biography nothing new nothing fancy in it. The way it is told makes the movie look a LOT longer than it is   thought the two hours should be almost over  was quite surprised that only  minutes had passed The action scenes look a lot like those from  TV series  the  for example. It's just that in the   with the  those scenes were far more sophisticated than those in ""El Padrino"" It's especially fun to see the guys point their guns in the air and still hit something  to talk about people that take cover behind car doors which later look like they've been shot through The acting fits quite nicely to the action. Either you get the same reaction to everything that happens  Lundgren style or it's so overacted that you may think it's a parody  unfortunately it's not My advise is to stay away from this movie any other gangster movie is better than this one.",0,1

3794_4.txt,""" tiny excellent rough low general main wonderful entertaining nice witty sudden gripping unsettling main real good suspenseful ambitious high talent more original insightful""","  went to see this  nights ago here in Cork Ireland. It was the world premiere of it in the tiny cinema in the Triskel Arts Centre as part of the Cork Film Festival.  found ""Strange Fruit"" to be an excellent movie. It is a bit rough around the edges but for a low movie that is to be expected! In general the acting  from the main lead Kent Faulcon is wonderful the cinematography and direction excellent and the script hugely entertaining and thought with some nice set and witty dialogue. The ending was a bit sudden with no conclusion given to characters and events once the finale came to its gripping end  but perhaps that's what the filmmakers were going for? It certainly did make the movie more unsettling.  did like the fact that the main character never came to terms with his mother on screen it leaves you wondering whether or not he ever will as in real sometimes these things are never settled. This was a good choice to leave it unresolved rather than sentimentally wrapping it up! Taut and suspenseful throughout ""Strange Fruit"" is a hugely ambitious debut and  have high hopes for what the writer Kyle Schickner will unleash next. He  and his colleagues  are a talent worth watching.  hope ""Strange Fruit"" gets a wider release soon as more people deserve to see this movie an above thriller with some original and insightful twists on homophobia and racism in America's Deep South.

The most beautiful part of this movie is the humans themselves. The people in the choir who are aged from  to  all have unique colorful lives and are very enjoyable beings. They are characterised by the harsh climate and the recession of the North and have adapted to the way of living required. Throughout the movie we learn a bit about many people in the choir and we follow them through songs some events in a church and on the harbour and in the end a trip to Murmansk. The outside environment filmed in the movie is very beautiful and characterised by the Norwegian nature. The scenography is also natural and taken directly from the choir and from the peoples lives that we meet. Thei  livingrooms the bathroom the kettle on the oven there is nothing artificial about this movie not the people not the environment not their music and not their feelings. Everything is as real as can be. It all loses out though when it comes to giving a story. It is very beautiful and real but why do we see it? Is it because of the songs? Is it because of the nature? Or is it simply just to see a story about Berlev Mens about their life and some of the trips they have. The message if there is any is that this small society copes with life through such social events like the choir. The choir have kept the people together for many many years. It is all nice but being as popular as it has been seen by almost  in Norway there is something wrong. There is no beginning or end to it. Nobody gains or loses anything nobody reveals any message or tries to convince the audience of that this is good or that life up there is great. Why was this movie made?  am sorry. It is a nice movie about good people but compared to the average European Scandinavian or Norwegian movie  this does not deserve a  out of  It is closer to  out of  and that is what  will give it. If you see this movie in a theater you should expect the average age on the audience to be around  It has reported to be consistently high in all theaters. Maybe this is also the reason for it receiving such very high praise in the news and good grades also on the IMDB It is a movie about elders for elders.

11803_2.txt,""" true opposite funny realistic doubtful true other true true Your better more true""","  was surprised that the makers of this movie actually came out said that this movie was a true story. The majority of the scenes looked fake to me. For instance when the one girl was eating her sandwich and there was a roach in it. While she was eating the sandwich the camera on the opposite side of it showed that there was a roach on it. It's funny how the camera just happened to be filming on the sandwich when the girl was eating it. Another scene is when the gang went to open a clothes closet and a cat flew out of the closet or should  say it was thrown out to give it effect. This movie was not realistic at all. It's highly doubtful that the events that happened were true that evening when the ""St. Francisville Experiment"" took place.  believe that the house may be haunted but not on the night this movie was filmed! The ending was amusing when Tim and and other girl were chained down in the some sort of basement. Paul and Madison found them and rescued them!  would rather watch the Blair Witch Project again then have to sit through the St. Francisville Experiment movie again.

Zeffirelli intended this movie as a homage to Sir Laurence Olivier  had died  years prior to this movie and it works pretty well for the most part. What  was slightly uncomfortable with was Zeffirelli's misplacing a lot of lines and in one scene he gives one of Hamlet's lines to the Ghost. Also Helena Bonham DID NOT convince me as Ophelia. She was too dull and unreal whereas Jean Simmons  had immortalized the role in Olivier's version and Kate Winslet  did an acceptable job in Kenneth Branagh's uncut epic revisionist reworking of ""Hamlet"" were good in the role with Jean Simmons being the BEST Ophelia ever that's why she was nominated for Best Actress in   didn't win a shame Ian Holm said his lines too quickly not slowly as  expected him to in a scene with him Laertes and Ophelia. But then again I'm more used to Felix Aylmer and Richard Briers interpretations of the role and  think that they did better jobs than Holm in their respective versions of ""Hamlet""  done by great directors actors text producers AND stars of all their versions of the Bard's work as Polonius. The rest of the cast however was excellent. The scene where Hamlet confronts his mother was very well done but Olivier and Branagh heightened the scene to better lengths to create even more emotional intensity and suspense that the scene required.  recommend this version just to pass the time but it's ideal as a teaching tool for  English teachers  recommend showing Olivier's version first then Branagh's and finally this version Despite the film's ""PG"" rating there was really nothing objectionable in the movie. Only what the play called for. The Best Versions Of ""Hamlet"" Are  Sir Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh. Both were so good that  can't decide which one was the best. See my reviews on these versions for more information.  Franco Zeffirelli. This one was alright. It started out alright with a scene not in the play but should've then progressed to the actual beginning of the play where a guard cries out ""Who's there? ""Nay answer me. Stand and unfold yourself! That scene scares the hell out of you because you're sitting quietly and then you almost jump out of your skin. In short that scene sets the tone for the rest of the play. HUGE blunder on Zeffirelli's part to omit that scene. It also misplaced a lot of lines  cut others that  think should've been put in such as the line where Hamlet says to Ophelia ""Get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? that line was supposed to have occurred in THAT scene NOT where it was placed in the film  the ""To Be Or Not To Be"" soliloquy. This version struggles between cutting out too much or too little from an excellent piece of literature. Kenneth Branagh would remedy that  years later with his uncut version of the tragedy making HIS version a more fitting homage to Sir Laurence Olivier as several of the actors  from him had performed ""Hamlet"" on stage on film many times on different occasions. However Zeffirelli's take on ""Hamlet"" IS faithful to the play and THAT's what  was looking for. The setup for the final act duel was the same as in Olivier and Branagh's versions only that the denouement in Branagh's version was more violent than the denouement of the previous two faithful versions  in line with the play Olivier toned it down. it worked equally well and stuck more closely to the play with Branagh throwing in a few harmless touches of his own. very good effect. This version is Not Rated.",0,1

Or they are admirers of Bernard Tavernier or both. Even as a fan of all the actors  especially Vince  felt it was such a waste of their talents overall gave good performances in a film that didn't hold together. Now  say this having only seen the USA DVD and hoping that Tavernier's cut will make a huge difference. On the plus side The soundtrack was wonderful. The scenes at Robicheaux's place were perfect as  imagined the bait shop to look like. Mary Steenburgen was excellent as Bootsie as was Walter Breaux as Batist. If you read the books you know why Robicheaux is an even person in the beginning of the film and then starts whacking people with various instruments.

But in his powerful dramatic performance in The Wrestler  we see a full blown presentation of the character only hinted at in Get Carter. Whenever we get to know him Rourke remains a cool but sleazy muscle bound slim ball. This is an Elmore Leonard story and production. Leonard wrote such notable movies as taunt western thriller  to Yuma Be Cool Jackie Brown Get Shorty  Pick and Joe Kidd. This means that we get tough guys some good some not so good. It also means we get tight realistic plots with characters doing what is best for them in each situation weaving complications into violent conclusions. Killshot is no different. Tough slim ball killer Rourke stalks unhappily married witness Lane. Think History of Violence meets No Country for Old Men. It is not as intense bloody or gory as those two but it is almost as good. If you like those two including David Croneberg's equally wonderful Eastern Promises you will like Killshot also. Director John Madden has not done a lot of movies. His last few were enjoyable if not successful Proof Captain Corelli's Mandolin and Shakespeare in Love. Diana Lane hasn't had a powerful movie role since she and Richard Gere gave incredible performances in Unfaithful. Lately she is charming and appealing in romantic stories such as Nights in Rodanthe Must Love Dogs and Under the Tuscan Sun. Here she is right on mark balancing her sexy appeal with reserved tension. This is a small part for Rosario Dawson. Yet Dawson does a good job with it. You see a lot more of Lane including an underwear scene to rival Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut. While you are in the crime drama section also pick up Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Gone Baby Gone and Before the Devil Knows Your Dead.

It would have been economical suicide for Preminger to produce a film of the opera  it would have lost a fortune for the Goldwyn Studios. That said this is a fine adaptation. The acting is excellent the Oscar winning scoring of Andre Previn is magnificent as is the choral singing and the individual vocal achievements are incredible. Robert McFerrin  of popular musician Bobby McFerrin dubbed Porgy and Adele Addison dubbed Bess. While Sammy Davis Jr. sang his own songs in the film his recording contract would not permit his voice to be heard on the soundtrack album so Cab Calloway recorded his numbers  for that release. Brock Peters bass is extraordinary and Pearl Bailey is her own unique self. Diahann Carroll although a singer of fine note has the small role of Clara which required a high soprano so old reliable Marni Nixon dubbed her singing. The Gershwin Estate hates the film and refuses to grant the musical rights although the dramatic rights are in the public domain. This sort of hate feud held up the video release of CAROUSEL for almost fifteen years  in that case it was the dramatic rights that were in litigation and is currently preventing both PORGY AND BESS and ANNIE GET YOUR GUN from being released on video. Of all the stage productions given film versions it is these latter two which are the sole holdouts to video. Only a campaign of letters to the Gershwin Estate in NY might loosen up the reserve.",0,1

Brazilian chicks will be happy to expose   of their incredible bodies at the Samba Schools parades and wear almost non bikinis at beach but never go topless.  handful beaches across the whole country will allow it. All carefully secluded and out of town. Oh the indoor decoration the amazing wallpaper. maybe in Disneyworld. Apart from that it is very entertaining and yes Demi Moore is absolutely splendid.,0,1
11716_2.txt,""" greatest best little realistic visual hard such sophisticated tiny large naked much younger educated able subtle human symbolic able deeply personal many earlier other lesser cheap special top best s blind only copious full unnecessary greatest slight""", This has to be one of the all time greatest horror movies. Charles Band made the best movie of  in this little seen gem. Highly realistic and  incredibly stylised with a visual flair David Fincher would envy its not hard to see why Band went on to make such classics as   Deliverance From Evil  Regina Pierce Affair  of Sherwood Forest and  Tales of the Saddle Tramps With a highly sophisticated story a tiny body with a large head controls a family of weirdos who perform experiments on naked women this movie may be a bit too much for younger viewers and is only for the most educated type of viewer but for those who see it Band is able to convey subtle messages about the human condition through his masterpiece. The head is symbolic of the lost love and longing for one's inner self that we all must face at one point or another and for this reason  was able to engage with this film on a deeply personal level. Although many earlier critics have compared Band's film to Re and other lesser works this stands head and heels above the rest. It is gorier but not pointlessly. The gore in this film is well crafted and used to enhance the storyline rather than to just get a cheap shriek out of the audience. Also the special effects in this film are absolutely top notch easily the best work done in a horror film since. well. ever! The work in this film makes Savini's effects look like the work of a blind limbless hobo. The only problem  have with this film is the copious amounts of full frontal nudity which were ultimately unnecessary in achieving the composer's goal to create a timeless epic that would forever go down in history as possibly the greatest film of all time. If it were not for this slight problem  would have given this film a perfect ,0,1
2919_4.txt,""" classic good little rainy right American missionary American corrupt political perfect current s underworld current rich physical silent understated good good racist typical black mean other close best good enough more""", While this isn't an all time classic comedy it is a pretty good little movie to watch if you catch it on a rainy Saturday morning with not a lot else going on right then. Harold Lloyd plays Ezekiel Cobb an American coming home after growing up in China where his dad was a missionary. has come home from China to find an American wife and plans to return to China to continue his father's work. unwittingly is recruited to run for mayor of his corrupt home town when the existing political machine that controls the town realizes that he would make a perfect patsy to run against the current mayor who also is the head of the town's underworld. figure the bumbling  Cobb has no chance to win and therefore the current mayor continues to run the town and run his schemes which makes them all rich. Lloyd isn't doing the physical comedy here like he did in his silent films. does a convincing portrayal of Cobb with a reserved understated dignity. acting was good from all involved and the story and script were also quite good. Being made in  the film does have some rather racist language when talking about the Chinese and it also has a typical black character from that era but these stereotypes aren't nearly as mean as I've seen from other films from that time. Although not close to being Lloyd's best film  movie does entertain and Lloyd is very good as Cobb. won't be blown away by this film but it may be enough to peak your interest in Lloyd and make you want to see more of his work.,0,1

2399_3.txt,""" sure correct future great greatest red American adorable big smart wonderful greatest bang"""," I'm sure that the folks who made this movie think they're doing something wonderfully politically correct because they manage to criticize  wars in Afghanistan and particularly Iraq by suggesting that the  does war well but doesn't clean up afterward thus sowing the seeds for future trouble. Furthermore they do this without making Islamists the enemy AND without making Republicans the enemy since it's the Republicans that are in office and are doing this supposedly great thing bringing down the USSR by covertly supplying a war in Afghanistan. But seriously now    do we really want a movie that repeatedly says ""let's go kill some Russians! like that's the greatest thing a red American can do? And are we supposed to find this congressman adorable because he surrounds himself with women with big hair and revealing clothes? Even his supposedly smart assistant who is always dressed professionally keeps looking at Charlie like he's just the most wonderful handsomest greatest guy around. As if she's Nancy Reagan to his Ronnie. Julia Roberts does a bang job in her role but basically women are really demeaned in this movie and it was really annoying.",0,1

Then with that beautiful cast recording fresh in mind watch the movie with Streisand as Streisand and Yves Montand reading his lines with such a heavy French accent that a chain saw couldn't cut through it. The best part  those who need something to look forward to is what Montand does to the introductory part of the title song. Listen as he sings Could anyone among us have an inkling or a clue what magic feats of wizardry and voodoo you can do?  one part sums up the problem that results from casting ""name stars"" in movie musicals instead of the appropriate talent for the various roles.  can just see Rex Harrison entering that scene and suggesting Montand too could learn to do justice to the beauty of the English language.

Postman Tin Cup Waterworld Bodyguard Wyatt Earp Robin Hood even that baseball movie. Seems like he makes movies specifically to be the center of attention.

You'll know what will happen way before it happens. This is like mixing An Officer and a Gentleman with Backdraft but both are easily better movies.

563_4.txt,""" lighthearted comical first serious marble great good early dated young many neat more many many real interesting many incalculable favorite early main easy worth historical funny early entertaining"""," This movie should have been called ""The Eyes of Alexander"" and they should have done away with the Bogart concept altogether. The film started out with a lighthearted approach to Bogart's legacy and some comical moments with his surgery oriented face but after the first  minutes it morphs into a more serious thriller where two palm size sapphires purportedly laid as eyes into a marble headpiece of Alexander the Great for him and seen by him right before his death. So the gems are of great value not only because of their quality and size but also because of the tie to the Greatest conquerer the world has ever known. Being an expert on Alexander qualifies me to say that this is wholly and completely a fiction but it makes for a good movie anyway. So the film winds around some early silliness and stumbles along with all sorts of Alexander allusions in both the foreground and background   really liked ending with a dated shark attack  couldn't go to a movie in  without some shark showing up to menace the audience There is a yacht named Euridice  father's young wife a man named Alexander Philip Cleitus?  been about  years since I've seen the film so can't remember all the details Olympias some street names and many others. It was fun to watch the film just to try to catch all the background details that the director  an Alexanderphile himself put in. When all is said and done the eyes are retrieved and the camera pans in on them on a bed as the credits roll by. Kind of a neat ending. What would have been more fun would be if they went the Indiana Jones way and had an action adventure. There were many many real artifacts that could have been used to make this more interesting or instance the hand  Aristotle version of the Iliad that Alexander kept with him all his life even on his many journeys across Asia  be of incalculable value if found today Olivia Hussey  all time favorite  actress killed off way too early and should have been the main actress throughout not the girl from the Momma's and the Poppa's. she was herself easy on the eyes. If you can find this flick it might be worth checking out for the historical stuff and to see Olivia Hussey in an extremely funny deadpan humor bit early on but beyond that I'd pass on it for something more entertaining.
