His last few were enjoyable if not successful Proof Captain Corelli's Mandolin and Shakespeare in Love. Diana Lane hasn't had a powerful movie role since she and Richard Gere gave incredible performances in Unfaithful. Lately she is charming and appealing in romantic stories such as Nights in Rodanthe Must Love Dogs and Under the Tuscan Sun. Here she is right on mark balancing her sexy appeal with reserved tension. This is a small part for Rosario Dawson. Yet Dawson does a good job with it. You see a lot more of Lane including an underwear scene to rival Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut. While you are in the crime drama section also pick up Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Gone Baby Gone and Before the Devil Knows Your Dead. The last has wonderful performances by Phillip Seymour Hoffman Ethan Hawke Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney. Killshot flopped at the box office. More is our luck. It is certainly worth a  dollar rental if you like this genre. ,0,1

The priest see the hypocrisy of the people in his church and try to show them the `` naked '' truth . The people are appalled when he reveals the naked statue portraying truth after failing to lead them to it and the few that did help along the way . The people do not want to face the truth that they are doing anything wrong but it show them putting thing before God going to beach party acting inappropriate their materialistic way and other thing in which the people of our world do that tend to not be morally right . In the end failing to gain any follower he must enter into the gate of heaven alone .

11653_3.txt,""" Based on the comment made so far everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it . think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a GREAT movie it ha it interesting moment . For one thing it wa filmed on location in Colorado it Breckinridge or Telluride ? ca n't remember but it is in the credit The location is absolutely stunning and spectacular . It 's beautiful even to me who lived in Colorado for several year . Next it ha Disney 's penchant for wonderful character actor . Harry Morgan ha never been in better form than when he play in a Disney movie . He is literally hysterical . Also remember the wonderful Mary Wickes ?

She ha always been a great character actress and most character actor never receive the recognition they deserve . In addition to character actor and all cast in the Disney may have not had the `` greatest '' movie but if you really watch some of them from beginning to end you will NOTICE that every movie ha some really funny or hysterical moment in it . The entire movie may not be funny but there is always a comic gem least or in every single `` live movie Disney ever made .

Disney in this time period always managed to make a person smile despite the dumbness of the film .

Rather it is easier for me to give credit to the funny moment and overlook the weakness in the plot .
