Maybe this is even a good thing forcing the acting and writing to have to step up and take their rightful place in film as the centers of the work instead of as afterthoughts used to have an excuse to make CGI fights  The cgi is fine. It is not exactly  but imho it still works. why? because there isn't too much of it and what there is is not  over with an army of effects house people trying to cram everything they can into the shot. it prompts the imagination. it's some relatively simple stuff with decent composition  the heavy freighter shot. there is one long shot that must be at least ten seconds. tracks the entire length of the ship. it must be a record for sci fi battle sequence film making in the past  years to have an action sequence that lasts longer than  seconds and some relation to the story. it might look old or not  of the art but it doesn't look stupid and it doesn't take away from the story. The acting is good except the characters die too fast to get to know them. The captain was great but a few of his scenes could have used another take.  also got confused with his character losing his cool and stomping on a corpse  like to think captains are calm cool and in control. what was going on in that scene? did the other crew worry about him losing it at that moment? did he feel himself losing control? Now as for the plot. mostly it is good. why? Because it doesn't try to explain itself. It just happens. It's called  planet its a mystery get it? Nobody knows why there is a statue and they don't find out either. The mysterious cult? The weird scientist with the tattoo? What do you expect to find out in less than  minutes? This isn't War and Peace. And thank god it's not star wars either. No midichlorians no  minutes of expository boring dialog that has no purpose in the story. The characters are stranded and are only able to figure out a few basic things. it is not a star trek episode where they find out it's leonardo davinci or a child like space wanderer. It is mysterious and  liked that.  don't know why maybe  can identify with these guys more  since they don't know whats happening and  don't either. they don't talk a lot of space gibberish or have magic boxes telling them what is happening. In fact  would argue that one of the weakest moments is when the  turns on the crew and tries to  the reason for the planet the cult etc. This coincidentally has some of the weakest dialog imho in the whole movie and it interrupts the flow and some of the characters look unnatural in that scene. OK sometimes  felt it was a little too mysterious though. Like why did the guy get fried through his eyes with lightning? That was odd. Just weird. The  ending. again  would have liked to have known some of these characters better. And would it have been so hard to have a  second rescue scene at the end? This is not a serial show it was a film and we like closure in films even if they can have a sequel. Imagine Hamlet with no  of angels sing thee to thy rest Anyways. What can  say. This was well worth the dollar  payed at the  box machine at the supermarket. It was also imho a better piece of storytelling than starwars parts   or  Like  said it sucked me in wanting to know what was happening and  couldn't stop watching until the end.,1,0

The film Haggard The Movie also has a lot of the characters from Jackass etc but to say it was written by Bam Margera and Co. this is a very weak attempt seems to me like it was written when he was bored or as a project with they did not pay a lot of attention to. The films also stars Bam's girlfriend Jennifer Rivell who plays Glauren Ryan's girlfriend who basically cheated on him again very bad acting by Jennifer another actor that some people may be interested in is Steve  Hellboy played by RakeYohn which his character does not seem to be with the story again bad acting also this character does not really have a lot of lines in this film which basically makes it very boring. but worst of all is Raab's character the voice sound like a smoker who basically has throat cancer also  think he could have been improved! Overall  think the characters in this film aren't with the story like in one scene it would be on one certain character a minute later a different scene different character. To say that this is supposed to be a film sort of a documentary its not played by the characters as a documentary the acting makes you think that its a cheap attempt at making a film with your spare time. Towards the middle of the film we start to lose focus on the main character Ryan Dunn although a lot of the attention is on Bam and Brandon. In conclusion this film is OK if you laugh at things that aren't very funny stupid stunts terrible acting and the occasional nude scene! Also  think there there are too many scenes of just no talking and just music! ,1,0

So many wonderful rich moments in the miniseries and to an even greater degree the book are completely missing in ""Moon. Considering the fact that most viewers of ""Moon"" are probably coming with at least some sort of ""Dove"" background the lack of character and emotional backstory is downright painful.

To its credit the miniseries tries to service the Comanches but in the end it gives them just enough that the viewer just gets a sense they're missing out on some important part of the story. Similarly Val Kilmer's Scull loses out here too  the role should have either been expanded so Kilmer  Rachel Griffiths for that matter actually had something to do or the roles should have just been reduced to smaller supporting parts. Instead Kilmer gets top billing for a character that just leaves you scratching your head after his appearance in the completely bizarre final act. There's strange moments throughout the film that just make no sense to those who haven't read the book  killer parrot? what?  further there isn't a single scene that shows us that Call and McCrae are anything near the amazing Texas rangers they claim to be. Not a single one of their expeditions in Moon  ""Dead Man's Walk for that matter ends successfully and Call and McCrae just seem to blunder their way through one pointless mission after another. Frankly Larry McMurtry should never have been given the job of writing the script and only did so because of the praise surrounding that other cowboy movie Brokeback Mountain. McMurtry can write good novels  there's some dissension over the consistency of that statement but he's never exactly established himself as a scriptwriter. This production would have benefited from not only bringing back director Wincer but original screenwriter Bill Wittcliff to adapt the novel to screen. Witcliff doesn't exactly have a mountainload of material to his screen writing credit but no one can deny he did a fantastic job at whittling down the original ""Lonesome Dove. With all this said ""Comanche Moon"" is almost a brilliant production aided by a terrific cast that unfortunately just aren't given enough to do. Steve Zahn's portrayal of Gus McCrae  or rather his portrayal of Robert Duvall as Gus McCrae  is dead And while some have criticized Karl Urban as Woodrow Call saying his performance doesn't imitate the quiet stoic Woodrow of the original movie all  can say is blame McMurtry because McMurtry is the one who  both in the ""Moon"" novel and now the miniseries  turned Woodrow from socially inept awkward but natural leader into some emotionless character whose lines are just dull and whose character motivations are only clear if you've seen them portrayed far more adequately in the ""sequel"" Still it's the cast that sparkles in ""Moon to the degree that  left the miniseries with that same feeling of melancholy  felt watching the original ""Lonesome Dove""  this time because  realized it's probably the last time we'll see these characters appear on screen for a long long time to come  and quite honestly this cast could have done so well in a well full network TV series. All in all aside from wasted opportunities with the cast the biggest travesty is that the original Lonesome Dove novel contained so much rich backstory for the characters that would have been fascinating utterly fascinating to see translated on screen. Unfortunately all that has been tossed aside in favor of McMurtry's tedious inconsistent and ultimately irrelevant prequel.",1,0

It isn't that this movie is necessarily bad for your health but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie. You can count the number of pages by Anne Rice that I've read on one hand but after seeing this movie and Interview with a Vampire  get the feeling that she writes really good novels. The plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history. Still Stuart Townsend's voice narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than Brad Pitt's vampire narrative ever did and you can tell that QUEEN OF THE DAMNED's limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the Anne Rice storyline. While Interview decided to go with lace and elegance QUEEN relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously. One can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places. The costumes and rock  roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack. However I'll give credit where credit is due. The soundtrack is excellent. Korn and Disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like Butthead. The film opens with a very cool Goth zoom  splice montage but after the first ten minutes or so the directing degenerates quickly. It's as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasn't enough time and enough money to do an Anne Rice novel justice. What results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects. Unfortunately QUEEN OF THE DAMNED fails to do the genre justice just as its John Carpenter counterparts fail to impress. Where are the yellow contacts? Where's the pale blue make Scene after scene  shook my head reminiscing about the days of Salem's Lot and Fright Night when low budget was done right. There are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage. Props to Aaliyah and may her soul forever rest in peace. She might have become a renowned actress had her life not been taken from us so prematurely for she did give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing. Did  mention that the soundtrack was good? Let's see what else can  say? It wasn't too long. The Anne Rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like Francis Ford Coppola got his hands on it. There are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot. But all in all it was a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of second vampire movies out there. The director of this movie went on to direct a new Battlestar Galactica mini series if that tells you anything. JY Jimboduck,1,0

This has gotten some of the worst reviews I've ever seen for a motion picture.  love the original and have seen it MANY times was constantly comparing it to that. Now this isn't a classic but it's not that bad.  SPOILERS! First the bad story is old and was  updated. Really man cheating on his wife is hardly shocking today. Meg Ryan  wonderful actress is pretty terrible here. Her face seems unable to change expression!  couldn't believe how bad some of her scenes came over. Eva Mendes is bad too it's not entirely her fault. Her role is badly written and she has to compete with Joan Crawford from the original. Smith's character  tough lesbian goes to pieces in an operating room. It IS funny. it's showing that a strong woman instantly goes to pieces when confronting an emergency. Also the script inserts some clumsy passages where Ryan talks to her daughter about being yourself. In those moments it seems more like a Lifetime movie than anything else. Now the good movie retains the originals decision to NEVER show a man on screen. This movie is about and for women aren't needed  a man Bening is just great as Fowler she's on screen the movie makes a great leap. Also Smith is just wonderful doesn't overplay  underplay her lesbian character too much. Messing is good too but she's not in this much. Bette Midler is just hysterical in a small role and Cloris Leachman pulls off the nothing role of a housekeeper. The direction is good too during a fashion show sequence.  heard director Diane English purportedly had a lot of trouble directing her first full movie but it doesn't show in the final product.

Naturally the film is rather messy therefore but the fact that all three monsters are there is usually enough to ensure that the film's sixty seven minutes don't become boring. It's obvious that the idea of making another monster mash came into the writer's head before an actual plot did as the yarn we're given isn't exactly without holes. The plot sees Count Dracula arrive at Dr. Edelman's home asking for a cure for his vampirism. Then what can only be described as a coincidence sees Lawrence Talbot  The Wolf Man turn up asking for a cure for his affliction! It turns out that Dracula is on the prowl for Edelman's daughter but Talbot really is serious. When it turns out that he can't be stopped from turning into a wolf The Wolf Man throws himself into the sea. he ends up finding Frankenstein's Monster. Overall this film isn't as good as the earlier House of Frankenstein. The  film put its plot together better than this entry in the series does as the plot here doesn't give equal time to each Universal monster. Dracula's plot is the biggest at first but soon fizzles out only to resurface at the end. The Wolf Man is the star of the show but his story never really develops and is essentially just another version of the plot he always finds himself in. Frankenstein's Monster is given the coldest hand as he appears in the movie merely as an afterthought and an obvious excuse to ensure that all three monsters appear in the movie. The story of the doctor who binds all three together is the most interesting but this is a little disappointing as he isn't the reason why people will see this film. The acting is good enough with John Carradine showing his sinister side and Lon Chaney Jr once again making sure that his character is bathed in tragedy. Glenn Strange is given nothing to do and Onslow Stevens proves the real highlight as Dr Edelman. Overall this film won't do much for anyone that isn't a fan of Universal horror but as silly monster movies go House of Dracula is worth seeing.,1,0

The first few minutes of the movie had me worried  it starts with one of Micks tired ""get angry at insignificant things"" routines but that was given a neat touch which at least made it a little refreshing. The rest of the script was pretty good and very light hearted  even the typical Mick Molloy  Judith Lucy humour was delivered well and whilst  never had to pick myself up from the aisles it generated a lot more chuckles that  was expecting  it was consistant There's nothing new in the plot  pretty predictable but it moved along quickly between one and other jokes   never felt it harboured on any element too long or too short Mick must have worked hard on polishing his script. There were a one or two ""Late Show"" in and one or two jokes that only Melbournians would get  but certainly there's plenty of generic stuff in there for a wider audience. Something that  found disappointing was the relative unfunnyness of John Clarke  he just didn't seem to work as the bad guy but that doesn't detract from the movie too much. Over all  enjoyed this Australain comedy and was pleasantly entertained for the duration of the movie.  left the cinema with a decent sized grin  a pretty hard thing for an Australian comedy to do in my books.

He has had a steady string of appearances before he burst back on the scene. He was memorable in Domino Sin City Man on Fire Once Upon a Time in Mexico and Get Carter. But in his powerful dramatic performance in The Wrestler  we see a full blown presentation of the character only hinted at in Get Carter. Whenever we get to know him Rourke remains a cool but sleazy muscle bound slim ball. This is an Elmore Leonard story and production. Leonard wrote such notable movies as taunt western thriller  to Yuma Be Cool Jackie Brown Get Shorty  Pick and Joe Kidd. This means that we get tough guys some good some not so good. It also means we get tight realistic plots with characters doing what is best for them in each situation weaving complications into violent conclusions. Killshot is no different. Tough slim ball killer Rourke stalks unhappily married witness Lane. Think History of Violence meets No Country for Old Men. It is not as intense bloody or gory as those two but it is almost as good. If you like those two including David Croneberg's equally wonderful Eastern Promises you will like Killshot also. Director John Madden has not done a lot of movies. His last few were enjoyable if not successful Proof Captain Corelli's Mandolin and Shakespeare in Love. Diana Lane hasn't had a powerful movie role since she and Richard Gere gave incredible performances in Unfaithful. Lately she is charming and appealing in romantic stories such as Nights in Rodanthe Must Love Dogs and Under the Tuscan Sun. Here she is right on mark balancing her sexy appeal with reserved tension. This is a small part for Rosario Dawson. Yet Dawson does a good job with it. You see a lot more of Lane including an underwear scene to rival Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut. While you are in the crime drama section also pick up Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Gone Baby Gone and Before the Devil Knows Your Dead.

Rather it is easier for me to give credit to the funny moments and overlook the weaknesses in the plots. Some live Disney movies are true classics  Yeller Bedknobs and Broomsticks Mary Poppins but for those that aren't  am able to appreciate them for what they were  good clean family fun in a time when movies had become vulgar crude and offensive.",0,1

Now that I'm a little older  can say that although it's thoroughly average  still consider it one of his better films. In an acting stretch for him Norris plays a cop haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie. Serial Killers are all the rage nowadays and people would like to think of them as a wholly  invention. In contrast it's good to see where the current infatuation has sprung from most obviously action movies  well as stalk  slashers of  and  While Norris attempts at both humour and any form of human compassion are ham and laughable nobody could kick someone in the head quite like Chuck. Being a big fan of Steve James also  can recommend this film ditto for genre legend Billy Drago as well as seeing Mitch from The Blue Brothers in a supporting role. Not great but it's better than anything Norris did in the ,0,1

It has not  my knowledge been released on DVD or VHS although  shall browse around for a copy. The film tells the story of three young people two girls one on the edge of puberty and the other much younger and a young boy who go to live with their mother's brother and his young mute Irish wife. His wife also has two brothers who live with them. The children's uncle is an unpleasant control freak who forces his young wife to wear a silver collar whilst she watches a marionette show put on by him and her brothers in his toyshop. The eldest girl and one of the Irishmen  younger develop a love for each other whilst they live in the same house. The girl helps her aunt out in the shop whilst her brother helps his uncle to make things in the workshop. There are a lot of very disturbing elements to the film. There is the uncle's treatment of his wife as some kind of dumb  possession  by the collar whilst the Irish indulge dancing drinking and somewhat forbidden love. Interestingly though  have seen far more explicit themes played out in other movies made in Hollywood today. Makes you wonder whether the British film industry and the BBC have some kind of hidden agenda going on. Still despite it not being a children's movie there are a lot of playful magic moments in it and the one Irishman does some beautiful paintings.,0,1

Martha is more secluded and Mario is not a clown. In most of the cases the things that makes one scene great in the original its is not working in its copy here. The small alterations take away the tension. My opinion is that you should go and see the original. It'll worth the inconvenience of subtitles.,0,1
