2673_9.txt, when the movie first started  thought cheesy. the first ten minutes were really boring. after the slow beginning and some of the soap opera antics  started liking it. the plot was different than anything  had ever seen. now was it a horror? not really. it shouldn't have been classied as a horror or the producers should have put more money into the movie to make it scary. as it was the creatures where only there for a short time.  can only assume this was for money reason. the good side was that the movie was very entertaining. it held my interest  the start and did make me wonder about creatures from another dimension. it was obvious that this was a first time movie for the director but there were a couple of highlights. by the end  was hooked. too bad hollywood didn't put more money behind this., When the movie first started  thought cheesy.

The trailer doesn't give away any of the plot FOR GOOD REASON. The premise is absurd so it's nice to see that it doesn't take itself seriously. It's like someone from the BBC children's department decided to make a film for adults. That's not a bad thing IMO. ,1,0

7116_7.txt, house of dracula works from the same basic premise as house of frankenstein from the year before namely that universal's three most famous monsters dracula frankenstein's monster and the wolf man are appearing in the movie together. naturally the film is rather messy therefore but the fact that all three monsters are there is usually enough to ensure that the film's sixty seven minutes don't become boring. it's obvious that the idea of making another monster mash came into the writer's head before an actual plot did as the yarn we're given isn't exactly without holes. the plot sees count dracula arrive at dr. edelman's home asking for a cure for his vampirism. then what can only be described as a coincidence sees lawrence talbot  the wolf man turn up asking for a cure for his affliction! it turns out that dracula is on the prowl for edelman's daughter but talbot really is serious. when it turns out that he can't be stopped from turning into a wolf the wolf man throws himself into the sea. he ends up finding frankenstein's monster. overall this film isn't as good as the earlier house of frankenstein. the  film put its plot together better than this entry in the series does as the plot here doesn't give equal time to each universal monster. dracula's plot is the biggest at first but soon fizzles out only to resurface at the end. the wolf man is the star of the show but his story never really develops and is essentially just another version of the plot he always finds himself in. frankenstein's monster is given the coldest hand as he appears in the movie merely as an afterthought and an obvious excuse to ensure that all three monsters appear in the movie. the story of the doctor who binds all three together is the most interesting but this is a little disappointing as he isn't the reason why people will see this film. the acting is good enough with john carradine showing his sinister side and lon chaney jr once again making sure that his character is bathed in tragedy. glenn strange is given nothing to do and onslow stevens proves the real highlight as dr edelman. overall this film won't do much for anyone that isn't a fan of universal horror but as silly monster movies go house of dracula is worth seeing., House of Dracula works from the same basic premise as House of Frankenstein from the year before namely that Universal's three most famous monsters Dracula Frankenstein's Monster and The Wolf Man are appearing in the movie together.
