Whenever we get to know him, Rourke remains a cool, but sleazy, muscle bound slim ball.<br /><br />This is an Elmore Leonard story, and production. Leonard wrote such notable movies as taunt western thriller 3:10 to Yuma, Be Cool, Jackie Brown, Get Shorty, 52 Pick-Up, and Joe Kidd. This means that we get tough guys, some good, some not so good.<br /><br />It also means we get tight, realistic plots with characters doing what is best for them in each situation, weaving complications into violent conclusions. Killshot is no different. Tough, slim ball killer Rourke stalks unhappily married witness Lane. Think History of Violence meets No Country for Old Men. It is not as intense, bloody or gory as those two, but it is almost as good. If you like those two, including David Croneberg's equally wonderful Eastern Promises, you will like Killshot also.<br /><br />Director John Madden has not done a lot of movies. His last few were enjoyable, if not successful: Proof, Captain Corelli's Mandolin and Shakespeare in Love.<br /><br />Diana Lane hasn't had a powerful movie role since she and Richard Gere gave incredible performances in Unfaithful. Lately she is charming and appealing in romantic stories such as Nights in Rodanthe, Must Love Dogs, and Under the Tuscan Sun. Here she is right on mark, balancing her sexy appeal with reserved tension.<br /><br />This is a small part for Rosario Dawson. Yet Dawson does a good job with it. You see a lot more of Lane, including an underwear scene to rival Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut.<br /><br />While you are in the crime drama section, also pick up Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang, and Gone Baby Gone, and Before the Devil Knows Your Dead. The last has wonderful performances by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney.<br /><br />Killshot flopped at the box office. More is our luck. It is certainly worth a 3-4 dollar rental, if you like this genre. 6/20/2009",0,1
9528_1.txt,"lois weber's film ""hypocrites"" was and still kind of is a very bold and daring film. i enjoyed it and was very impressed by the filming and story of it. the priest sees the hypocrisy of the people in his church and tries to show them the ""naked"" truth. the people are appalled when he reveals the naked statue portraying truth, after failing to lead them to it and the few that did, help along the way. the people do not want to face the truth that they are doing anything wrong, but it shows them putting things before god, going to beach parties acting inappropriate, their materialistic ways, and other things in which the people of our world do that tend to not be morally right. in the end, failing to gain any followers, he must enter into the gates of heaven alone. this film seems to me to be very bold, in the fact that a naked woman is shown throughout it, especially considering the time period in which this film was made. the imagery and symbolism portrayed in this movie i found incredible. the way they made the naked woman translucent and using a naked woman to symbolize the naked truth shows a lot of creativity and art. showing the different sins of the people as they walked down the road and refused to follow along the path, each with different excuses, setbacks, and/or higher priorities, was a great way of representing the people of today. this film does a very good job of getting the moral message across to its audience. lois weber has a tremendous way of capturing her spectators' attention with her creativity, symbolism, visuals, and through auditory. even the music of the piano throughout this film is very beautiful and fitting with the whole theme.","Lois Weber's film ""Hypocrites"" was and still kind of is a very bold and daring film.
