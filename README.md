## Data Set
The data set consists of [50,000 IMDb movie reviews](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) (Stanford University) divided into a validation set, test set, and training set. 

The validation set contains 5,000 reviews with randomly selected sentiments (both positive and negative) from a corpus of 25,000 balanced data sentiments, the training set contains the 20,000 remaining reviews, and the test set contains 25,000 balanced reviews. Also included is a set of all 50,000 unlabeled balanced reviews.

## Experiment
