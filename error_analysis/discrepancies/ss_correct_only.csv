6655_7.txt,1, went into this film thinking was n't going to like it but hoping to be surprised but this much like the film ended up being bleak and hopeless . But do n't get me wrong Minghella delivers every bit of a grand epic and for those who enjoy that kind of experience and are willing to take that adventure and accept what comes as just that then they will not be disappointed and it will be one of the better films of the year in their opinion . The acting is of a high quality and will most likely come away with a trinity of oscar noms for Law Kidman and Zellweger even though Portman's few scenes may be the most powerful in the film . The locations are beautiful and Minghella has an eye for a good shot . However for those like me who want the director to take them on the adventure instead of going willingly may come away disappointed mainly due to Minghella and his adaptation . The film is so utterly bleak it makes for what consider to be a punching bag epic which is a film that that tries to hit hard with emotion but does so to such an extreme and so often that during the film did n't have the time to emotionally invest or had n't recovered from a previous blow and it became unrealistic and consequently too difficult to really care not to mention predictable . Overall the Cold Mountain'' almost left me too drained to even think back on the good aspects of the film as all remember is death which may have been an original motif but ends up being the focus instead of the characters ., went into this film thinking was n't going to like it but hoping to be surprised but this much like the film ended up being bleak and hopeless . but do n't get me wrong minghella delivers every bit of a grand epic and for those who enjoy that kind of experience and are willing to take that adventure and accept what comes as just that then they will not be disappointed and it will be one of the better films of the year in their opinion . the acting is of a high quality and will most likely come away with a trinity of oscar noms for law kidman and zellweger even though portman's few scenes may be the most powerful in the film . the locations are beautiful and minghella has an eye for a good shot . however for those like me who want the director to take them on the adventure instead of going willingly may come away disappointed mainly due to minghella and his adaptation . the film is so utterly bleak it makes for what consider to be a punching bag epic which is a film that that tries to hit hard with emotion but does so to such an extreme and so often that during the film did n't have the time to emotionally invest or had n't recovered from a previous blow and it became unrealistic and consequently too difficult to really care not to mention predictable . overall the cold mountain'' almost left me too drained to even think back on the good aspects of the film as all remember is death which may have been an original motif but ends up being the focus instead of the characters ., went into this film thinking was n going to like it but hoping to be surprised but this much like the film ended up being bleak and hopeless but do n get me wrong minghella delivers every bit of a grand epic and for those who enjoy that kind of experience and are willing to take that adventure and accept what comes as just that then they will not be disappointed and it will be one of the better films of the year in their opinion the acting is of a high quality and will most likely come away with a trinity of oscar noms for law kidman and zellweger even though portman s few scenes may be the most powerful in the film the locations are beautiful and minghella has an eye for a good shot however for those like me who want the director to take them on the adventure instead of going willingly may come away disappointed mainly due to minghella and his adaptation the film is so utterly bleak it makes for what consider to be a punching bag epic which is a film that that tries to hit hard with emotion but does so to such an extreme and so often that during the film did n have the time to emotionally invest or had n recovered from a previous blow and it became unrealistic and consequently too difficult to really care not to mention predictable overall the cold mountain almost left me too drained to even think back on the good aspects of the film as all remember is death which may have been an original motif but ends up being the focus instead of the characters, bleak hopeless wrong grand willing better high likely portman s few powerful beautiful good disappointed due utterly hard previous unrealistic difficult predictable overall good original, went into this film thinking wa n going to like it but hoping to be surprised but this much like the film ended up being bleak and hopeless but do n get me wrong minghella delivers every bit of a grand epic and for those who enjoy that kind of experience and are willing to take that adventure and accept what come a just that then they will not be disappointed and it will be one of the better film of the year in their opinion the acting is of a high quality and will most likely come away with a trinity of oscar noms for law kidman and zellweger even though portman s few scene may be the most powerful in the film the location are beautiful and minghella ha an eye for a good shot however for those like me who want the director to take them on the adventure instead of going willingly may come away disappointed mainly due to minghella and his adaptation the film is so utterly bleak it make for what consider to be a punching bag epic which is a film that that try to hit hard with emotion but doe so to such an extreme and so often that during the film did n have the time to emotionally invest or had n recovered from a previous blow and it became unrealistic and consequently too difficult to really care not to mention predictable overall the cold mountain almost left me too drained to even think back on the good aspect of the film a all remember is death which may have been an original motif but end up being the focus instead of the character
2987_8.txt,1, Most of these reviews are dead on so I'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions I've seen on here . While the characters seem and look young the controversy the actor themselves were and at the time and so obviously over the barrier . Here in the USA that's still somewhat controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film does much to offset it . I'm sorry not to have seen more by Sean in this movie at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious you know exactly what the character is feeling whether he's angry afraid or confused . Anicee had a healthy career who's life was cut unfortunately short by cancer in late She was a beautiful and talented actress . VHS tapes of FRIENDS can be found at Amazon . occasionally but usually for a significant price I've seen it as low as or so and as high as of this comment there were two for that price The sequel video PAUL MICHELLE is not quite as pricey and can be obtained available on Amazon for between and on average ., most of these reviews are dead on so i'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions i've seen on here . while the characters seem and look young the controversy the actor themselves were and at the time and so obviously over the barrier . here in the usa that's still somewhat controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film does much to offset it . i'm sorry not to have seen more by sean in this movie at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious you know exactly what the character is feeling whether he's angry afraid or confused . anicee had a healthy career who's life was cut unfortunately short by cancer in late she was a beautiful and talented actress . vhs tapes of friends can be found at amazon . occasionally but usually for a significant price i've seen it as low as or so and as high as of this comment there were two for that price the sequel video paul michelle is not quite as pricey and can be obtained available on amazon for between and on average ., most of these reviews are dead on so i ll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions i ve seen on here while the characters seem and look young the controversy the actor themselves were and at the time and so obviously over the barrier here in the usa that s still somewhat controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film does much to offset it i m sorry not to have seen more by sean in this movie at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious you know exactly what the character is feeling whether he s angry afraid or confused anicee had a healthy career who s life was cut unfortunately short by cancer in late she was a beautiful and talented actress vhs tapes of friends can be found at amazon occasionally but usually for a significant price i ve seen it as low as or so and as high as of this comment there were two for that price the sequel video paul michelle is not quite as pricey and can be obtained available on amazon for between and on average, most dead i different young controversial i sorry more least demonstrative obvious angry healthy short late beautiful talented amazon significant low high available, most of these review are dead on so i ll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of question i ve seen on here while the character seem and look young the controversy the actor themselves were and at the time and so obviously over the barrier here in the usa that s still somewhat controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film doe much to offset it i m sorry not to have seen more by sean in this movie at least his expression are demonstrative and obvious you know exactly what the character is feeling whether he s angry afraid or confused anicee had a healthy career who s life wa cut unfortunately short by cancer in late she wa a beautiful and talented actress vhs tape of friend can be found at amazon occasionally but usually for a significant price i ve seen it a low a or so and a high a of this comment there were two for that price the sequel video paul michelle is not quite a pricey and can be obtained available on amazon for between and on average
9924_8.txt,1, Dario Argento is a filmmaker I'm slowly getting into following the iconoclastic efforts of Deep Red and Suspiria he's not a filmmaker to always care directly about silly things like plot'' That might be his one minor for me apparent liability he wo n't let a little thing like common sense screw up his plan for his elaborate killing sequences as his killer can go through any kind of elaborate set of being invisible until revealing past the point of the POV tracking shots of said psychopathic killer . But it's thrilling to see a filmmaker take chances like this anyway of a pure Italian aesthetic making its way into the soul of a Hitchcockian warp fact as a note of interest if one has recently seen the Scorsese short film where he took three pages of an un Hitchcock film which also took place in an Opera Argento had it beat by almost twenty years probably with no knowledge of the text It's also unabashedly players and heavy metal and the hair oh my ! and with an absurdity that makes it all the more palatable to swallow . The story is simple an opera of Macbeth is being produced with high pyrotechnics and trained ravens . There's even a talented up star replaced at the last minute Betty played by Marsillach . But a murder occurs during the premiere interrupted not by that but by a falling light and now the killer is after Betty ! She ca n't go to the police can she let out that the opera is really cursed ? but will that matter in the face of a killer who wo n't let up ? One has probably seen premises like this played out in other Argento films girl being chased by a killer but it's how Argento like De Palma constructs and executes his sequences and adds a distinctive flavor of his own to add touches of bizarre humor breakout of the ravens to attack the killer and the subsequent version of pointing out in the lineup a kind of over ala Leone bullet through the peephole through the door probably inspired a similar shot in Kill Bill and even sado inspiration with the pins taped to Betty's eyes more than once ! Argento puts his actress through the wringer and she's all game for it even when things seem to just go into territory was throwing up my hands almost saying give up when she is led down the secret passage by the little girl as if suddenly we're in Aliens now And through such dark genre material Argento keeps the violence thick and fresh the suspense about as much as that with opera music coming right out of a speaker of a stereo system and a cinematographer who may have had a few drinks rightfully so ! during some scenes the way they're shot and vibrate to a heart It should be considered trash but it's elevated past any limitations of the genre by the ballsy attitude of the director this in spite of a silly ending sillier than anything that preceded what came before it little lizard

But tuning in with a friend from college found us both enjoying the pilot episode a lot more than we had expected . As a member of a Greek society can say that a lot of the stereotypes that are brought up here are ones that come up almost every time someone starts talking about the sororities and fraternities on a campus .

The opening scene harkened to an only version of preparing for an actual formal rush in some sororities and it continued on from there . This is n't a show for over Greeks .

Read only if you watch trailers or if you've already seen it The Emily Watson character cheats on the Tom Wilkonson character . My first reaction to the puppy Emily was It's Over . Dump her .

But he stuck by her and let her live her life . But still wanted to see her Afterwards Julian the screenwriter and director talked about the film . I'm glad he did because frankly am too you and was too immature to get the point before he broke it down for me .

You have to try and make things work because the alternative may be much worse . She needed what she needed and she could n't help that . He had to learn to let go of her if he wanted to be the full man he could be . He helped her in pursuit of her lover even when it hurt him .

He felt a need to let her know that he loved her but not to in order to get her back he wanted to let her know she did n't need to feel guilty or think poorly about the relationship just because it ended in such a terrible way . It is not my way to review a film based on the message rather than the execution especially when understand that message better when it is explained to me by the director but make an exception here as feel one more mature than would benefit from seeing the film .

3015_7.txt,1, went straight to the big screen to view this kicker . This is the only flick that know of that Tarsem Singh has directed but boy was it intense . This movie was a total mind stimulant and one of the best special effects flick of this kind . The characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare .

5696_9.txt,1, While many people found this film simply too slow and simplistic really connected with it . There is no plot as such rather the film takes the form of a human survival story about three people trapped up a tree with a man eating crocodile lurking somewhere in the water beneath them . Personally thought the acting was mostly very good despite the roles being quite demanding at times and felt a sense of warmth for the characters . The situation they were in was quite terrifying and really felt nervous for them . found the whole film quite nerve wracking because of the sheer helplessness of their situation and the constant threat to their survival . The crocodile effects were handled surprisingly well for such a low budget film and believe me have seen my fair share of dodgy croc movies . The creature moved well and had real menace and although the audience was with did n't seem too keen on the film as a whole they still jumped and gasped whenever the crocodile appeared . Script would have made a few changes particularly towards the end but this was not a major problem . For fans of slow survival horror set within the realms of reality this will be an engaging film but unfortunately think for many audiences seeking a thrill ride and higher production values from their cinema experience the point will simply be missed ., while many people found this film simply too slow and simplistic really connected with it . there is no plot as such rather the film takes the form of a human survival story about three people trapped up a tree with a man eating crocodile lurking somewhere in the water beneath them . personally thought the acting was mostly very good despite the roles being quite demanding at times and felt a sense of warmth for the characters . the situation they were in was quite terrifying and really felt nervous for them . found the whole film quite nerve wracking because of the sheer helplessness of their situation and the constant threat to their survival . the crocodile effects were handled surprisingly well for such a low budget film and believe me have seen my fair share of dodgy croc movies . the creature moved well and had real menace and although the audience was with did n't seem too keen on the film as a whole they still jumped and gasped whenever the crocodile appeared . script would have made a few changes particularly towards the end but this was not a major problem . for fans of slow survival horror set within the realms of reality this will be an engaging film but unfortunately think for many audiences seeking a thrill ride and higher production values from their cinema experience the point will simply be missed ., while many people found this film simply too slow and simplistic really connected with it there is no plot as such rather the film takes the form of a human survival story about three people trapped up a tree with a man eating crocodile lurking somewhere in the water beneath them personally thought the acting was mostly very good despite the roles being quite demanding at times and felt a sense of warmth for the characters the situation they were in was quite terrifying and really felt nervous for them found the whole film quite nerve wracking because of the sheer helplessness of their situation and the constant threat to their survival the crocodile effects were handled surprisingly well for such a low budget film and believe me have seen my fair share of dodgy croc movies the creature moved well and had real menace and although the audience was with did n seem too keen on the film as a whole they still jumped and gasped whenever the crocodile appeared script would have made a few changes particularly towards the end but this was not a major problem for fans of slow survival horror set within the realms of reality this will be an engaging film but unfortunately think for many audiences seeking a thrill ride and higher production values from their cinema experience the point will simply be missed, many slow simplistic such human crocodile good terrifying nervous whole constant low fair real n keen few major slow engaging many higher, while many people found this film simply too slow and simplistic really connected with it there is no plot a such rather the film take the form of a human survival story about three people trapped up a tree with a man eating crocodile lurking somewhere in the water beneath them personally thought the acting wa mostly very good despite the role being quite demanding at time and felt a sense of warmth for the character the situation they were in wa quite terrifying and really felt nervous for them found the whole film quite nerve wracking because of the sheer helplessness of their situation and the constant threat to their survival the crocodile effect were handled surprisingly well for such a low budget film and believe me have seen my fair share of dodgy croc movie the creature moved well and had real menace and although the audience wa with did n seem too keen on the film a a whole they still jumped and gasped whenever the crocodile appeared script would have made a few change particularly towards the end but this wa not a major problem for fan of slow survival horror set within the realm of reality this will be an engaging film but unfortunately think for many audience seeking a thrill ride and higher production value from their cinema experience the point will simply be missed

6348_8.txt,1, Let me say first off that am a huge fan of the original series Lonesome Dove and the book it was based from . have put off watching this sequel for the better part of years due to the bad reviews I'd heard about it . If Tommy Lee Jones was n't playing Capt . Call did n't see the point . If Larry McMurtry was n't involved why should care ? How wrong was . This is in so many ways a worthy sequel to Lonesome Dove maybe even more so than the dark mood of Streets Of Laredo . The story acting production cinematography are all top Of course the script is n't as colorful as Lonesome Dove but it has it's moments . And much to my surprise there are bits of Lonesome Done in this series the relationship between July and Clara completely dismissed in the prequel is brought up here almost identical to the book a most welcome surprise . The story is n't all roses it has it's surprises too . By far the biggest surprise is Jon Voight's interpretation of Capt . Call . While not a direct copy of Tommy Lee Jones his is both faithful and unique to Voight's credit . The cast is fantastic all across the board and do n't think Rick Schroeder has done a better job of acting than in this series . Oliver Reed practically steals the show here he is superb in a role that makes you care for his character as equally as you hate him . It is worth it to watch this if you have n't due to bad criticisms especially that the DVD is so affordable got the set for you can probably find it cheaper It is in no way the disappointment that Dead Man's Walk turned out it was for me And MCMurtry was involved with that one !, let me say first off that am a huge fan of the original series lonesome dove and the book it was based from . have put off watching this sequel for the better part of years due to the bad reviews i'd heard about it . if tommy lee jones was n't playing capt . call did n't see the point . if larry mcmurtry was n't involved why should care ?

Ramona is based on the children's books by Beverly Cleary and follows the adventures of the title eight Polley She has fun with friends and family and gets into trouble much like many eight All ten episodes are pretty good . Mystery Meal'' kind of grosses me out as a vegan but it's funny seeing the parents trying to get their kids to eat cow's tongue ! And any episode that mentions Godzilla Versus The Smog Monster twice ca n't be all bad . like Ramona's Bad Day'' even more . Although it's disheartening to see Ramona going through a rough day she does imagine herself getting revenge on her friend Howie's uncle pre Factor Barclay Hope who always teases her . The Perfect Day'' is also good . Lori Chodos plays Beezus Ramona's sister . swear I've seen her on something else but IMDb does n't list anything besides this show .

8077_7.txt,1, So forgive the lame game scene cardboard background and studio like stadium . For this part should have give the movie instead of but read on . From the premise to plot there is a lot similarities with The Replacements'' Some say this movie rip off The Replacements'' while some say this script wrote before it . Both movies require some sort of suspension of disbelief on the basic premise and this is especially difficult for Second String'' since it has NFL license team and all the history behind it . Food poison excuse may sound too lame for some people and not to mention in Second String'' Bills has to overcome big scores again and again with the limit budget in shooting the game play scene this make it look even bad . In Replacements'' the premise and the league is fictional yet you know it happen in real life . believe it is easier to accept fictional story and setting with real event yeah this happen before ! rather than real setting with fictional scenario is no way Bill can win a Superbowl ! Some of the scene were actually shoot in pre season game of Raven games real stadium real audience and some NFL match alike shooting angle . But let say both movies came out on the same day and we erase the budget factor forgive the game play action scene Overall like Second String'' over Replacements'' not by much but like this more . It has relatively better'' character development . In Replacements'' Keanu character is too out sync with the world'' and all he care is maybe get a girl ? In Second String you see the struggle of the QB from getting the job back and deal with his past with coach . Or the fumble guy problem . This hold the ball all day long'' solution of course is not new but we see progression in fixing it . How about those trick play ? think it is relatively realistic'' than Replacements'' The Dan Marino'' like fake knee pass flea wild cat full back rush all real except sometimes this look a bit too easy .

6936_9.txt,1, OK got the DVD set last week and am finally getting around to posting my reviews but sure liked this sequel in many ways . Zombie Bloodbath Rage of the Undead . OK . This one movies at a fast clip has some really good gore effects and some really well done atmosphere and style . would actually go on record as saying this may be one of the most stylish DV shot flicks that have bought . Most of the time get rather angry at DV movies for being boring and looking like soap operas . Even a movie like Bone Sickness that like has incredible stretches of DULL . Not this movie . It never stops long enough to let you catch your breath . Although would n't say liked it better than the first film will say that Sheets certainly improved technically in the two years in between films . This one has better gore the inevitable zombie feeding scenes scumbag characters and a few returning actors their roles are different mainly Jerry Angell as a pretty good psychopath with a killer mullet from hell . The shots are more ambitious as well as the script this time around because you can tell Sheets is trying to pull a lot more off than he did in the first film . Some of it works and some of it does n't but have to say that at least he was n't just trying to do a larger version of the first film . There was no mention this time around of a power plant of chemical spillage just Satanism and the occult that brings the undead back to life . So say kudos to Mr . Sheets for trying to do something different with this one . give this film two bloody thumbs up !, ok got the dvd set last week and am finally getting around to posting my reviews but sure liked this sequel in many ways . zombie bloodbath rage of the undead . ok . this one movies at a fast clip has some really good gore effects and some really well done atmosphere and style . would actually go on record as saying this may be one of the most stylish dv shot flicks that have bought . most of the time get rather angry at dv movies for being boring and looking like soap operas . even a movie like bone sickness that like has incredible stretches of dull . not this movie . it never stops long enough to let you catch your breath . although would n't say liked it better than the first film will say that sheets certainly improved technically in the two years in between films . this one has better gore the inevitable zombie feeding scenes scumbag characters and a few returning actors their roles are different mainly jerry angell as a pretty good psychopath with a killer mullet from hell . the shots are more ambitious as well as the script this time around because you can tell sheets is trying to pull a lot more off than he did in the first film . some of it works and some of it does n't but have to say that at least he was n't just trying to do a larger version of the first film . there was no mention this time around of a power plant of chemical spillage just satanism and the occult that brings the undead back to life . so say kudos to mr . sheets for trying to do something different with this one . give this film two bloody thumbs up !, ok got the dvd set last week and am finally getting around to posting my reviews but sure liked this sequel in many ways zombie bloodbath rage of the undead ok this one movies at a fast clip has some really good gore effects and some really well done atmosphere and style would actually go on record as saying this may be one of the most stylish dv shot flicks that have bought most of the time get rather angry at dv movies for being boring and looking like soap operas even a movie like bone sickness that like has incredible stretches of dull not this movie it never stops long enough to let you catch your breath although would n say liked it better than the first film will say that sheets certainly improved technically in the two years in between films this one has better gore the inevitable zombie feeding scenes scumbag characters and a few returning actors their roles are different mainly jerry angell as a pretty good psychopath with a killer mullet from hell the shots are more ambitious as well as the script this time around because you can tell sheets is trying to pull a lot more off than he did in the first film some of it works and some of it does n but have to say that at least he was n just trying to do a larger version of the first film there was no mention this time around of a power plant of chemical spillage just satanism and the occult that brings the undead back to life so say kudos to mr sheets for trying to do something different with this one give this film two bloody thumbs up, last sure many bloodbath undead fast good stylish most angry dv boring incredible better first better inevitable scumbag few different good ambitious more first least larger first chemical undead say different, ok got the dvd set last week and am finally getting around to posting my review but sure liked this sequel in many way zombie bloodbath rage of the undead ok this one movie at a fast clip ha some really good gore effect and some really well done atmosphere and style would actually go on record a saying this may be one of the most stylish dv shot flick that have bought most of the time get rather angry at dv movie for being boring and looking like soap opera even a movie like bone sickness that like ha incredible stretch of dull not this movie it never stop long enough to let you catch your breath although would n say liked it better than the first film will say that sheet certainly improved technically in the two year in between film this one ha better gore the inevitable zombie feeding scene scumbag character and a few returning actor their role are different mainly jerry angell a a pretty good psychopath with a killer mullet from hell the shot are more ambitious a well a the script this time around because you can tell sheet is trying to pull a lot more off than he did in the first film some of it work and some of it doe n but have to say that at least he wa n just trying to do a larger version of the first film there wa no mention this time around of a power plant of chemical spillage just satanism and the occult that brings the undead back to life so say kudos to mr sheet for trying to do something different with this one give this film two bloody thumb up
7893_8.txt,1, If Archie Bunker was armed he may well have been Joe'' However All in the Family'' would have had a rather short run because the censors would never have allowed it to run along the lines of THIS movie . Joe is a working class guy who is a racist and a bigot and has a big mouth especially when he's drunk . One night he meets a man in a bar Bill who is having a drink to soothe his frazzled nerves after accidentally killing his daughter's junkie boyfriend and he lets that slip to Joe . What happens is that Bill's daughter was living with the junkie and she's hauled off to the hospital after an overdose and he goes by the apartment to collect her things but does n't expect that he'll actually run into the boyfriend who comes in fresh from a big drug deal . In the struggle that ensues the boyfriend is killed accidentally and Bill does n't want anyone really to know of course . But he lets it slip to Joe and then when the newspapers and TV reports come out Joe sees them puts and together and suddenly this man is a hero in his eyes . He hooks up with him later and Bill is of course concerned that Joe is going to blackmail him but not for money he wants to hang out with him . Which is in a way almost worse . Now Bill's daughter escapes from the clinic she's in and slips back home and accidentally overhears what happened and then is on the run and most of the rest of the movie consists of Joe Bill infiltrating the underground'' to try to find her . This builds up to a rather shocking ending which to me was totally unexpected and ends on just the right note or wrong note depending on your point of view . sort of decent but dim view of life in the early mostly from a working class bigot's point of view which makes it not for everyone but it's not a bad film at all and it's a decent watch . out of, if archie bunker was armed he may well have

9948_7.txt,1, If you love Japanese monster movies you'll love this action packed battle pitting an alien invader intent upon conquering the Earth and a Giant Robot'' with an armory of super weaponry . The alien Emporer Guillotine from the planet Gargoyle has a army of thugs called course the gargoyle gang as well as an endless supply of immense hostile creatures that are routinely loosed upon the Earth to smash buildings make loud noises panic the populace etc . little kid named Johnny Sokko has the Giant Robot at his beckon call and sends the Robot as needed to beat up and then blast these creatures . Johnny joins a group of good spies'' called Unicorn and endeavors to help save the world . In spite of the campy nature unintentionally humorous dialog and the fact that the target audience was obviously children this movie has non action colorful characters decent special effects and just happens to be downright fun to watch . Battle scenes are well executed and frequent as the storyline requires . The good guys and bad guys both made sure they had an inexhaustible supply of bombs lasers ammunition and schemes to attack each other . In spite of the fact the movie was constructed from edited episodes of a TV series the plot actually develops and reaches an ultimate conclusion . The film has a positive outlook and appeals to everyone's kids desire to destroy evil in its many forms . Kids may be the target audience but it's fun for everyone to laugh at its comical silliness yet at the same time root for the good guys to prevail and save the world . The acting is cheesy in places but that is the charm there are several lines of corny dialog translation errors or possibly intentional jokes by the movie makers and you'll find yourself quoting these absurd lines later .

1989_8.txt,1, eXistenZ is an exploration of reality and virtual reality wherein characters run from realm to realm landscape to landscape trying to beat a game they know not the goal of or exactly where it's leading them . Within that virtual reality game is more layers of virtual reality games calling into question which reality they arrive from is the real'' one . Of course it's not spectacular at hiding the fact that it's not going to reasonably answer to a true reality instead tossing the idea of whether it's real or a video game into question even up to the end . I'm not even sure Cronenberg pretends that twist wo n't be there it's so incredibly obvious in a sense it's kind of disconcerting . The problem with this film though is its base nature in a sense . Cronenberg is questioning reality AND criticizing game play . Yet the same things that he uses to criticize game play makes him revel in it the violence the discontinuity the lack of focus and in a sense the pixellation even if there is n't such pixellation in the film . have once heard someone state that Cronenberg's violence is actually a criticism of hyperviolence in media but he hides that well with the fact that he derives such incredible pleasure in ripping new orifices into humans animals and amorphous piles of biological sludge . What IS brilliantly written and done about this movie is the use of video game conceits being able to say exactly what you want to say during cut scenes relative lack of surroundings or surroundings that do n't make sense only a few people around where it feels there should be many and vice all of that stuff along with the motif of penetration . It definitely deconstructs the video game reality in a way that's nauseating and absurd but it does it even better by replacing video game electronics with literal pods'' of biological matter that squirm and shift and are frankly disgusting to the one of the most horrifying degrees . For what it's worth this film causes a reaction in you . But what for ? It criticizes virtual reality but it's a movie it is its own virtual reality . It seems to criticize the banality of video game plot lines and character design yet it maintains that banality . It definitely seems to worry over whether killing a video game character is more okay than killing an actual human being and how video games can be confused with reality and cause people to not think about the consequences of their actions in real life and yet say again it derives the utmost pleasure from ripping people objects beasts things and organisms into bloody shreds . So whereas it has a key focus of angst it does n't really do anything with it not really . Only what it does do is present that angst in such an original way it ca n't really be denied its own moment of splendor . In a sense it'd be much easier to just hate this movie for being gory and violent because there's no good reason can see for loving it and yet ca n't disregard it as mediocre or bad . It'd be easier to simply not be able to take it but since can there's nothing can really do with it . do believe it is a little excessive it really did n't need to go as far as it went but Cronenberg's intentions are so mixed up and confused do n't know if that was Cronenberg's flaw or Cronenberg's point and do n't think there's really any way to figure it out except maybe ask him

the fact that it s not going to reasonably answer to a true reality instead tossing the idea of whether it s real or a video game into question even up to the end i m not even sure cronenberg pretends that twist wo n be there it s so incredibly obvious in a sense it s kind of disconcerting the problem with this film though is its base nature in a sense cronenberg is questioning reality and criticizing game play yet the same things that he uses to criticize game play makes him revel in it the violence the discontinuity the lack of focus and in a sense the pixellation even if there is n such pixellation in the film have once heard someone state that cronenberg s violence is actually a criticism of hyperviolence in media but he hides that well with the fact that he derives such incredible pleasure in ripping new orifices into humans animals and amorphous piles of biological sludge what is brilliantly written and done about this movie is the use of video game conceits being able to say exactly what you want to say during cut scenes relative lack of surroundings or surroundings that do n make sense only a few people around where it feels there should be many and vice all of that stuff along with the motif of penetration it definitely deconstructs the video game reality in a way that s nauseating and absurd but it does it even better by replacing video game electronics with literal pods of biological matter that squirm and shift and are frankly disgusting to the one of the most horrifying degrees for what it s worth this film causes a reaction in you but what for it criticizes virtual reality but it s a movie it is its own virtual reality it seems to criticize the banality of video game plot lines and character design yet it maintains that banality it definitely seems to worry over whether killing a video game character is more okay than killing an actual human being and how video games can be confused with reality and cause people to not think about the consequences of their actions in real life and yet say again it derives the utmost pleasure from ripping people objects beasts things and organisms into bloody shreds so whereas it has a key focus of angst it does n really do anything with it not really only what it does do is present that angst in such an original way it ca n really be denied its own moment of splendor in a sense it d be much easier to just hate this movie for being gory and violent because there s no good reason can see for loving it and yet ca n disregard it as mediocre or bad it d be easier to simply not be able to take

First people just have to get over the fact that the voices are different . Once you watch an episode it never really comes to mind ever again . The humor is original and while yes some jokes do carry over from the movie they are delivered fresh . Some of it is even reminiscent of Shrek humor . lot of these jokes seem aimed at teens or original fans of the movie as much as tweens and younger . Patrick Warburton and Eartha Kitt are both hilarious as they reprise their roles as Kronk and Yzma and their Annie Award nominations were well This show takes some time to love to really get in the groove'' of things so to speak .

1554_8.txt,1, too saw this film at a film festival but unlike the previous poster found it both interesting and original .

1421_10.txt,1, WARNING MAY contain some minor spoilers . Hard to say anything bad about this movie except for one thing . YOU DO N'T GET TO SEE IT MUCH ANYMORE Then again maybe that's because you have to be home in the morning or at am to catch it the Fox Movie channel . Too bad for this is another gem lost to time Clifton Webb takes his patented sour know demeanor he had perfected as Lynn Belvedere Pretty'' and sequels and turns Boy Actually it's like this . Webb plays Robert Jordan the host of a Sunday children's educational program that is losing audience share and the network breaks it to him that he needs to do something about it or else . Part of the problem may be due to the fact that the married host has no children . BUMMER But as such things happen the local church pastor needs a leader for an unruly troop of Boy Scouts and finds a willing victim ahhhh in the host so Jordan he takes the position . Problem solved RIGHT WRONG This being a movie there are other problems . For example it turns out one of the Scouts is the son of his boss at the TV station which causes a little friction especially since the kid is overweight has asthma as well as an attitude . And he is the more reasonable one . Also there is this Cub Scout Mike Winslow who wants to hang around being the puppy type . As it turns out the reason is that he has no folks of his own but is cared for by a relative who has n't much time for him . It is things like this that makes his job harder than expected . All in all Webb becomes more understanding of kids and not only saves his show but learns a rewarding lesson and eventually even adopts Mike .

Barry Gray's excellent music unique to this film adds to the feeling of familiarity . For these reasons alone think any Gerry Anderson fan would find Doppelg worth getting . Judged simply as a film it has to be said that Doppelg is flawed . It is known that there were major problems during production and suspect this is why there is a time plot thread that ends abruptly and appears to have no relevance to the rest of the story . Presumably time constraints prevented the relevance from emerging ! Distractingly the special effects range from outstandingly good better than any film that know of to disappointingly bad . Nevertheless even with these flaws Doppelg main story is well told and keeps the viewer at least this viewer engaged throughout .

perhaps an aloof attitude on the part of a good looking woman is just too much to bear it sank ali mcgraw s career a generation later and when you think of it ali mcgraw and suzy parker were basically the same actress the film s only major flaw is a weak ending it pretty much collapse into a romantic swoon at the end rather than rising to a wham bang melodramatic finish like the other famous soap opera from producer jerry wald peyton place which had lana turner weeping and gnashing her teeth during a rape trial here hope lange wanders out onto the new york sidewalk spot burly eternally hung over now of course sober stephen boyd and they simply walk off together the sunset one presumes otherwise this is pretty much the definition of a guilty pleasure oh yes also joan crawford breathing fire at all the young girl and smoking cigarette while she hiss to her married lover over the phone and the title are done in hot pink with ribbon lettering that recall the department store ad of the late do n miss

Though Bugs proves he's the smartest once more by repeatedly using reverse psychology on Daffy in increasingly subtle ways . And when that runs out he does his trademark cross thingy . Daffy freaks out and demands the bunny be shot . Though Elmer is too stupid he is hopelessly in love with the girl bunny thing . Elmer really is to blame for all this . If he were n't so dumb he'd know it REALLY is duck season and just blast Daffy . But poor old Daff ca n't believe the utter preposterousness of the situation . His cruel plans of misdirection have been foiled by Elmer's dumbness . Daffy is so shocked that he even goes home with Elmer to be blasted in his living room . Poor Daff .

My only major complaint is assumed Paris Hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc . and moan that's hot'' but they did n't do that could they resist ? There is NO nudity from the girls although Paris looks great in her lingerie ! I'm surprised they did n't put a hot token victim'' in the movie for some needless nudity which is the norm for this type of flick ! wo n't list any death or plot spoilers BUT will say that Paris Eliza both get roughed up good ! The characters are developed decently and are somewhat likable like Cabin Fever where you wanted them to die and the movie has a decent pace although nothing happens in the minutes like most horror films . give it a as it delivered good scares and gore and had low expectations going into it .

10503_8.txt,1, First let me review the movie . This movie creeps me out and do n't even believe in aliens ! However the movie has its flaws . There are three acts to this movie . Act One is perfect . It sets up the movie and really builds up the creep factor . must say the score is great ! Everything is set up and it's set up perfectly . Act Two begins when Jillian playing Sherry Burton goes to the shrink . They hypnotize her and she recalls the abduction . Act Two ruins the film when the aliens show up . Screaming Mad George'' did the effects for the aliens . must say they did a good job except with their depiction of the Gray'' aliens . No offense but the Grays looked like inflatable door prizes . On a side note liked how they treated hypnosis in Acts One and Two . If you paid attention you would notice that the husband and wife had two different memories . In the husband's version of events the blue light zaps them and his wife says Somebody's here or something like it . It makes sense . The husband is concerned for his wife . Someone'' may hurt her . That's his issue . However in her version of events she says Help me ! She does not say Somebody's here . This also makes sense . The aliens are after her . Wanting her husband to help and save her is her issue . Now back to the film . Act Three turns the film into a gore fest . It begins with a strange'' ultrasound procedure . It's a typical gore fest but it does have a surprise ending . wo n't ruin it because it's actually an interesting development . The DVD and commentaries takes itself too seriously but if you think Wilford Brimley saying Horsesh is funny you might want to check it out in the cast interviews section . Now on to my praise of Jillian McWhirter . could only hope Jillian will read this . had never seen her before but wow what a performance ! Let me tell the rest of you this . First of all this is supposed to be a serious film . The details will now describe may sound campy and fun like Humanoids From The Deep'' but it really is n't . Got that ? Okay . Jillian is hot naturally good She is naked for a lot of the film a good thing . Unfortunately she is usually being assaulted terrorized and raped a very bad thing . However she must act in a lot of this film naked . She gets points for overcoming that . She has to act happy sad horny afraid and physically hurt all in the span of a few moments . The turnaround of emotion is astounding ! She has to cheer for joy when she learns she's pregnant . She has to scream in terror when the aliens take out her guts . She has to act very angry when her husband suggests that the baby is n't his . She has to act like she's in denial saying nothing is wrong with her baby when her husband says otherwise . denial should note that is really forced upon her by the aliens controlling her . am talking Oscar performance here ! Then there is the rape scene . It's disturbing but since it's just some rubber alien it's not too bad . In this scene the alien is not a Gray'' alien so will describe it . The alien has tentacles and it's kind of like a table . Jillian is on the table part restrained by the tentacles . By her head is the alien's head . The alien's head is long and it flips down so that its head is now above Jillian's legs . Then the alien's hey comes out of his forehead . It's forehead ! Sounds pretty campy right ? Well Jillian plays it straight and she pulls it off ! She has to act like an alien with its hey coming from its forehead is raping her and she pulls it off ! It's a very intense scene but that's not what makes it . You see this scene is done in a flashback . What makes the scene is Jillian's performance recalling these events . She is just lying in a hospital bed under hypnosis recalling the alien abduction but her acting here is more intense than the actual rape scene ! How many actors can pull off a performance in a scene that describes a rape that is more intense than the scene with the rape ? Not many ! However Jillian does it . could go on and on . Jillian if you ever read this want you to know that withheld alias of MegamanX believe you are the best actress ever . You are the best actress ever ! could only hope you read this and take it with you always . As for everyone else Progeny'' is an Okay to Good film . would recommend it ., first let me review the movie . this movie creeps me out and do n't even believe in aliens ! however the movie has its

7478_10.txt,1, loved this film ! Fantastically original and different ! solid intense hard and suspenseful movie that has just the right touch of humor . If you're tired of the typical overdone ridiculous Hollywood movies how many big explosions and awful and unrealistic shoot em up gun fights that insult your intelligence can we take then this film is for you . Fantastic characters that are wonderfully original and believable and solid performances by all actors not a weak character or performance in the film . Skip Woods film is a breath of fresh air and applaud his originality and efforts his film has the feel of a cross between a Quentin Tarantino and a Cohen brothers film a bad mix at all in my opinion This movie grabs you by the throat and does n't let go there's nothing boring or bubble gum about this film . The only disappointment is that nobody seems to know about it everyone I've recommended it to has thanked me and shared my opinion on it .

1329_7.txt,1, Ocean's you steal fifty million dollars they will find you . Rickman as Hans Gruber Die Hard This adage certainly rings true in this sequel . Terry Benedict has been informed that Danny Ocean and his compadres were the ones who ripped him off and now he wants it all back . The Ocean gang need a lot of money and fast but can not work in the states as Benedict has made it impossible for them . So it's off to Europe to perform acts of death defying thievery whilst trying to avoid Catherine Zeta Jones super cop an old flame from Rusty's past . On their first heist in Amsterdam they find out that who ratted on them was the Fox a super slick thief with a legend complex . He issues them with a challenge that could write off their debt in full or land them in some kind of Uma Thurman Bill II Interesting ? Well yes . Slow ? Sort of . Entertaining ? Mostly . Unnecessary scenes of character development ? Plenty . Ocean and his band of merry men are charismatic if nothing else and as this is a sequel and we are all old friends we see plenty more situations and conversations . Too many . Damon's Linus is more nervous than before the cousins are bickering as we knew they would Bernie Mac talks too much and Don Cheadle's cock accent is as bad as ever really like Cheadle but could not abide this Pitt and Clooney talk like old friends filling each other's glasses and reading each other's minds . However what worked so well in the last film was the lack of character development versus how slick the whole damned op was . And as much as these actors work well together Zeta Jones fits into this film like a big square peg in a tight sided hole . She simply does n't fit and her chemistry with Pitt is non The stars of this film for me however were Vincent Cassel as the Night Fox and Soderbergh's choice of locations . Cassel plays pomp and wealth as if he was born into both . His Night Fox is arrogant cavalier with other people's lives Ocean and a total contrast to the Ocean gang . This is where think the film loses its way . Cassel and the European locations provide an all too realistic contrast with the American actors and the style of the first film . We want slick brash and quick not gritty considered and intellectual . This is where the film does n't work .

9442_8.txt,1, If you want to really terrify people choose the Devil as your subject . After all a good deal of the population believe that he is real . Therefore you are plugging into a whole meaty swathe of pre religious and mythological imagery . And bound to cause quite a few nightmares in your young audience . This episode had all the appearance of a Hollywood blockbuster . In fact having finished watching it flicked over to another channel which was playing a recent Bond film and quite frankly could n't split a hair between the differences in SFX . With a minimal cast restricted by its situation on a space station complete with overwhelming panoramic views of an imploding universe it was as claustrophobic and intense as Alien or Event Horison . The black hole outside made it feel as if the black hole's weight of dark matter was pressing the station onto the planet and to Whatever was sealed inside . And as the horror is intensified by the knowledge that the Dr and Rose are stranded the sinister Ood start channelling a disembodied voice and then the characters start being picked off one by one . This has all the best qualities of the cream of this new Dr Who endeavour Girl in the Fireplace and the Empty Child . Emotionally engaging frightening and humorous all without seeming cheesy . This is far scarier than any amount of flying Daleks . But it has to be asked is this really suitable viewing for children ? This is not a family friendly episode . Pity the poor parent who has to put their kids to bed after this one .

1646_7.txt,1, This is n't a bad TV movie . Shtrafbat is short for Shtrafnoy Batallion which means Penal Batallion . Such battallions were formed due to the increasing demand for soldiers as the Soviet Union was taking heavy casualties all through out the war . These battalions consisted of convicts and dishonored soldiers who were given the chance to clear their names by proving themselves in combat . They were looked down upon as scum and were expended easily during combat without much regret or much honor on the part of military . They were often sent on suicide missions and suffered extreme casualties . The ones who refused to fight were executed on sight . Needless to say their lives sucked . There were some very nice performances by the cast especially by Yuri Stepanov who played Antip Aleksandr Bashirov who played Stirah and Roman Madyanov who played Major Kharchenko . However the series is n't really that addictive in part because it's too long it could've a lot shorter and as effective . Although it's about war Shtrafbat has very mild violence and pretty much no gore . It relies solely on the actors to make it work and after all it's a TV series so the producers did n't want to scare off the viewers and the sponsors . Shtrafbat explores the cruelty of the Soviet regime and explaines why so many men chose to fight the Nazis instead of joining them . Personally I'd rather be a Fascist then a Communist given the circumstances presented in the film . One character explains that the Soviets stripped his farm clean and his family died of starvation . Out of anger he burned it down which got him arrested for destroying Kolhoz property and he ended up in the penal battalion as a criminal . Antip reminisced on how his mother killed her youngest son to feed the rest of the family . Both men explained that they fought for their motherland rather than the for the Soviets . The penal battalion had one Marine Infantry who raped a girl killing his comrade in the prosess threatened his other comrade to keep his mouth shut about both ordeals and then feigned injury when it came to fighting . On top of all that the girl committed suicide due to shame . imagine if enough Marines watched this movie they'd pick up banners and riot on the streets calling for a boycott or an official apology from the producers . To say the least I'd recommend it to anyone with the slightest interest in the former Soviet Union or World War II . do n't think wasted minutes of my life ., this is n't a bad tv movie . shtrafbat is

1675_9.txt,1, Or vice This is a French film noir directed by an American film maker Dassin who had to leave the country because of being blacklisted by Hollywood thanks to HUAC . The premise of the story is rather familiar last jewel heist for Tony le Stephanois and his buds so is the ending with everybody getting . Well no spoilers here for sure since this is the sort of film in which tension toward the ending is important . Dassin filmed in realistic lighting in black and white on the streets of Paris using actors and actresses who are not glamorous . The engaging intruding by Georges Auric nicely enhances the movie and will remind viewers of many a similar score from American film noirs from the forties and early fifties . Jean Servais plays the hardcore consumptive lead in a fedora much as Humphrey Bogart might have played him . Tony's recently out of prison past his prime but still tough and decisive when he has to be his mind still sharp when focused the kind of anti whose eyes water even though the tears will never fall . Dassin plays the Italian safecracker and would ladies man who knows the rules but gets careless . In film noir we are forced by the logic and focus of the film to identify with the bad guys . Often there are levels of bad guys the good'' bad guys we are identifying with and the bad'' bad guys who are out to do in our good bad guys and then maybe there's a really bad bad bad guy or two . we have Remi Grutter played by Robert Hossein a slightly sadistic druggie . Then there are the cops who are irrelevant or nearly so . In more modern film noir the bad guys are not even good'' bad guys and they get away with it or something close to that . In the old film noir which evolved from the gangster films of the thirties the usual motto following the old Hollywood code was Crime Does n't Pay with every criminal having to pay for his or her crime before the end of the movie . Probably the most impressive feature of Rififi is how nicely the film moves along . The plot unfolds quickly and seamlessly much the way the great film directors always did it directors like Stanley Kubrick Louis Malle and the best of Hitchcock . Some have actually compared this to Kubrick's The Killing and suggest that Kubrick stole a little . Well directors always steal if need be and there are some perhaps telling similarities such as it being one last heist'' for the protagonist and having the girl gum up the works . The similarities may go deeper because as this film was nearing its end suddenly thought oh no ! the suitcase in the back seat is going to fly out of the convertible hit the ground burst open and all the money is going to fly into the air ! Those of you who have seen The Killing may recall what happened to the money near the end of the film ! Which reminds me of another film with something bad happening to the money Oliver Stone's Turn starring Sean Penn . There the money in his backpack gets blown to smithereens by a shotgun blast . Ha ha ha ! Getting the dubbed version of this film would be an act of sacrilege since the dialogue there is some the heist itself is done entirely without dialogue about minutes worth is terse and easy to follow requiring only an occasional glance at the subtitles which by the way are quite utilitarian and guiding as opposed to having every word spelled out . One other thing all the brutality is done as sex used to be done in film that is off camera . guy gets his throat slit . We do n't see it . kind of like this approach . We do n't have to see the gore .

The studio made drastic cuts to the film cutting a good or so minutes out of it and they did a HORRIBLE job promoting it .

9957_10.txt,1, There were at least a half dozen silent versions of Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice and there have been several television productions . But no one has ever gotten around to making a big theatrical feature from the play until now . Given the nature of the play most memorable character Shylock the Nasty Jew it's a good guess that the little unpleasantness that transpired in Europe in the late and may have dampened filmmakers enthusiasm . Sure the main motivation for Michael Radford's new film is to provide Al Pacino with a chance to shout bray brood mutter and be tormented all of which he is quite good at . Like Richard III the role of Shylock is a scenery dream . It is ridiculous to call Shakespeare an anti since he never met a Jew . Jews were banned from England from years before his time to some decades after his death and its unlikely that he ever traveled abroad . On some level Jews might as well have been a mythological race to him . But while Shakespeare may not have been anti his play certainly is . Pacino gives Shylock a strange accent that is probably meant to suggest the slightest hint of Yiddish . Unfortunately the result is a moneylender with the unmistakable diction and cadences of Fozzie Bear . Radford's version begins with a crawl about the wretched teratment of Jews and then spot Antonio Irons gratuitiously spitting on Shylock who's really just standing around minding his own business .

673_8.txt,1, particularly enjoyed Delly's review of this film and agree that Howard is not the only damaged'' character . Howard is rather ruthlessly set by the script but there is no evidence that his previous employer is actually dead or if she is that he murdered her . Howard does n't know and neither do we . In terror and confusion at seeing the woman lying there he bolts . However he never actually harms Helen Gordon no matter how enraged he is . Indeed he reacts with horror at Helen's fainting spell and the fact that he is holding a pair of scissors . he resumes his tidying up and greets the recovered Helen with the almost pathetic I'm very tired now . think I'll go home'' Frankly do n't think he's a psychopath . sick puppy certainly but not a psychopath . The problem with Howard is that he has no real male identity . He wanted to serve his country but his mental condition denies him a place in the army . He is singularly rootless and isolated no wife no girl no home at least as far as we know And he does a woman's job Floor's are my speciality'' Helen's niece ruthlessly strips away this pride in his thoroughness by exclaiming caustically that she would want a man with a real job . Also although he finds himself strongly attracted to Helen he is unable or unwilling to do more than scare her by making a strong sexual pass . He is remarkably powerless ca n't fight ca n't work ca n't make love . Helen is justifiably terrified however .

If you think about it its not an easy subject matter to handle but this film manages to suspend disbelief which in itself is a feat for such a way out subject . Casting the main character as a doctor was a sensible move which lends credence to his willingness to believe in the possibility of alien abduction . Vosloo plays it very sensitively involving us in his pain and confusion at the weird events that befall himself and his wife . Special Effects are used sparingly but to shocking effect and at times the movie is totally gripping but sadly there are a couple of points where the plot wanders and leaves some confusion . Also after building to a tense climax the ending is something of a let down . The supporting characters were unnecessarily weak alien hunter or menacing psychiatrist which also served to detract .

102_8.txt,1, Although Bullet In The Brain is without question superior amongst short films it largely seems more like a short piece of writing than a film . And it is a little hard to feel too sorry for the teacher when his smart ass remarks get him shot . But after the bullet enters his brain we begin to understand a little bit about why he became so jaded with life in the first place . There is an awful amount of detail packed into this reasonably short film and this is what makes me feel that it should have been extended a little bit it seems like there's almost too much to take in at once as the details come flying at you so fast . slightly more relaxed pace and a less po narrator in the final section would have benefitted this film a little bit . Despite these complaints there is no denying that Bullet In The Brain is a quite stupendous work compared to many short and even full length films .

4032_8.txt,1, For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something and who appreciate a farce that is clever enough for you to take it seriously this movie will surprise you . It is not a for people who ca n't are n't able to follow the verbal exchange of our hero Professor Dexter Cornell Quaid Cornell teaches in Southern California near the tar pits . He has not published a novel in four years his wife is divorcing him he drinks a bit much and is blessed or cursed with caustic wit which he freely dispenses to his students . He has recommended a friend for advancement and one bright young student has submitted a manuscript to him as an independent project .

Leaning back with a drink in his office he stares out the window when the bright young student falls past his window on the way to meeting the sidewalk in a splat encounter . Hal comes to talk and they chat drinking some more . The Cornell realizes that he HAS to read the manuscript now . When he goes home his wife is waiting with divorce papers . He drinks some more . She leaves and he goes to a faculty affair only to find her there . He drinks even more . And when his wife learns that the student is dead she swoons and he learns that she had been having an affair with the student . This of course prompts him to do some more serious drinking . The next morning he wakes up to find himself in the dorm room of one of his students a freshman named Syd Ryan He feels worse than a hangover goes to the doctor and learns that he has been poisoned it is irreversible and he has hours to live . He does n't have much time to find out who killed him and there are sub motives relationships and surprises at every turn although everything makes sense at the end . All his discoveries and exchanges are adorned with sarcasm dry wit and keen observations . Let's just say that this movie will give new meaning to the adage publish or perish'' There are no bad performances in this movie . There are recurrent images and symbolism used at careful intervals . Watch for the cracked glass and images distorted through glass . Some of the camera shots are revolutionary for and some of the violent action is carefully and skillfully choreographed . The music is unobtrusive and appropriate although occasionally it makes it's own statement in song lyrics . The visuals in this flick are impressive . If there are any failures it is that the opening minutes move a little slow and nearly puts you to sleep . But the pacing picks up quickly with just the right amount of exposition in between action segments . There are no explicit sexual encounters although there is violence and some bad language .

So what is the attraction here ? think that for me it's the offbeatness of the romance . find it super refreshing to have an oddball coupling between this NYC Jimmy columnist and a down ballerina . You feel embarrassed for Paul Sorvino at his unsubtle approach to wooing this woman . Like the guy in the bar who ca n't take a hint . He's a bit overweight least as a would suitor for a ballerina . Hope that does n't sound unkind and possibly a tad too old for her . Nice change of pace from Greek God wooing Super The Bill Conti score has stuck in my head all these years later which is a pretty good sign . However some of the acting is just dreadful . subplot involving a young Puerto boy befriended by Sorvino's character is just hilariously bad .

1984_8.txt,1, WARNING PLOT SPOILER The always movies of David Cronenberg certainly are an acquired taste . Fans of his earlier films will probably like but it definitely is n't one for the squeamish . All of the usual elements are here . game pod made out of skin into your back buckets of blood a gun made out of bones and a manic mechanic to name but a few . The result is good in parts bad in parts and just plain weird in others . But one thing the film has is undeniable originality . Despite the excessive use of'' weirdness it does prove a point virtual reality games can have a dangerous effect on some people . In the movie a character shoots someone dead claiming that he was that she was still in the game But it leaves the question as to whether that really happened or if it was an occurrence in this stunningly life game . leads to a conclusion that can be responded to in several ways . Despite some extra gadgets and gook it was simply your classic was all a dream'' or was it twist . It is a smart surprise and answers a few questions but giving that the entire film was leading up to this moment is a bit disappointing . At only minutes it could have went on a bit longer too . In a peculiar way the film raises moral issues but answers them in a violent and rather inappropriate way . Jennifer Jason Leigh appears here in her first big role in quite a while . But her character does n't have enough qualities to make her jump off the screen or even give her a likeable character . Jude Law on the other hand with a curious American accent is good as your average Joe sucked into this abnormal world . We see the film through his perspective . is far from flawless but it certainly is a movie experience to remember . There's tonnes of weird characteristics to match the similar styles of David Lynch next ? being consumed by a question mark ? It definitely is n't for all tastes but it is rewarding enough to recommend .

170_7.txt,1, Sorry about the extremely clever'' summary phrase . do n't know what was thinking but really could n't help myself . I've been meaning to see Birthday for a long time and must say that it was a pleasant surprise to find a copy of this film by accident and for such a low price . And believe me live in a small South American village and these things are very unlikely to happen . It's a real shame that some of these from the are now almost completely forgotten . Birthday is one of those movies that surprisingly ages well enough to remain watchable nowadays . Not a masterpiece for sure but still entertaining and guess what ? it does n't really have unintentionally funny scenes . know it's a shocker if we keep in mind that this is a low budget flick from the early about a group of evil children who kill people . But trust me the movie manages to remain respectable and watchable for the most part . In Birthday the story revolves around three children who are born during a a total eclipse . According to astrology during eclipses the sun and the moon block Saturn which controls emotions . As a consequence the three children who are born that day eventually become uncaring and evil . Since they do n't experience any feelings of remorse whatsoever these kids gang up against basically everyone who stands in their way including their own parents and siblings . and kill them ! The body count increases day after day and the police authorities believe that there's a psychopath lurking around the place . In the meantime Debbie Curtis and Steven do n't hesitate to keep butchering people since nobody seems to suspect of those sweet angel faces Like was saying before Birthday is surprisingly NOT funny . know said that before but I'm truly surprised by this . was expecting some hilariously bad scenes but the movie proved me wrong . True it's not exactly what most people would consider a horror movie but if have to be fair I'd say that the story is decently executed . One of the most important reasons why one would normally expect laughable situations did it's because in these kind of movies in which the main villains are children the young actors tend to be plain awful and they make the whole thing laughable . Let's face it kids tend to be horrible actors which is understandable and we ca n't blame them for that . But to my surprise the three young actors who played the merciless killers in this film looked very disturbing and not at all funny . The rest of the actors are also good and if you're a George Clooney fan you can see his uncle playing a doctor in this movie . Yeah know right ? who cares ? Also Julie Brown the great actress singer comedienne and gay icon gives a solid performance as the naughty older sister and in case anyone is interested in nudity she also strips in one of the scenes and she looks great naked . Too bad she did n't have more time on the screen though ! Julie is fabulous So basically this movie is fine if you're in the mood for some modest horror from the My only objection regarding Birthday would be the way to justify the children's motives . This is perhaps one of the lowest points of the film . Let's see if children who were born during an eclipse end up being heartless killers then how come these three were the only ones who actually murdered people ? I'm sure there were other children who had been born the same day . and during other days of total eclipse too oh well ! Overall no big deal it's just a simple observation that's all . I've seen worse trust me . Take Children for example in which the precocious killer get their evilness after being turned into zombies by toxic cloud . No believe me Birthday is far more decent and if you enjoy simple slashers you're going to enjoy this one very much . So now you know you're invited to the children's birthday party . and the hosts will be serving a delicious poisoned cake for you and the rest of the guests . Come on you ca n't miss it, sorry about the extremely clever'' summary phrase . do n't know what was thinking but really could n't help myself . i've been meaning to see birthday for a long time and

and siblings . and kill them ! the body count increases day after day and the police authorities believe that there's a psychopath lurking around the place . in the meantime debbie curtis and steven do n't hesitate to keep butchering people since nobody seems to suspect of those sweet angel faces like was saying before birthday is surprisingly not funny . know said that before but i'm truly surprised by this . was expecting some hilariously bad scenes but the movie proved me wrong . true it's not exactly what most people would consider a horror movie but if have to be fair i'd say that the story is decently executed . one of the most important reasons why one would normally expect laughable situations did it's because in these kind of movies in which the main villains are children the young actors tend to be plain awful and they make the whole thing laughable . let's face it kids tend to be horrible actors which is understandable and we ca n't blame them for that . but to my surprise the three young actors who played the merciless killers in this film looked very disturbing and not at all funny . the rest of the actors are also good and if you're a george clooney fan you can see his uncle playing a doctor in this movie . yeah know right ? who cares ? also julie brown the great actress singer comedienne and gay icon gives a solid performance as the naughty older sister and in case anyone is interested in nudity she also strips in one of the scenes and she looks great naked . too bad she did n't have more time on the screen though ! julie is fabulous so basically this movie is fine if you're in the mood for some modest horror from the my only objection regarding birthday would be the way to justify the children's motives . this is perhaps one of the lowest points of the film . let's see if children who were born during an eclipse end up being heartless killers then how come these three were the only ones who actually murdered people ? i'm sure there were other children who had been born the same day . and during other days of total eclipse too oh well ! overall no big deal it's just a simple observation that's all . i've seen worse trust me . take children for example in which the precocious killer get their evilness after being turned into zombies by toxic cloud . no believe me birthday is far more decent and if you enjoy simple slashers you're going to enjoy this one very much . so now you know you're invited to the children's birthday party . and the hosts will be serving a delicious poisoned cake for you and the rest of the guests . come on you ca n't miss it, sorry about the extremely clever summary phrase do n know what was thinking but really could n help myself i ve been meaning to see birthday for a long time and must say that it was a pleasant surprise to find a copy of this film by accident and for such a low price and believe me live in a small south american village and these things are very unlikely to happen it s a real shame that some of these from the are now almost completely forgotten birthday is one of those movies that surprisingly ages well enough to remain watchable nowadays not a masterpiece for sure but still entertaining and guess what it does n really have unintentionally funny scenes know it s a shocker if we keep in mind that this is a low budget flick from the early about a group of evil children who kill people but trust me the movie manages to remain respectable and watchable for the most part in birthday the story revolves around three children who are born during a a total eclipse

10393_9.txt,1, Beyond the Clouds is in many ways the weirdest film have ever seen . Not for its Cult appeal gore or even for its ideas but because of the elements that combine to make this a masterpiece of cinema . Beyond the Clouds was directed by Michelangelo Antonioni one of Italy's most famous directors . However if you gave this film only a quick watch passively mean it would seem one of those melodramatic and often pointless romances . This movie deserves great attention to the point of embracing all its cheese . By cheese do n't mean a slice but a whole brick of cheddar ! The music seems like it's from some Italian porno the story and dialogue like they are from a corny Japanese soap and the metaphors are so obvious you want to smack yourself on the head . But once you get passed all this you are engaged in an existential work of art . The cheese feeds into the subtle filming and draws our attention perfectly to what needs to be known . The basic plot is of four chapters unrelated and all about love . What we learn is that no matter what happens or what is said people can not communicate to each other . Instead they can only communicate through each other . suppose that's why the dialogue and plot is so cheesy because the conversations are overly irrational with lack of causality and people's reaction overly melodramatic . left that film thinking to myself maybe all life is one big melodrama . We judge our feelings towards others as real and purposeful . hate because have reason . But what does the hated think ? Maybe they think that my hate is stupid and arbitrary . In other words melodramatic . So melodrama is actually an existential function . corny romance is simply human interaction put under a magnifying glass allowing us to see the futility of who we are and what we do .

3002_7.txt,1, Husband doctor team Carole and Niles Nelson are doing modestly well in their careers but Niles has a gambling problem . His luck changes when he saves the life of a gangster from Joe Gurney's mob and gets a big bonus from the gangleader himself . Loving his change of fortune snazzy new apartment Niles continues to receive payoffs for patching up other injured members of the gang . Unfortunately his shady deals come to light in a police raid which hangs a shadow over his wife's career as well . At this point the plot comes into focus as Carole Nelson has to rescue her career before her license is suspended . This involves bringing the gang to justice more or less single handedly . This is not a hard gangster picture but a plot that might have been comfortable on a show like MATLOCK or MURDER SHE WROTE . There is some tension but the mood is kept light by Bogart's tongue performance of a stupid gangster who imagines himself as the Napoleon of Crime . His other gang members also function more as stooges than hoodlums . And there's some snappy dialog between Bogart and Francis especially when she's treating his injuries at his hideout . Of course as in all gangster flicks there's a big shootout ending but with a humorous twist . This is a good short film showing Bogart on his rise to stardom ., husband doctor team carole and niles nelson are doing modestly well in their careers but niles has a gambling problem . his luck changes when he saves the life of a gangster from joe gurney's mob and gets a big bonus from the gangleader himself . loving his change of fortune snazzy new apartment niles continues to receive payoffs for patching up other injured members of the gang . unfortunately his shady deals come to light in a police raid which hangs a shadow over his wife's career as well . at this point the plot comes into focus as carole nelson has to rescue her career before her license is suspended . this involves bringing the gang to justice more or less single handedly . this is not a hard gangster picture but a plot that might have been comfortable on a show like matlock or murder she wrote . there is some tension but the mood is kept light by bogart's tongue performance of a stupid gangster who imagines himself as the napoleon of crime . his other gang members also function more as stooges than hoodlums . and there's some snappy dialog between bogart and francis especially when she's treating his injuries at his hideout . of course as in all gangster flicks there's a big shootout ending but with a humorous twist . this is a good short film showing bogart on his rise to stardom ., husband doctor team carole and niles nelson are doing modestly well in their careers but niles has a gambling problem his luck changes when he saves the life of a gangster from joe gurney s mob and gets a big bonus from the gangleader himself loving his change of fortune snazzy new apartment niles continues to receive payoffs for patching up other injured members of the gang unfortunately his shady deals come to light in a police raid which hangs a shadow over his wife s career as well at this point the plot comes into focus as carole nelson has to rescue her career before her license is suspended this involves bringing the gang to justice more or less single handedly this is not a hard gangster picture but a plot that might have been comfortable on a show like matlock or murder she wrote there is some tension but the mood is kept light by bogart s tongue performance of a stupid gangster who imagines himself as the napoleon of crime his other gang members also function more as stooges than hoodlums and there s some snappy dialog between bogart and francis especially when she s treating his injuries at his hideout of course as in all gangster flicks there s a big shootout ending but with a humorous twist this is a good short film showing bogart on his rise to stardom, big snazzy new other injured shady single hard comfortable light bogart s stupid other more snappy big humorous good short, husband doctor team carole and nile nelson are doing modestly well in their career but nile ha a gambling problem his luck change when he save the life of a gangster from joe gurney s mob and get a big bonus from the gangleader himself loving his change of fortune snazzy new apartment nile continues to receive payoff for patching up other injured member of the gang unfortunately his shady deal come to light in a police raid which hang a shadow over his wife s career a well at this point the plot come into focus a carole nelson ha to rescue her career before her license is suspended this involves bringing the gang to justice more or le single handedly this is not a hard gangster picture but a plot that might have been comfortable on a show like matlock or murder she wrote there is some tension but the mood is kept light by bogart s tongue performance of a stupid gangster who imago himself a the napoleon of crime his other gang member also function more a stooge than hoodlum and there s some snappy dialog between bogart and francis especially when she s treating his injury at his hideout of course a in all gangster flick there s a big shootout ending but with a humorous twist this is a good short film showing bogart on his rise to stardom
10406_8.txt,1, NOROI follows a documentary filmmaker Masafumi Kobayashi as he slowly uncovers something mysterious and evil that's leaving a trail of dead bodies in its wake . After interviewing a woman who claims to hear loud baby's cries coming from the house next door there is no baby Kobayashi heads over to talk to the neighbor . He's greeted with hostility by the unhinged disheveled woman Takagi who answers the door promptly slams it in his face and gets a peek at her son through a window . Strangely both the woman and her son disappear just days after his visit behind a pile of dead pigeons on their back porch and the woman who first complained about the noises as well as her daughter are both killed in a mysterious accident not long after that . This piques Kobayashi's interest and he sets out on a quest to find out what's going on . He soon uncovers that those with psychic abilities and extra perception seem to be tuning into something sinister unexplainable and possibly even apocalyptic . Well clairvoyant and TV celebrity Kana Kanno seems to think we may all be doomed but she mysteriously disappears before she can be of much help . Another female psychic Matsumoto becomes involved as does Mr. Nori a mentally unstable kook who wears a hat and jacket made of aluminum foil and thinks people are being eaten by what he refers to ectoplasmic worms . Clues eventually lead back to the site of a small village that's now covered by a lake and the legend of an ancient demon known as Kagutaba . Unlike many other hand horror flicks this one depends just as much on the plot as it does reactionary first scares . Thankfully there's something of a storyline here a very interesting and intricate one at that so it does n't rely on glimpses of horrific things through spastic camera every once in awhile to keep your interest . The way Masafumi travels around following leads in search of the truth with well placed jolts along the way reminded me somewhat of THE OMEN in its pacing . The film also does n't entirely consist of footage shot by the documentarian but weaves in news reports and television variety shows as if what we're watching is an already completed documentary . That helps to break up some of the monotony usually associated with films shot in this particular style . The performances are good enough not to harm any of the realism of the footage either . Overall it's a well horror film with lots of plot shifts some suspense and quite a few genuinely creepy moments that's well worth checking out . My only real gripe is that it could have used a little trimming here and there and seems to go on a bit too long .

10795_10.txt,1, have seen it a few times and get completely glued to it every time . It is very suspenseful and intense . To describe it sounds boring but it is amazing .

1916_7.txt,1, This is definitely one of the ultimate cult classics and is a must see for all psychotronic fans . Why ? It has everything a great exploitation film should have . Over dialog bad acting enthusiasm sex sleaze political incorrectness violence and many other elements of a good cult classic are included . In other words Dolemite is a must As with a lot of these films the plot makes little to no sense . What picked up from it is that pimp Dolemite got framed up for having stolen furs and half a million dollars worth of narcotics . While he was doing time his arch nemesis Willie Green same man who framed him took over his nightclub . However the sympathetic warden only white character in the whole movie that is n't completely evil or incompetent decides to spring him free to stop the evil Willie Green and his drug trafficking . Luckily he knows kung fu as does about to of the characters in this film do . And even more luckily while he was locked up the madam Queen Bee sent all his hoes'' to kung fu school . With this army of kung fu fighting hoes'' words not mine on his side he plans to take back the nightclub from Willie Green . However two racist white cops try to frame him up again and have him thrown back in jail . As said earlier do n't try to follow the plot . I've seen this movie about five times and there are many elements that seem to have no connections to anything else . Supporting characters wander in and out of the film . I'm still attempting to figure out what was up with Reverend Gibbs the Mayor and the Hamburger Pimp . Who cares ultimately ? The scenes with these characters are all priceless . As for the dialog its horrible with even worse delivery . Since Rudy Ray Moore was originally a comedian begin to wonder if this film was meant to be a spoof or a serious action film . It seems he could n't decide which one . Lines such as Yeah I'm so bad kick my own ass twice a day'' call for further investigation . Either way the film is hilarious and the plot has more holes than a swiss cheese factory . Another hilarious element is some of the most unerotic uses of sex and nudity ever in film . Actors that you would never want to see naked get naked the Mayor and Queen Bee Not to mention the fact that the boom mic seems to show up in every other scene . Most of all Moore shows incredible enthusiasm . He seems to be having a generally good time and is certainly charismatic . His comedy raps proved to be a huge influence on latter day gangsta rap including Dr. Dre who sampled him on his groundbreaking album The Chronic'' As technically inept as the film is it is culturally influential . Even more important it is an all around good time . The biggest crime an exploitation film can commit is being boring and this for all its flaws is quickly paced and entertaining . In other words if you dig this kind of film you'll love Dolemite'' If you do n't dig it you're a no born jock motha, this is definitely one of the ultimate cult classics and is a must see for all

2954_4.txt,0, The most famous thing about this movie is that this was the first time Garbo talked in a motion picture . Aside from that you want to call it that this is a movie that does n't go beyond creaky melodrama with Garbo trying her best not to fall asleep . The plot involves Greta Garbo returning to her Father after years abroad . Her father who is a captain on a barge is happy to see her even though she's acting a bit cagey . She soon falls in love with a grizzled seaman who also notices that something a barrier if you will is holding her back . Anyways the two fellows do n't particularly like each other and soon come to blows over Garbo when she diffuses the situation by revealing her Big Secret which is no surprise to us if you've read the video box you MGM !

Come on we can see them on the Discovery channel all day long . agree with the comment that the first part of this movie is just a soap opera . The Great Predictor's grandson makes a prediction and everybody starts moaning about how he is ruining the family name . The evil mother convinces the wife to throw him out into the arms of his mistress whom she wants to meet . Can you believe that ? The wife wants to approve the new wife ! At the same time the mistress has someone in love with her that does n't have a wife but she sends him packing . Now that the soap opera is over the earthquake appears . The special effects are really good but the dubbing is bad . That is why like subtitled films .

6302_4.txt,0, Priscilla Queen of the Desert'' is always being trotted out as a masterpiece of Australian cinema . found it quite disappointing . The lead actors are great Terence Stamp is aging beautifully Guy Pearce should do more comedy instead of the dour roles he chooses and I've been a fan of Hugo Weaving since saw him play Oberon eons ago . The cinematography is great but if you've ever been to the Australian outback you'd know that the air is so clear and the light so brilliant that they could have shot it on the movie equivalent of a Box Brownie and it still would have looked spectacular . So what's my problem ? Well three things . First there is not a sympathetic female character in the whole film . woman who has to earn her living shooting ping pong balls out of her privates in a roadside pub deserves our sympathy . Tick's wife does n't get much better treatment . Second the scene when they sing Will Survive'' to a group of Aboriginals is offensive . To try to draw any sort of parallel between the struggles of drag queens and trannies and the almost total destruction of Aboriginal culture which is what assume the scene is supposed to do shows a level of historical understanding worthy of Paris Hilton . Last of all and the greatest defect of the film is that it just is n't funny enough . Did Stephan Elliott actually talk to any drag queens when writing the film ? Anyone who knows a drag queen three or four knows that most of them have rapier wits and they're not afraid to use them . Now can understand that a lot of drag queen banter probably would have got the film refused classification but Elliott should have been able to gather enough fit for the kiddies'' material to complete his film .

5156_4.txt,0, This movie features roaches as super flesh eating killers . This may have been the first movie where roaches were the primary killers though not the first movie where roaches are killers . Damnation Alley'' featured a scene with killer cockroaches and Creepshow'' had a story that had them . In this one they are the star . Not as good as it could have been this one does n't have all that many kills in them . could be wrong on that point however because have not seen this one in quite some time . The roaches have gone killer and this very strange research lady is in town to study them .

Watching the movie at in the morning to see that major parts of the book were left out frustrated me seeing that it affected the different'' outcome of the movie . There was something to be desired out of this movie but all in all it lacked in plot . For someone who has NOT read the book could see how this movie would be seen as inviting and entertaining with its controversy and suspense . However to a dedicated reader who has read it seven times did not see the strong connection between the two both the movie and the novel . With major characters missing as Maximilian Kohler and the abrupt turn in plot with the survival of the last cardinal in the preferiti the plot of the movie was slightly strewn thus leading to a different take in the conclusion of the story . The Hassassin too was portrayed as a common white man compared to that of in the novel where he was portrayed as a Muslim his motives in the book are predominately based his ties with the Illuminati however in the movie his motives are based on money and seemed more like work than some personal tie to the task at hand ., personally the book was a very well written amazing thrilling piece that was not brought to justice to the movie . watching the movie at in the morning to see that major parts of the book were left out frustrated me seeing that it affected the different'' outcome of the movie . there was something to be desired out of this movie but all in all it lacked in plot . for someone who has not read the book could see how this movie would be seen as inviting and entertaining with its controversy and suspense . however to a dedicated reader who has read it seven times did not see the strong connection between the two both the movie and the novel . with major characters missing as maximilian kohler and the abrupt turn in plot with the survival of the last cardinal in the preferiti the plot of the movie was slightly strewn thus leading to a different take in the conclusion of the story . the hassassin too was portrayed as a common white man compared to that of in the novel where he was portrayed as a muslim his motives in the book are predominately based his ties with the illuminati however in the movie his motives are based on money and seemed more like work than some personal tie to the task at hand ., personally the book was a very well written amazing thrilling piece that was not brought to justice to the movie watching the movie at in the morning to see that major parts of the book were left out frustrated me seeing that it affected the different outcome of the movie there was something to be desired out of this movie but all in all it lacked in plot for someone who has not read the book could see how this movie would be seen as inviting and entertaining with its controversy and suspense however to a dedicated reader who has read it seven times did not see the strong connection between the two both the movie and the novel with major characters missing as maximilian kohler and the abrupt turn in plot with the survival of the last cardinal in the preferiti the plot of the movie was slightly strewn thus leading to a different take in the conclusion of the story the hassassin too was portrayed as a common white man compared to that of in the novel where he was portrayed as a muslim his motives in the book are predominately based his ties with the illuminati however in the movie his motives are based on money and seemed more like work than some personal tie to the task at hand, major frustrated different strong major maximilian abrupt last strewn different common white personal, personally the book wa a very well written amazing thrilling piece that wa not brought to justice to the movie watching the movie at in the morning to see that major part of the book were left out frustrated me seeing that it affected the different outcome of the movie there wa something to be desired out of this movie but all in all it lacked in plot for someone who ha not read the book could see how this movie would be seen a inviting and entertaining with it controversy and suspense however to a dedicated reader who ha read it seven time did not see the strong connection between the two both the movie and the novel with major character missing a maximilian kohler and the abrupt turn in plot with the survival of the last cardinal in the preferiti the plot of the movie wa slightly strewn thus leading to a different take in the conclusion of the story the hassassin too wa portrayed a a common white man compared to that of in the novel where he wa portrayed a a muslim his motif in the book are predominately based his tie with the illuminati however in the movie his motif are based on money and seemed more like work than some personal tie to the task at hand

9941_4.txt,0, have read several reviews that ask the question Why was this film made'' myself found that question looming in my mind as the hour and twenty minute feature seemed to drag near the middle only to give off the sensation that it was picking up steam at the end when in actuality it was doing nothing of the sort . So Why was this film made'' think that is a great question for those watching Heftig og begeistret to ask themselves . This reviewer is proud of director Knut Erik Jensen for giving us this powerful image of hope brotherhood and inspiration with this all male choir but do not think that Jensen did enough to bring a gripping story to the table . Let me pose this question to you Do audience members need more in a documentary than just a straight forward story to maintain interest'' My answer is yes and this is where Jensen failed . Heftig og begeistret was a good documentary but it was far from great . Jensen did a horrible job with the story and dedication of the subjects . It was great to hear the songs but over time those songs seemed dull overwhelming and a bit precocious . From the opening scene where our men are singing their hearts out in a blinding snow knew that was hooked but as the film developed lost interest . Why ? Jensen never took us the audience members to the next level . He kept the playing field level and ultimately hurt the overall tone of the film . Was this a movie about the music or about the men in the choir ? The world may never know . Again would like to state that Jensen did a phenomenal job of finding an interesting story about this group of men who have definitely seen hard times and how they coped with that through music but it was as if the all male choir were a bunch of the most boring men ever created . Jensen gave us the music superbly but it was the characters the subjects that knew nothing about by the end of the film . In the mix we had a year old man who still had his driver's license we had a large man in a tub singing classic American songs we had old men who were once heartthrobs in their youth we had some tension between the youth of the choir and the veteran singers and we even had an ex addict that had only been clean for eleven years . Did Jensen develop these interesting stories at all ? Nope he left them on the table . It was obvious that these singers were willing to talk further about it the political man who missed his political days but Jensen seemed to clear away from those heartfelt moments and head straight back into interesting places that he could have the choir sing . To me the music was defined at the beginning of the film wanted to be introduced and hear the stories of these individual men . They were all captivating yet Jensen seemed to ignore them completely . By ignoring the major subjects of this documentary Jensen became unsuccessful in creating any sort of tension towards the end . Without giving the ending away felt like Jensen was coloring in the lines . Instead of being bold outside the lines he chose to create no moment of sympathy emotion nervousness or sadness . Jensen took our subjects from point to point to point without asking us to become involved in any way shape or form . can see how national sentiment had made this film into a huge success in Norway but for everyone else watching ME more was necessarily needed . wanted to feel for these guys . wanted to know if they were going to do well as they traveled or just find themselves loved in their own city . There was no story mostly in part to no development of the subjects . When you watch modern documentaries this film was made in you want it to play out similar to any Hollywood feature film . You want suspense realism and drama alas with Heftig og begeistret you get nothing of the sort . Overall must ask the question again Why was this film made'' My final answer Alex is that Jensen wanted to show how troubling times and a changing economy can still produce happiness in even the coldest places of Earth . think that Jensen wanted to show human dedication and how something as simple as singing can unite a population . With that said Jensen demonstrated that perfectly in this film but he did not create a good documentary . When you make a film of this nature feel that you must look within the group examine the choir participants and hear each one of their stories to bring about an ending that will grip your heart . The only thing that this film gripped was my attention span as it attempted to leave the room at rocket speed . Again do not want to sound negative about this film because the music was excellent and the men singing did bring about a feeling of honesty but needed more . With documentaries becoming a bigger staple of the film community one expects a bit more than what Heftig og begeistret handed to us . want to see reality and people not just another song and dance routine !

those songs seemed dull overwhelming and a bit precocious from the opening scene where our men are singing their hearts out in a blinding snow knew that was hooked but as the film developed lost interest why jensen never took us the audience members to the next level he kept the playing field level and ultimately hurt the overall tone of the film was this a movie about the music or about the men in the choir the world may never know again would like to state that jensen did a phenomenal job of finding an interesting story about this group of men who have definitely seen hard times and how they coped with that through music but it was as if the all male choir were a bunch of the most boring men ever created jensen gave us the music superbly but it was the characters the subjects that knew nothing about by the end of the film in the mix we had a year old man who still had his driver s license we had a large man in a tub singing classic american songs we had old men who were once heartthrobs in their youth we had some tension between the youth of the choir and the veteran singers and we even had an ex addict that had only been clean for eleven years did jensen develop these interesting stories at all nope he left them on the table it was obvious that these singers were willing to talk further about it the political man who missed his political days but jensen seemed to clear away from those heartfelt moments and head straight back into interesting places that he could have the choir sing to me the music was defined at the beginning of the film wanted to be introduced and hear the stories of these individual men they were all captivating yet jensen seemed to ignore them completely by ignoring the major subjects of this documentary jensen became unsuccessful in creating any sort of tension towards the end without giving the ending away felt like jensen was coloring in the lines instead of being bold outside the lines he chose to create no moment of sympathy emotion nervousness or sadness jensen took our subjects from point to point to point without asking us to become involved in any way shape or form can see how national sentiment had made this film into a huge success in norway but for everyone else watching me more was necessarily needed wanted to feel for these guys wanted to know if they were going to do well as they traveled or just find themselves loved in their own city there was no story mostly in part to no development of the subjects when you watch modern documentaries this film was made in you want it to play out similar to any hollywood feature film you want suspense realism and drama alas with heftig og begeistret you get nothing of the sort overall must ask the question again why was this film made my final answer alex is that jensen wanted to show how troubling times and a changing economy can still produce happiness in even the coldest places of earth think that jensen wanted to show human dedication and how something as simple as singing can unite a population with that said jensen demonstrated that perfectly in this film but he did not create a good documentary when you make a film of this nature feel that you must look within the group examine the choir participants and hear each one of their stories to bring about an ending that will grip your heart the only thing that this film gripped was my attention span as it attempted to leave the room at rocket speed again do not want to sound negative about this film because the music was excellent and the men singing did bring about a feeling of honesty but needed more with documentaries becoming a bigger staple of the film community one expects a bit more than what heftig og begeistret handed to us want to see reality and people not just another song and dance routine grade out of, several great heftig proud powerful male gripping more documentary straight heftig good great horrible great dull precocious snow next overall phenomenal interesting hard male boring old large classic american old ex clean eleven interesting obvious willing political political heartfelt interesting individual major documentary unsuccessful bold sympathy involved national huge own modern similar suspense heftig overall final troubling coldest human simple good only negative excellent bigger more heftig, have read several review that ask the question why wa this film made myself found that question looming in my mind a the hour and twenty minute feature seemed to drag near the middle only to give off the sensation that it wa picking up steam at the end when in actuality it wa doing nothing of the sort so why wa this film made think that is a great question for those watching heftig og begeistret to ask themselves this reviewer is proud of director knut erik jensen for giving u this powerful image of hope brotherhood and inspiration with this all male choir but do not think that jensen did enough to bring a gripping story to the table let me pose this question to you do audience member need more in a documentary than just a straight forward story to maintain interest my answer is yes and this is where jensen failed heftig og begeistret wa a good documentary but it wa far from great jensen did a horrible job with the story and dedication of the subject it wa great to hear the song but over time those song seemed dull overwhelming and a bit precocious from the opening scene where our men are singing their heart out in a blinding snow knew that wa hooked but a the film developed lost interest why jensen never took u the audience member to the next level he kept the playing field level and ultimately hurt the overall tone of the film wa this a movie about the music or about the men in the choir the world may never

The movie staring Jane Grey is very good and the musical on Broadway is the hottest thing there . So thought when heard that this film was coming out that it would be great since it was a BBC film . To my surprise it was a weak totally stupid story that UTTERLY failed in capturing the gorgeous tale . There were no exciting escapes with daring disguises . There was no deep love that made your heart flutter as Percy left the room and Marguerite sighed as her husband was leaving her again . All it had was a confusing plot and a lot of out sex and violence . Sink me !

An incredibly strange hybrid of sex comedy and vigilante thriller Young Warriors'' is just the sort of bad movie you usually hope to find when poking around the video fringe yet so rarely do . It starts off with about half an hour of wacky hi sex jokes and juvenile shenanigans an olive in the martini joke that has to be seen not to be believed Then the main character's younger sister gets gang raped by a bunch of swarthy bikers objectionable scene that keeps me from giving this a for entertainment value rape is not entertainment ! and the main character gets the rest of his sex crazed frat brothers to help him in a quest to clean up the city find the responsible bikers and kill anybody slightly criminal they run into along the way . It's hilarious non fun apart from the very unpleasant rape scene and is essential viewing to any serious bad movie fan . Trust me I've put my time in on these things and this is one of the best . Highlights include a wonderful visit to the library a great flickering slo shootout in a sleazy bar a shot of a guy blowing his own foot off that's pretty impressive a couple of decent slumming actors Roundtree Ernest Borgnine a couple of semi recognizable faces Day George scream queen Linnea Quigley and a couple of relatives of famous people Norris brother Mike Van Patten clan member James It even has one of those great What have we become ? type morality lesson endings although the turning point comes when the vigilante fratboys gun down a couple of kids robbing a store with a toy gun . I've always wondered why that was the catalyst that got the hero thinking after all whether they were kids and not hardened criminals and whether they had a real gun or not they were in fact still robbing a store so as far as can tell it was just another job well done for our vigilante frat boys right ?

9920_2.txt,0, The James Dean Story'' is introduced as different kind of motion picture explaining The presence of the leading character in this film has been made possible by the use of existing motion picture material tape recordings of his voice and by means of a new technique dynamic exploration of the still photograph . The only tape recordings of his voice'' noteworthy is one short recording Mr. Dean make while visiting his family in Indiana he wanted to record any family recollections of his great Cal Dean intrigued because he played a similarly named Cal'' in East of Eden'' Dean asks if Cal Dean was interested in art and learns the relative was an auctioneer . James Dean was interested in art and had warm relationship with his family obviously . That's the only accurate revelation in this documentary . James Dean was interested in art and had warm relationship with his family . An amazing screen test'' from East of Eden'' appears near the film's end . It's a black and white scene between Dean Cal Trask and co Richard Davalos Aron Trask Dean is at his mesmerizing best . If this scene appeared only here and no East of Eden'' film was completed this documentary would be an essential high rated film . But the scene a perfect in isolation should be considered an East of Eden'' extra . Dean's Traffic Safety Film'' is also worth seeing . There are the expected interviews with family and friends . My favorites were the guy Bracker going through a box of stuff Dean left with him and Dean's family . There was n't enough from Aunt Ortense and the letter from Dean to his little cousin was very nice . More reading of Dean's letters would have been welcome . Dean's unidentified writer friend seemed to have a better thesis for the film filmmakers might have considered developing it as a main focus . Robert Altman's direction of Martin Gabel's reading of Stewart Stern's script is dreadful . What were they thinking ? Perhaps filmmakers can be forgiven due to the closeness of Dean's passing . Do n't expect The James Dean Story'' at all . This movie is more about Dean's effect on people the fans and filmmakers than the man . It is very clearly an early piece of the James Dean myth legend'' Tommy Sands sings Let Me Be Loved'' The narrative refers to Dean as He'' with a god air . The shots of Dean's family seeming to know'' the moment he dies are truly wretched . The James Dean Story Robert Altman James Dean Martin Gabel Richard Davalos, the james dean story'' is introduced as different kind of motion picture explaining the presence of the leading character in
