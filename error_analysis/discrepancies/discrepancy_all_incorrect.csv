803_10.txt,1, The movie was very good . I'm an avid mystery fan and usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing . While did figure out who was going to be killed did n't figure out who did it . was n't happy with the portrayal of the Gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that Please know that while these Poirot movies are good they just do n't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they do n't have Japp Ms . Lemon and especially Hastings ! David Suchet is definitely Poirot . have seen every actor who's played him . The worst was Peter Ustinov !
6133_8.txt,1, stumbled upon this movie by chance . was traveling a few years back and this movie was on some channel on cable at the hotel late one night . Not much else on and figured watch it for about to minutes until decided to go to bed . Needless to say stayed up and watched the complete movie . The plot was very interesting and does make you wonder if there had not been SS who did this or at least thought of doing it . have been looking all over for this movie . even sent and email to the production company but the were n't sure that it would ever make it to DVD but said there was always hope . If anyone finds this movie drop a note here where you found it as I'd sure like to get a copy some day .
903_10.txt,1, This is a well done action movie . There are plenty of fight scenes the acting is convincing this genre and RS is awesome . do n't know why people feel compelled to trash RS thought his effects were executed very nicely and his design looked great . The plot was acceptable for a martial arts movie . Having said that must tell you Richard Sun is one of the worst actors from Hong Kong have ever watched . At least RS had the right idea by killing him . Now for all of you who thought Sam Lee was a bad actor . was n't meant to be taken seriously ! have just had the pleasure of watching Gen Cops and Sam Lee played the same character the same way ! Now please all of you guys who watch highly reviewed Oscar winners DO NOT JUDGE THIS IS THINKING MAN'S MOVIE ! IT IS N'T SUPPOSED TO REQUIRE THOUGHT ! Just meant to be enjoyed that's all . hope they make another soon .
6644_10.txt,1, gruelling watch but one of Bergman's finest films . Interesting to compare this with The Hour of the Wolf as both feature the same lead actors as artists an artist and his wife who have taken sanctuary on an island . In the earlier film it's largely inner demons that lead to von Sydows disintegrating personality least that's how read it whereas here it's very much circumstances beyond his control . Much has been written about the unsympathetic central characters particularly von Sydow's . For me there are flashes of a good flawed man early in the film but one who copes badly with adversity . The flaws become all that is left as his humanity is gradually eroded by one horror after another . watched Passion and von Sydow on their island again soon after this and was amazed to recognise many of the same locations . And then there's a dream sequence .
9028_7.txt,1, This is not a serious film and does not pretend to be but it is not as bad as some of its reviews it's title and the first ten minutes lead you to expect . The plot is very silly but this adds to the light fun and enthusiasm which runs through the film . The characters are played sympathetically and while they do engage in typical teenage angst they generally avoid the sickly sentimentality usually to be found in this film genre . Unusually set in London sympathetic to geeks this is well worth a watch if it happens to be on if you want some tongue silliness and do n't mind suspending your disbelief .
662_9.txt,1, OK so the following review is more of a synopsis more so than really containing any spoilers but better safe than sorry so as to avoid being blacklisted right ? Right ! Consider yourselves officially warned and read on . In this parody to the greatest time in horror movie history the a group of stupid teens are getting together to host a seance in the house of the notorious Murder McGee who butchered his entire family a few years back and buried them in the back yard . As I'm sure you can guess things go from bad to worse faster than you can say Where's the beef ? and in typical horror movie fashion the deaths are bloody the dialogue is cheesy and beautiful women are taking off their clothes every chance they get . Good times . No clique or horror movie clich characterizations are left unrepresented here . In fact no stone was left unturned at all we have the cool hero his innocent girlfriend the Goth chick the tough thug John Bender the hot blonde who keeps losing her shirt the shy dork in love with the hot blonde that keeps losing her shirt a couple of gorgeous half lesbians and two big geeks . As you can plainly see the cast is pretty big . Usually larger casts are where things can fall apart quickly with one or two sour apples buggering up the whole barrel . Not in this case though . Not a single cast member left me disappointed . The acting was very well done . Everyone from the cool hero in his Thriller jacket played by Jovan Meredith to the grooovy Goth chick played by Renee Dorian to Geeks One Two played by Cory Assink Jonathan Brett they all played it straight brought their and knocked it out of the park . If you're a fan of Gary Wyatt in Weird Science you'll immediately fall in love with the geeks . Director Jeff Smith is a guy to watch for in the future trust me on this . If this is what he can do with a low budget there are nothing but good things ahead for him when he gets more money for future projects . The characters were dead on the atmosphere was perfect the laughs were huge the blood flowed and squirted and sprayed beautifully it was just like watching a horror movie from the Call this one THE BREAKFAST CLUB meets NIGHT OF THE DEMONS'' The tag line says it all and says it honestly EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE GRATUITOUS NUDITY ZERO BUDGET'' no false advertising here folks ! As fans of this genre we have to look to the indies and support these hard folks who are busting their humps out there bringing us original tales lest we forever get stuck in a world filled with big studio watered PG or pointless remakes like The Hitcher . No thank you no more of that for me . In closing honestly have to say that STUPID TEENAGERS MUST DIE ! is by far one of the best indie flicks I've gotten the pleasure of watching this year . It's a bloody good time and holds up on repeat viewings . From the dialogue to the characters to the wardrobe . the closing love theme over the end credits if that does n't bring back fits of laughter recalling mid power ballads by REO Speedwagon over R's on every word starting with the letter then I'll eat my DVD right now line is if you're a fan of horror or horror in general no more hesitation this flick deserves to be in your collection !
7795_10.txt,1, Rajkumar Santoshi tries his hands at comedy and succeeds . One of the few good movies that involves Salman Khan . very funny movie from start to finish . All the characters contribute to the movie and believe me there are a lot of them . Aamir Khan Salman Khan Raveena Tandon Karishma Kapoor Paresh Rawal Viju Khote Jagdip Deven Verma Shakti Kapoor Harish Patel Tiku Talsania and more . The direction editing sound are not up to par but that still does not matter because the actors more than make up for that part .
9591_10.txt,1, looks like it's gon na cost you a whopping to buy a copy DVD or Video format ITV direct . Ouch . Sorry about this but IMDB wo n't let me submit this comment unless it has at least lines so . blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah blahblah
3928_7.txt,1, do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it . It's one of the best teenager'' horror films I've ever seen and that's saying a lot . Nothing is left without an explanation to back it up the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been submitted to lately . clear example is the mindless Saint Ange'' The first minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted . After the arrival to the village though the horror different twisted kind of horror begins . With the plot and the details goofs are minor the characters are this movie's strongest point given that so many clich are broken in it . For example the two main male characters Nick and Wade are not by any means the idiotic types we're used to although Dalton might fit better in this stereotype not is he the only one to pay for this lack of consciousness . Some scenes are truly satisfyingly horrible making up for tense moments scattered around all the film . And in the end and although everything is decorously explained it's easy to see that things wo n't go so easy to the surviving characters . The only errors can see and which do not imply continuity Carly not finding her own cut finger in the unconscious Bo's pockets is the illumination which is somehow annoying during the first boring minutes . Although plot and effects everything is drastically and cruelly twisted with the arrival of the main characters to Ambrosia that little village in the midst of nothing so I'll give it that . It's been pretty much argued that about of the movie is illogical How can two people build an entire house of wax ? Where do they get all the wax from ? These would n't be uprising questions if people would have paid more attention to the movie . The Sinclair brothers did not build the House of Wax their mother worked making actual wax figures and they were exhibited at the museum . And the scenario where Paris Hilton's unfortunate character meets her untimely death is the answer to the second question what is with all the personal objects phones cars clothes of the dead people ? Using their third brother as a connection with the exterior it's pretty much arguable that the Sinclair twins should obtain the money necessary to buy the wax in a WWII fashion . So that aside think the movie deserves a lot more than it gets and nobody should lose the chance to watch it . So go see the House of Wax . Right now .
5509_9.txt,1, do n't understand where these bad comments are coming from . The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night . The part that gets you is that this could all happen . Not to the extent perceived in the movie but the whole idea is reality . This movie took that reality and twisted it into a Dee Snider nightmare . Three thumbs up third one is from the dead body in my freezer
8423_10.txt,1, know it was supposed to be a long walk but really ! The costumes were a bit yuk but still . it was the suppose ! It was a bit long and dull so give me the newer version any day !
6826_7.txt,1, can not understand the need to jump backwards and forwards to scene set and pad out the plot . Showing that someone has a skill right before they use it believe is offending our intelligence . It's starting to feel a little contrived and as though they are making up for being so vague for the first three series . little disappointing this episode . Furthermore using past quirks like Locke's ability to know when a storm is ending is frankly insulting . are we supposed to ooh and arr or laugh at the softer side of Locke ? This episode was all over the place .
7703_8.txt,1, One of the most macabre depressing yet eye docs . I've watched in awhile . There's no narration or story that's told just a third eye'' type camera following around couples of heroin addicts in NYC through the seasons . Watching them shoot up on the floors of public washrooms then clean'' their needles in the public toilets . sometimes it's a bit too much and you need to hit pause just to go for a breather . Anyone currently in recovery of alcohol addition should watch this when they're craving it really shows you to what you could be going back to ! After seeing this it's a wonder how anyone could even try this drug to begin with . The only thing it needed was a follow up at the end to tell where these people are today . Judging from what is shown in the doc . there's no hope for any of them . They mention wanting to get better and quit but it seems the only end to their habits is to quit by way of dying . This definitely is n't for all audiences . found myself kind of like watching a car accident after started watching it just could n't turn it off . had to keep watching with a dark fascination of what it's like inside the lives of these addicts .
293_10.txt,1, would like to submit the following goof . During the bridge scene soldiers are seen wading out in the river asking to be taken away and seeking to escape . Some of the soldiers approach Captain Willard's boat and attempt to board carrying with them suitcases . Soldiers are not issued nor do they ever carry suitcases into a combat zone . They have duffel bags packs and footlockers but not suitcases . The use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of keeping . Additionally if you look closely you will see that the suitcase is floating on top of the water . This is probably a very good indication that it is empty it would sink .
5635_9.txt,1, When we are young we all pick out an ideal occupation for ourselves artist actor writer rocket scientist etc . While most of us grow out of our pipe dreams the main character of American Movie Mark has yet to let go of his at a thirty age too to become a wealthy acclaimed director . Despite the fact that Murphy's Law wo n't leave Mark alone and something always seems to go wrong Mark is able to persevere during each deterring incident with an even greater drive to reach his goals . His desire to be a director so controls his character that he sees any person or thing in his life as something to exploit to reach the goal . While noticed other IMDB commenters are lambasting Mark's selfishness think it's an almost justified sort selfishness because for Mark not becoming a famous director is equivalent to death . He talks incessantly about leaving some kind of mark on the world and he sees filmmaking as a way to do this . Unfortunately any viewer of this movie picks up early on the fact that Mark has a near chance of ever achieving his dream . Is he aware of this ? No not in the slightest and none of his family or friends want to let him in on the secret fact even some of them believe in him Strangely enough though the disappointing future the viewer feels is sure to occur for Mark does n't impede the ability to find humor in the film . This is a very very funny documentary . Most of the laughs come from when Mark is filming scenes for Coven'' There's a scene where an actor has to have his head break a cupboard and it's just not working . Another scene has Mark's very old uncle Bill saying a few lines to the camera needless to say after takes of a lot of headscratching and line Bill finally decides he's had enough . lot of humor sadly comes from Mark himself . His screenwriting which he seems to think is worthy of a Pulitzer is laughingly bad It's alright it's ok there is something to live for Jesus told me so . American Movie'' is contrary to what people might think a documentary that anyone can enjoy though my sister who watched some scenes seemed to think it was downright bizarre The fact that Chris Smith can successfully bring to the screen a film that inspires both sadness from Mark's depressing lifestyle to hilarity with scenes with Bill unfortunately passed away before the film was released says quite a lot about him . wonder how the dreamer Mark regards this documentary . Does he realize that it casts him in a bad light ? Or that it sets up to show him as a fool in many scenes of the film ? Or does he see it as something that will be shown prior to his own Biography segment ? It's an intriguing subject of wonder and hope the latter comes true for him some day . highly recommend this movie
1503_8.txt,1, honestly have to say that CAT IN THE BRAIN is one of the most fun and unintentionally hilarious films I've ever seen . This film is packed with stupid dialog ridiculous scenes and a self plot starring legendary horror director Lucio Fulci himself . The threadbare story is about an aging director who is also named Lucio Fulci in the film . is starting to go nuts and hallucinate because of all the vicious things he's put down in film over the past many years . He goes to a shrink who hypnotizes Fulci and tells him that he will believe himself to be a killer but that the shrink will actually be the one doing the killing . The rest of the film is made up of shots from the film'' that Fulci is directing during all this action scenes of the shrink killing people all grinning like a moron and some of Fulci's hallucination sequences . Oh and a few tits thrown in for good measure as well . CAT IN THE BRAIN is completely over ridiculous in every sense . The gore is classic Fulci nasty and strong with some really decent scenes . The chainsaw sectioning of a female corpse is pretty cool as is the chainsaw beheading of a small boy . Lots of stabbings gougings and other cool kill make this one a pretty non bloodbath . The ridiculous dialog IT ! IT ! as well as some of the insanely goofy scenes Nazi orgy the opera singing slap and the running down of an innocent hippy come easily to mind . make this one fun as hell . Not nearly as dark as some of Fulci's other films CAT is more of a self horror that if it was n't meant to be funny is actually kind of sad . say to grab a fifth of cheap bourbon and settle in to this one . watched CAT with a few friends and we laughed the entire time . THIS is the feel movie of the summer .
688_7.txt,1, This seemed to be a lackluster film to me that betrays a low budget with poor cinematography and not all that great of a job of editing . It may be of interest to those who know something about submarines during the World War II era but recommend that all others beware . Many of the scenes in this film were flat and some of the actors were a bit weak . The story about the men getting called back to duty during a short leave seems realistic enough but there's no real pacing or tension in the story . also had a tough time understanding what the actors were saying partially due to some strong English accents and perhaps some due to an inferior job of sound recording . give this a Most folks will want to steer'' clear .
6730_7.txt,1, So after years and years finally track this film down ! was dying to see how it lived up to my memories . distinctly remembered the shots of the ghost boy running down the mine then waiting behind two planks of wood crossed in the mineshaft just staring out with a pale white face . This single shot was probably the most chilling shot of my childhood remember chills running down my spine . Watching it now its obviously nowhere near as scary but quite subconsciously strange to see the same images again . If anyone wants a copy private message me . The story itself is fairly standard BCFF stuff . Its strange though that the message is pretty unclear this time around there is no real moral as such that are here to help us ? or be prejudiced against ghosts ! There was n't even a greed angle in terms of wanting to profit from the mine . However a massive act of irresponsibility from the captain encouraging the two kids to actually follow the vague implications of a ghost not only into a mine but into a new mine hole which is totally dangerous . The captain then encourages the children to climb down a huge ladder deep into the mines simply because he thinks the ghost wants them too . Its also a bit odd that the ghost chooses the boy to help the trapped adults and not just help the trapped adults direct . Oh well .
8531_10.txt,1, You got to love this movie ! mean what other Swedish splatter movie could be so evil bizarre and totally cruel . whole movie is stuffed with some kind of weird humor like The old cencoreguy just blows his head off and the boss just wipes the blood off his glasses and says with a mean voice Your fired ! wouppie !
1598_10.txt,1, His music especially what we hear of it here is very slow . From around the time of Bach's death composers had been working out ways of making music progress at a slower and slower pace over a century later Wagner and then Mahler wrote pieces that are about as slow as it is possible for music to get . course one can cheat by writing a march and then specifying a tempo of say semiquaver but that tempo would n't be the correct tempo . Wagner and Mahler wrote music that is PROPERLY played at a snail's pace . Given that the slowness in no sense sounds too slow snail's pace'' is the wrong expression . critic wrote of a famous Wagner conductor He does n't beat time he beats eternity . For all know this was meant as a compliment . get the feeling that around the early directors worked out how to make the slowest possible films there's Death in Venice'' and there's Solyaris'' much prefer the former . For one thing Solyaris'' steps over the line or some line and becomes soporific Death in Venice'' is gripping from beginning to end . Not much happens but it all happens in the right sequence at the right pace with photography you can get lost in Another way of cheating with music by the way is to write something that does n't really have a tempo at all . Such music sounds slow but is really just unmusical just as many films feel slow because they lack rhythm and form . Death in Venice'' is n't one of them . Beautiful in every respect it will remind you of the timelessness and contextlessness of quality . You need no theoretical knowledge to respond to Visconti's mastery as you do to respond to a lesser director's incompetence . It's a great work .
1376_8.txt,1, was having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me and could n't put it down until the end . and had forgotten about my horrid day . and the ending . by the way . where is the sequel ! the budget is obviously extremely low . but look what they did with it ! it reminds me of a play . they are basically working with a tent a pod a few guns uniforms camping gear and a thing . that is it for props . Maybe this is even a good thing forcing the acting and writing to have to step up and take their rightful place in film as the centers of the work instead of as afterthoughts used to have an excuse to make CGI fights The cgi is fine . It is not exactly but imho it still works . why ? because there is n't too much of it and what there is is not over with an army of effects house people trying to cram everything they can into the shot . it prompts the imagination . it's some relatively simple stuff with decent composition the heavy freighter shot . there is one long shot that must be at least ten seconds . tracks the entire length of the ship . it must be a record for sci fi battle sequence film making in the past years to have an action sequence that lasts longer than seconds and some relation to the story . it might look old or not of the art but it does n't look stupid and it does n't take away from the story . The acting is good except the characters die too fast to get to know them . The captain was great but a few of his scenes could have used another take . also got confused with his character losing his cool and stomping on a corpse like to think captains are calm cool and in control . what was going on in that scene ? did the other crew worry about him losing it at that moment ? did he feel himself losing control ? Now as for the plot . mostly it is good . why ? Because it does n't try to explain itself . It just happens . It's called planet its a mystery get it ? Nobody knows why there is a statue and they do n't find out either . The mysterious cult ? The weird scientist with the tattoo ? What do you expect to find out in less than minutes ? This is n't War and Peace . And thank god it's not star wars either . No midichlorians no minutes of expository boring dialog that has no purpose in the story . The characters are stranded and are only able to figure out a few basic things . it is not a star trek episode where they find out it's leonardo davinci or a child like space wanderer . It is mysterious and liked that . do n't know why maybe can identify with these guys more since they do n't know whats happening and do n't either . they do n't talk a lot of space gibberish or have magic boxes telling them what is happening . In fact would argue that one of the weakest moments is when the turns on the crew and tries to the reason for the planet the cult etc . This coincidentally has some of the weakest dialog imho in the whole movie and it interrupts the flow and some of the characters look unnatural in that scene . OK sometimes felt it was a little too mysterious though . Like why did the guy get fried through his eyes with lightning ? That was odd . Just weird . The ending . again would have liked to have known some of these characters better . And would it have been so hard to have a second rescue scene at the end ? This is not a serial show it was a film and we like closure in films even if they can have a sequel . Imagine Hamlet with no of angels sing thee to thy rest Anyways . What can say . This was well worth the dollar payed at the box machine at the supermarket . It was also imho a better piece of storytelling than starwars parts or Like said it sucked me in wanting to know what was happening and could n't stop watching until the end .
7623_8.txt,1, Great cult flick for MST types Richard Boone is a mess bad hair arthritis even his dark glasses are n't right about as good as a bad dino can get . actually that charging saber Styracosaurus was pretty cool maybe Spielberg should take a couple of notes from that one .
7666_8.txt,1, This show was incredible but too esoteric for most people . If you had never truly seen a European variety show in the or at least a Mexican one the entire show would probably be lost on you . If you had this show was a dead on skewering satire of the phony spectacle and shallowness that these shows dive into at their worst . Helmed by a chain suave wannabe with a pencil moustache and his ultra and immasculating harridan of an EX Viva Variety'' is a variety show that tries to get off the ground every episode but always descends into in and acts gone very wrong . The hosts are joined by Johnny Bluejeans'' a dim witted side who seems to have been named because blue jeans are a very popular product in his country and that means the kids will like him which of course they do n't . The result was a hilarious spoof of variety shows in general . Imagine the arguing that probably happened BACKSTAGE during the last days of the Sonny Cher Show'' Now imagine it's happening ONSTAGE in front of you and the stars are trying to keep their composure . Now add cheesy acts and a Euro mentality gowns booze accents and smokes NOW you have Viva Variety'' Have you ever heard a musician whose music was pretty much written for other musicians ? Too conceptual ? Viva Variety did this for comedians . WAY too esoteric for the standard American audience . It was funny as Hell . And doomed .
667_10.txt,1, Who ever put that review as bad taste is not all quite there . its so funny genius and fantastic you could watch it until your eyes are square ! not to mention the rest of the work he has done on the rest of the series . is as good as Morris standards . if you think that it is or then can only think of one thing to say to you go to hell . thanks . it had to be said ! think that the way that so many people complaining was a complete joke . would like to make a shout out to all the people that actually did that have n't you got anything better to do with your time ? what are you trying to prove ? thanks for reading my heart review on the matter .
12123_7.txt,1, do n't know if it's fair for me to review this . I'm not a fan of gratuitous violence . I've never understood the movie industry making heroes out of mob members and cold blooded killers . When The Godfather came out thought they had broken the mold but the decades have produced a series of well mob movies with major stars and directors doing them . This one is obviously low but it is certainly well done . At some point in all of these feel like want to take a shower . If such characters actually exist it is hard for the soul . always intellectualize that humankind will rise above this sort of thing . This kind of crud has to be stopped . hope the people that go to films like this are more voyeuristic and less vicarious . feel sort of the same way about slasher movies . Why do we have a fascination with death and dismemberment ? In fairness am judging this on the acting and directing and for what it is it seems to work pretty well .
1241_7.txt,1, The story is quite slow at the beginning except few interesting humour that come along the way but some of the plot still empty . The science on how the kid entered the century is still a mystery except at the end of the movie we have been shown of how . Other than that everything looks ok !
7831_8.txt,1, Ladies and gentlemen we've really got ourselves a winner here . Actually we do n't but boy is this film an often hilarious and always entertaining horrible hoot of a stinker . Poor Alma Julia Ruiz is suffering from an ancient Mayan curse that causes lethal poisonous snakes to grow inside of her body . Alma and her deranged shaman husband Brujo Castro who feverishly overacts with delicious eye intensity stowaway on a train that's bound for Los Angeles . Naturally a bunch of deadly vipers get lose so they can terrorize the motley assortment of passengers . The Mallachi Brothers working from an absurd script by Eric Fosberg treat the ridiculous premise straight thereby creating a wonderfully wretched piece of deliriously campy cheese . The cruddy CGI effects the pathetically unfrightening common variety Gardner snakes would scary rattlesnake noises added to the soundtrack to imbue them with a faint sense of otherwise nonexistent menace the plodding pace the total dearth of any tension or momentum the obvious rickety stage train set and especially the simply astonishing you got ta be kiddin me ! over preposterous ending are all downright awesome in their very jaw awfulness . Better still we also got game lame acting from a no cast a nice smidgen of tasty gratuitous female nudity a funky hum'n score and plenty of extremely gross and grotesque make Bonus points for the fact that the token irritatingly cutesy little girl gets eaten by a large reptile and for the stoner engineer who gets caught smoking crack out of a hollow light bulb An absolute gut of a kitsch howler .
12222_7.txt,1, This DVD set is the complete widescreen run of Surface'' a television show made by Universal in The full running time is hours and minutes plus a few bonus features scenes cast interviews special effects featurette This was a relatively high budget show and much of the budget makes it to the screen in the form of quality production design and special effects . Unfortunately hours is a lot of time and as typically happens with this type of stuff the overall quality begins to fall off in the later episodes . found the first episodes and extremely engaging and the remainder a disappointment . Surface'' was produced written and directed by Josh and Jonas Pate and it appears that they were surprised by the success of the series and unable to cobble together enough good subsequent material as they rushed to fill the order for additional episodes . It even looks like additional writers were brought in for the later episodes because the characters were already the weakest part of the series lack consistency with the way they were played in the early episodes . The series was canceled and although the last episode provides a conclusion of sorts there are still a lot of things left hanging . It is basically a science fiction story about genetically created dragons sort of a television blend of Jurassic Park'' and ET'' The story begins as a puzzle as a crew Navy sub is found adrift at sea boaters on a Texas lake are sucked into whirlpool a lighthouse in Africa is destroyed by a huge monster etc . etc . And as long as things stay this vague there is a fair amount of tension and suspense . human element is introduced in the form of three American families one on each coast and one on the Gulf of Mexico . Laura Daughterty Bell is a California marine biologist who discovers a strange creature rising from an undersea thermal vent on the ocean floor . Rich Connelly Ferguson is diving with his younger brother in the gulf when a similar creature drags his brother away to be seen again Miles Bennett Jenkins is a Wilmington teenager who finds some strange eggs floating in the ocean . He takes one home where it hatches into an ET'' type dragon . He will spend the rest of the series trying to hide his strange pet from his family and from the local authorities . These dragons may look like lizards but they are more like indestructible electric eels firing electromagnetic pulses causing lightning strikes emptying the sea of fish and reproducing like a bunch of randy rabbits when they find an undersea thermal vent of boiling water . As long as it's uncertain whether or not they're intelligent extraterrestrial or harmless the premise is interesting . Once you begin to suspect their origin it all gets very tired and predictable . Jay Ferguson staggeringly bad actor in the tradition of David Hasselhoff essentially plays the Richard Dreyfuss character from Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' so you know that with a better actor and a better director it could have been an interesting character . You will grow to hate this character more with each episode . Unfortunately what starts out as three parallel story lines is soon condensed into two as Ferguson and Bell low version of Sandra Bullock are soon paired up and involved in a series of moronic adventures almost as improbable as the stuff Jason Bourne'' gets himself into . You expect plot holes and the need to suspend disbelief in this type of show can even be part of the fun but their adventures are not just totally implausible they are utterly and completely boring . There are three consecutive episodes that feature Ferguson and Bell together in a submersible that will have you longing for the excitement of an all actuarial conference . Jenkins is the strongest member of the cast and the segments with his pet dragon are inter often enough with the boring Ferguson stuff to keep you watching . And these segments benefit from the presence of gorgeous Leighton Meester recent Gossip Girl'' fame as his sister Savannah . Apparently the producers picked up on the importance of this to their teenage boy'' target audience and the one positive thing they did with the later episodes of the series was to introduce Linsey Godrey as a first love'' interest for Miles . So as Savannah's screen time decreases Catlin is gradually phased in . In retrospect they needed a third storyline to keep viewers sufficiently engaged and it would have been better to limit the adult melodrama in favor of a second group of young actors . Then again what do know ? I'm only a child .
742_8.txt,1, I'm not sure what intrigues me about this movie so . It is grainy poorly written bleached out often ridiculous and at many points mind numbingly dull person was watching it with fell asleep twice . And yet there is something in this film that fascinates me though am not sure what perhaps the character of Sam an enormous former patient who was lobotimized by the former head doctor and who is perpetually sucking on an ice pop or the marvelously played head doctor forget her name Anyway watch it and form you're own opinion it has one of the greatest endings have seen in film .
10376_10.txt,1, was surprised that liked this movie . But it reminded me of a version of the first Friday the There were a number of cheesy elements yet at the same time there were many cool ones . The story line was good if you have seen more than one or two horror movies but full of one to make it worthwhile . There are some memorable scenes worth watching . few issues had with the plot had to do with the continuity of the characters . For instance in the opening scene the scarecrows were humans on stakes whose blood was drained to grow the crops looked very real but later in the film they looked more like fake scarecrows wearing blue colored masks . There were more than several gaps in the plot and the acting was mediocre but at least it sounded like how real people talk unlike Hollywood movies where the dialogue is really fake sounding when you think about it . The culmination of the last scene when the main character says I'm not a Baker I'm a Connell ! and lops the head off of the scarecrow is satisfying as his friends have for the most part been killed off by these creatures at that point .
11420_7.txt,1, Critics and audiences both pretty much panned this movie but actually did n't think it was too bad ! Even the critics normally agree with thought it was crap and normally despise PG horror films . So this means one of two things either I'm too easily pleased and my taste in movies has dwindled over the years or a Stranger Calls is n't nearly as horrible as it's made out to be . Now to be fair some of the criticisms of the movie are true not much character development and not much happens in the story . But man alive folks how much were you expecting from a movie about a babysitter being stalked ? Cut them some slack ! As a former babysitter who was watching this flick late at night with the lights out can safely say the stalker dude was one creepy mofo ! Who knows ? guess stuff like this just gives me the willies . Yes admit had fun watching this and do n't care how big of a minority that puts me in .
1619_10.txt,1, This is a low budget stop motion monster movie from Brett Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell Piper . and it delivers just what I'd expect from such a production light cheesy dialogue some cute actresses and lots of stop motion critters . That's why I've given the film out of because it delivers what expected it to deliver . and a bit more Brett does n't penny when it comes to putting his critters on screen . He hurls lots of bugs at his cast for the finale . And anyway LOVE stop motion monsters which compared to CGI critters in bigger budgeted movies just seem to be that much fun to watch .
5507_7.txt,1, This off horror movie seems to be getting nothing but bad reviews . My question is why ? think this movie is pretty good . Dee Snider did very well for his first only time directing . He also plays the antagonist Captain Howdy Hendriks This movie seems to have a view of the future . Although it came out back in it seems to be about modern issues . Internet predators seems to be the underlying plot here . Although taken to another level this is an issue which we still face today . I'll admit the story fell short a few times but that does n't make this a bad movie at all . Robert Englund is even in this movie that automatically makes it better . THe acting was n't bad the characters were pretty good as well . Hendriks was a pretty good antagonist think . give this off horror a Recommend for fans of Saw .
4193_7.txt,1, The Beatles had just done Mystery Tour . There was the general feel that performance peace and drugs went together naturally . In LA there was a film subculture that knew something was up . Nicholson was in several of these gangs . Before he decided to seriously become an actor before Rider before Flamingos before for Night there were several experiments with what to do about this . An important one is Manuscript . This is another . Jack writes . He plays with circular narrative self film reference performance self the pain of creation all on the outskirts of safe kiddiepop . You must see this if only to know something about Jack . Certain actors act by digging into themselves . It is a common technique . Some dig deep but after a while they become boring because they are incredibly shallow people . There is n't just enough stuff in there to sustain a career . Think of DeNiro and Hackman . Others are pretty interesting people who seem to become more interesting over time . When they dig into the barrel they put stuff back in because of the pain of the digging . Think Sean Penn and Jack . At the bottom of Jack's barrel at the end of the thread he spins as the base of every character is this experimental risky writer Who cares if it is a bad movie ? It is bad because it took risks . Watch when a tear is wiped from Annette's cheek by the director . It is a loving goof on the whole Brando thing something that heard Marlon laughed about . That is one of the richest moments in Hollywood film history . There's another reason to watch this . Music in film is has a strong root in dance . Revolution in film often relies on music . Whole cultures are thus swept along . An unsung giantess in inventing how billions now dance is Toni Basil . She was as influential in pop choreography as the Beatles were in music . She was already well into her career when called upon to work on this . But this is one of her earliest screen appearances . You can see her work throughout and she herself in the pretty cool Girl segment over one of Nilsson's better songs . by the Frank Zappa cameo . McCartney would reference this scene in his TeeVee special years later . third reason to watch is early minutes in the film a character named Pleasure kisses each Monkey in a long continuous shot and then dismissively departs . She is credited as Jefferson but is really Mimi Manchu Nicholson's lover at the time and LSD partner . Red hair psychedelic demeanor . Lovely . That scene says it all for me about how Jack feels about the boys . Ted's Evaluation of Worth watching .
5589_10.txt,1, think Crewes did her evil part very well she should have won an award . Anything that Dunne is in . is salvageable because Dunne is a great actress and can pull anything off even a weak script . Therefore WOULD recommend it for this reason alone . This movie may have been a little ahead of it's time the plot might be more acceptable these days . During the golden age of Hollywood movies were meant to entertain or teach mostly to make us feel good or cope with the times . This plot seem to deviate from that profile . Yet again must say what ever Irene Dunne was in at least was good'' because she made things so believable ! The only other actress can say made me think this way was maybe Deborah Kerr . Watch Silver Cord if you get the chance for the acting'' if nothing else .
1708_7.txt,1, As talk go Larry King Live is not bad and since he occasionally gets good guests it's a show to turn on once in awhile but not compulsively . When Bill Maher Carl Bernstein a former president or other substantive guests sit across from him it's not too bad . Other times he tends to host guests involved in the latest celebrity scandal which contributes absolutely no intelligent information to the country and feeds a largely uneducated public that wants to hear the latest gossip about movie and TV stars . During the OJ Simpson trial it seemed like every other guest on his show was related to the case . But is this really journalism ? Or the National Enquirer on the tube ? Sometimes it comes off a little bit like trash television Springer in a sit down interview with phone calls instead of a live audience . On the other side King's show is definitely much better than Bill O'Reilly whose show is nothing more than a rightest platform of the Rush Limbaugh variety . That said Larry King is not a bad interviewer but alas he is not a great one . King does not always come off like he completely comprehends when intellectual material is being presented especially if it is by a scholar or historian with a new book on subtle aspects of politics . Always seems like the minute King ca n't quite deal with the issue at hand that's when he turns to the phone calls maybe hoping someone out in the country will have a better question than he has . He might interview someone like David Gergen but may not have read any of his books . Sort of like the movie producer that never bothers to read the script . When it's an entertainment celebrity no problem . He can come off like he's thoroughly knowledgeable since the material is not that substantive anyway . Talking to Elizabeth Taylor about her relationship with Richard Burton is not exactly rocket science . And notice he usually has seen the star's latest movie . Watching a movie takes much less time and contemplation than reading a book . However if it's the likes of John Dean or Bob Woodward King comes off a little like he did n't quite finish his homework . So off to the phones . If you are looking for real in interviewing Terry Gross of NPR is probably the best interviewer in the United States . She reads and researches everything written by or about her guests beforehand and has a working knowledge of those areas . do n't see King quite doing that . Granted he probably has an audience times larger than Terry Gross which may say more about the American audience than King . In short Larry is better than Bill but not as good as Terry .
1157_9.txt,1, Why could n't the end of the movie have been Sean Connery's men fighting the French instead of the Germans . Ever since the French had occupied Algeria in the tribes from Morocco and those of Algeria were making raids on the French military and civilian settlements . This movie could have been a continuous of that historical aspect where the French had seize the Rasuadli so his followers would not be raiding Algeria and then his followers would have attacked the French to free him . The movie is still stereotypical of shootouts between the Germans and the Americans . When the Americans shoot the Germans their guns the pistols make loud noises create large bloody bullet wounds and their enemies are screaming after being shot . When Germans shoot at the Americans their guns do n't make large sounds do not create bloody wounds and their enemies make little or no sound after being shot . In real life the American Krag rifle was the worst rifle America had ever produce until the early version of the came along . The Krag was hard to maintain not reliable and the rifle bolt was always jamming . The German Mauser was one of the world's finest rifles . We were so impress by it during Spanish American war that we made a copy of it and call it the Springfield rifle . Finally the people of Morocco must had a word for artillery since the French were using them in their raids against Morocco . did n't like it when they made the Rasuldai feel stupid that there was no word for artillery in the Moorican vocabulary . Instead the Rasuadli stated that the Europeans had guns on wheels that make the ground shake .
9496_8.txt,1, thought this movie was really good . It ends up showing the viewers in the end that Leila should of kept what she had . Leila was sick of her husband Jim who was more worried about work then her . He was so into his work that he forgot their anniversary . He was also very sloppy . She could n't take it anymore so she left to see if he would miss her . The movie shows that he misses her he even tries to make up for the night he messed up . He goes to her and tries to bring her home . She ends up finding another man named Schuyler . He seemed like the man she always wanted neat and notices her . In the end she sorta foreshadows by when she look at Schuylers shoes and the way he let his cigar ashes fall on the floor the way Jim did the same kinda thing . Jim ends off making lots of money and cleaning himself up . Leila thinks in the end that she should of kept her husband because thats all she really wanted and he did changing .
3526_7.txt,1, Well sadly ca n't help but feeling a little bit disappointed after my much much MUCH viewing of Just Before Dawn'' Jeff Lieberman is a terrific filmmaker and he can undoubtedly do great things with a tiny budget but nevertheless expected to see a far more sadistic and gruesome early slasher . But actually I'm beginning to think that Lieberman is n't the one to blame for this but WE gorehounds are ! It's more than obvious that Lieberman intended to make his take on the backwoods look like Deliverance'' and absolutely NOT like Friday the which immensely popularized the sub genre one year earlier . The horror and constant sensation of menace does n't mainly come from the demented maniacs with their machetes but from the genuinely ominous and isolated Oregon forests where this movie was shot . In case the film seems slow and uneventful this is only because Lieberman takes his time to introduce the dark woods and eerie mountains as extra characters in his film . We hardly ever see the killers in person but there always appears to be someone luring from behind the trees or from underneath the mountain lakes . Bearing this in mind Just Before Dawn'' becomes a highly admirable horror effort and actually a lot better than its contemporary blood colleagues . Amidst a nearly endless selection of gory and sickening slashers Lieberman successfully puts the emphasis back on tension and character development . The plot revolves on five twenty friends heading for a camping vacation in the Oregon woods where one of them owns a small piece of land . The woods are deserted and naturally the campers ignore forest ranger Roy's Kennedy ! advise to return back to civilization . Shortly after they brutally encounter an inbred family of which the twin sons have murderous tendencies . All five main characters are surprisingly likable and convincing ! No irritating stereotypes for which you do n't feel sympathy anyway like slutty girls or football jocks . As a result of this natural'' character you automatically cheer for them even when they eventually almost turn into savages themselves . The sublime camera supplies the film with an at times unbearable tension level and Brad Fiedel's chilling electronic score only adds to this effect . Just Before Dawn'' is a fine slice of early horror as long as you do n't desire blood to drip from your TV
949_8.txt,1, Tumbling Doll of Flesh'' by Tamakichi Anaru is a Japanese shocker about three thugs who sexually abuse and dismember a young woman whilst filming their horrible actions . twisted Japanese porno sickie that offers plenty of sadistic sexual violence and grisly gore . is no plot to speak of plenty of hard core sex scenes censored again lots of blood . special effects are quite impressive dismemberment of Japanese porn actress is shown in unflinching detail . tongue cutting scene really made me squirm . arm is also chopped off and her stomach is graphically sliced open and finally one of the sickos is having sex with her intestines . Snuff Reels'' actually reminds me Guinea Pig of Flesh and Blood'' it's not as memorable . if you're a fan of ultra Japanese sickies like All Women Are Whores'' or Raping My Virgin Slave'' give this one a look . out of
9295_10.txt,1, No matter what country your In you have to buy this show Sure It is Australian and if you ever seen any attempt of our comedy's they pretty much suck but with the chaser's they are n't boring forty year old men making bad puns they are a team of people who talk about current affairs much in Australia make fun of our crap ads make fun of our politicians and so on . The guys also had a show in called Cnnnn which was not as successful as the War which had only started this year so everything they talk about is current news which is really good considering no matter how boring or tragic it is they try to shine some humorous light on things .
2902_8.txt,1, saw this movie back in on a double with Valley of the Kings . These movies helped inspire a lifelong interest in Egyptology . visited Egypt ! Seen today The Egyptian'' suffers from flat dialog and a few gauche touches but it's a glorious movie to look at the sort of thing Hollywood alas just does n't do anymore and it has a great story . not just the usual boy or vengeance affair . Too bad wo n't re restored prints of this to be seen on the Big Screen .
1514_7.txt,1, Lucio Fulci's Cat in the Brain is an inventive and somewhat egotistical tale of a director's decent into madness . The director in question is Fulci himself who stars in the film . Fulci has become known to horror fans everywhere as godfather of gore and for good reason as he has provided us with some of the nastiest and most gruesome films ever to grace the silver screen from the eyeball violence in films like to a man been hacked to death with chains in Beyond all the way to the full on gore fest known as New York Ripper if you want gore let's face it who does n't Fulci is your man . However all this catering for gorehounds like you and has taken its toll on Fulci's mental state and he's quickly delving into madness brought about by what he films . Fulci's problems do n't end at his mental state either as his psychiatrist that he has gone to see about his problem has took it upon himself to take up murder as a hobby using Fulci's films as blueprints for the murders ! I've got to say the acting in this film is absolutely atrocious . There is one scene in particular that involves a hooker and it's only fit to be laughed at for both it's acting and it's stupidity . Fulci takes the lead role of the film He's not an actor and it shows but his performance is actually the best in the film . It's even safe to say that one the whole the acting is bad for an Italian horror film . Of course nobody goes into an Italian horror expecting good acting so it's somewhat forgivable but do think that Fulci could have hired some better ones . Bad dubbing does n't exactly help either . However something that does help is the fact that the terrible acting is counterbalanced by lots of gore and it's extreme to say the least ! People get their heads cut off a woman is slain in the shower unlike Psycho here we REALLY see it people are hacked up fed to pigs and there's lots and lots of cinema's finest melee weapon the chainsaw on display which delighted me no end . The amount of gore is massively over the top a lot of the time which gives the film something of a feel but Cat in the Brain is obviously a tongue in cheek film anyway . It would be hard to make a film about yourself and not come across as being a bit of a big head and Fulci does indeed come across as a bit of a big head in this movie . His name is mentioned often and he's on screen nearly all the time it's not too much unlike Nightmare in the ego stakes but it's obvious he had a good time making this and for one had fun watching it so we can forgive him a little egotism . The film's ending lets it down saw it coming a mile off but then did n't seriously think that the movie would take that route but was wrong it did unfortunately . The ending left me cold and the film is a better watch if you turn it off just before the final two minutes . However despite it's ending and terrible acting Cat in the Brain is a lot of fun and will please Fulci enthusiasts no end and it is therefore recommended .
3983_10.txt,1, just wanted to say that . love Gheorghe Muresan so automatically loved this movie . Everything else about it was so Billy Crystal is a good actor even if he is annoying . But the thing that made this movie was at least for a basketball fan seeing Gheorghe Muresan act .
10194_7.txt,1, This movie is an evolutionary piece from Terminator to Robocop Stan Winston did the SPFX In this film a scientist working in a sinister robotics company with a really creepy boss always are gets is killed by them in a horrible lab explosion and has his brain placed inside an indestructible robot body The rest of this movie goes on with a romance angle as this Cyborg regains consciousness and wreaks havoc while trying to communicate with his wife played by the gorgeous then in Terri Austin tries to reconnect with his old life like in that scene in RoboCop The rest of this movie is about breaking things while trying to defeat the evil his evil boss from recapturing him for some ill humans into cyborgs project This film pays homage to previous movies like THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL as the cyborg breaks free like the giant robot Gort does Except for the Suite designed by Stan Winston this movie's production values are typically Canadian SLEAZY Pam Grier stars in this film as an hired killer a cheap role of the likes she was doing so much of during the As for a Sci Horror movie out of Stars this film ranks about a
10500_7.txt,1, Thank you The FilmZone for showing this sleazy soft core sex flick at truly enjoyed it . To be honest expected a lot more from a sexy cast with McKayla Dru Berrymore and of course the talented Chloe Nicholle Rebecca Carter The production values are truly bad mainly because of the low budget but a little more effort would n't harm . For example the cinematography makes it look like a hard core porno movie . There's absolutely no effort in lightning . But let's ignore that fact because let's be honest we watched Pleasures of Sin'' because of the high amounts of sex . The sex factor is pretty good and offers steamy explicit scenes . Chole Nicholle delivers the best performance of the female cast . So my advice is watch this movie if you are in the mood for good explicit sex or just watch it if you are a fan of Mrs. Nicholle . Recommended only for the sex scenes do n't expect anything else .
629_7.txt,1, enjoyed the acting in this movie . Except for the sister . She reminded me of Janice on Friends . could never quite believe she was anything but obnoxious . My main problems with the movie were the anticlimatic ending and the execution scene with the sister and brother The guy falling out of the exploding car ? Maybe if his hand had been blown off and he ran to the mute for help and she kissed him and rushed him to a hospital maybe then could have gone for the ending . think somebody needed to die in the execution scene . Mainly the brother He was such a pain in the ass anyway . Or maybe the sister needed to accidentally kill the guy who saved the mute . could have even bought into the brother killing the hero and the ending being the two sisters being put in snuff films . It is worth watching again and as always say it is much easier to be a reviewer instead of an author .
2780_7.txt,1, forsee many students now signing up for student exchange to Barcelona and being disappointed when they do n't have quite such an exciting time . The movie was enjoyable . It's of course always a pleasure to see Audrey Tatou . However have a very strong issue with part of the movie . The lesbian roommate tells Xavier that women like to be physically dominated take issue with and shows him some sort of butt move that's guaranteed to get a woman . Xavier then tries out the butt grab on a shy married friend who starts out saying no no'' I'm married I'm married'' but then somehow succumbs to the butt grab ? All of a sudden she's moaning yes yes'' and they're going at it on the benches in Parc Guell . found this really really offensive . Furthermore it is very stereotyped . How often have we seen scenes where the woman says no'' but obviously does n't mean it ? No means no . Grabbing butts domination is n't going to make it right . It just totally supported the stereotypical rape myths . was n't even sure how to read the next scene where he gloats to the lesbian about how it worked and how next time he was just going to demand suck it slut'' something like that Did he really think forcing himself onto a woman with no respect for her feelings was the way to go ? This section really ruined the movie for me .
4228_7.txt,1, The Child's Play series is n't a favourite of mine but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay movie . This time we have two dolls Chucky and his former girlfriend he was human Tiffany . Together they go on a journey to find an object . There are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy getting hit by the truck and literally exploding the sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany and the ending which allows for another sequel to take place . Was n't really a straight forward horror it mixed a lot of comedy and was a sort of spoof of the horror genre . This made the movie better like comedy does do with many horror movies . All up even if your not a Child's Play fan give this one a go .
945_7.txt,1, The Japanese have probably the most sadistic movies around the world this is one of the strongest examples . a running time at about an hour contains enough sexual violence and gore to disgust every single sane person on earth those who are hunting this type of movies men and a woman are making a porn film . some normally shots are pixelated girl is tied up the madmen cut her food and tong . that make a hole in her abdomen and a man has sexual intercourse with her intestines . is knocked unconscious too and has his penis cut off . special effects are good for an obviously low budget production the tong cut scene looks fake we ca n't talk about acting or screenplay . hearing a lot about this film was very happy when finally found it . first part is pretty boring the second one totally up my mind torture and killing scenes being some of the most extreme and disturbing have ever seen . gore hounds will be satisfied by Tumbling Doll of Flesh'' an unknowing viewer should n't even read the synopsis .
1259_10.txt,1, This is a totally awesome movie ! If you have n't seen it yet you damn well should . Sure the plot is slow to develop the special effects are laughable the acting is ridiculous and the action is badly choreographed but as wrestler DDP would say That's not a bad thing . a good thing ! Everything about this movie is hilarious especially if you get the dubbed version which has even worse actors . It's countless laughs until you get to the end yearning for the sequel where the mummy fights wrestling women . Thus give it ten stars . Unless you're one of those and people with good taste who likes only quality films of the highest calibre recommend this utterly monkeydellic movie !
6275_9.txt,1, Miles O'Keeffe once again assumes the role of the mighty Ator in this the first sequel to the original film . What can say ? This pretty much represents Nirvana ! The plot is ludicrous the script is terrible the acting is hammy throughout the special effects . let's not even go there ! all in all this movie is a veritable delight ! Highlights of the film include Ator and Thong mute companion not his undergarments being attacked by invisible assailants in a cave saved on the fx budget there ! Ator battling what has to be the most unconvincing giant snake ever committed to celluloid and of course the infamous hangliding scene ! There's one question have though . the end of the movie we see a huge atomic explosion when Ator supposedly destroys the Geometric Nucleus the narrator tells us in the hell did Ator destroy it and manage get out alive ? Did he fashion some form of primitive timer or something ? Oh well such an illogical ending really only adds to the movies overall charm they just do n't make them like this anymore !
1617_7.txt,1, In defense of this movie must repeat what had stated previously . The movie is called Arachina it has a no name cast and do not mean no name as in actors who play in little seen art house films . mean no name as in your local high school decided to make a film no name and it might have a dollar budget . So what does one expect ? Hitchcock ? felt the movie never took itself seriously which automatically takes it out of the worst movie list . That list is only for big budget all star cast movies that takes itself way too seriously . THe movie The Oscar comes to mind most of Sylvester Stallone's movies . THe two leads were not Hepburn and Tracy but they did their jobs well enough for this movie . The woman kicked butt and the guy was not a blithering idiot . The actor who played the old man was actually very good . The man who played anal retentive professor was no Clifton Webb but he did a god job . And the Bimbo's for lack of a better were played by two competent actors . laughed at the cent special effects . But that was part of the charm of the movie . It played like a hybrid Tremors meets Night of the Living Dead . The premise of the movie is just like all Giant Bug movies of the Meteor or radiation stir up the ecosystem and before you know it we have Giant Ants Lobsters rocks or Lizards terrorizing the locals . meteor was the cause of the problems this time . was was very entertained . did n't expect much and go a lot more then bargained for .
2881_9.txt,1, Playwright John Osborne's Back in Anger The Entertainer dramatisation of Oscar Wilde's only novel positively revels in the homosexual subtext of the original perhaps too much so .

10581_10.txt,1, Haggard The Movie is the real life story of Ryan Dunn and his girlfriend who cheated on him also with the help from his two friend skate boarder who lives for nothing and trying funny scientist does n't really work played by Bam Margera and Brandom Dicamillo . The film Haggard The Movie also has a lot of the characters from Jackass etc but to say it was written by Bam Margera and Co. this is a very weak attempt seems to me like it was written when he was bored or as a project with they did not pay a lot of attention to . The films also stars Bam's girlfriend Jennifer Rivell who plays Glauren Ryan's girlfriend who basically cheated on him again very bad acting by Jennifer another actor that some people may be interested in is Steve Hellboy played by RakeYohn which his character does not seem to be with the story again bad acting also this character does not really have a lot of lines in this film which basically makes it very boring . but worst of all is Raab's character the voice sound like a smoker who basically has throat cancer also think he could have been improved ! Overall think the characters in this film are n't with the story like in one scene it would be on one certain character a minute later a different scene different character . To say that this is supposed to be a film sort of a documentary its not played by the characters as a documentary the acting makes you think that its a cheap attempt at making a film with your spare time . Towards the middle of the film we start to lose focus on the main character Ryan Dunn although a lot of the attention is on Bam and Brandon . In conclusion this film is OK if you laugh at things that are n't very funny stupid stunts terrible acting and the occasional nude scene ! Also think there there are too many scenes of just no talking and just music !

Expecially a young boy who cant go to school because he could contaminate someone . and the ignorance of the boys who called them FAGGOTS . that just shows how much children are not educated about aids .
6885_7.txt,1, wandered into Blockbuster with a friend the other night having decided that we were too broke and too lazy to do active . She decided she wanted to watch Closer which seemed like such a repellant idea that had to rent another film for once she'd gone to bed . Looking around did n't see much that interested me but saw The Doll Master in the new releases section . Just based on the cover sleeve woman with a doll face crying tears of blood thought this would be interesting enough to rent . As for the film itself watching it in an almost empty house with all the lights turned off it was pretty scary . must admit I've always had a bit of a phobia of dolls since was a kid watched an awful film called Asylum one of the stories in it involved a mental patient creating a doll which killed people . Lame but scary at the time and the first three quarters of this film really hit the spot for me . The first half hour in particular was awesome . The creepy foreboding atmosphere really set the scene well and without moving the dolls seemed genuinely threatening . But unfortunately as soon as they did start to move it all got a bit cheesy was a bit disappointed when moments that could have been genuinely frightening made me laugh because of the way they were filmed . As for the characters it's a horror film you're not really expecting anything memorable . found remembered names and faces better than most Asian horror films I've seen which suggests there must have been some hidden character development that did n't consciously notice . The typical stereotypes are out in force in this movie each one having some kind of character quirk that sets them apart from the others from shy and quiet Yeong and her doll Damien to the outgoing bimbo Seon The plot itself was fairly cool even though the ending which bought together many of the loose strands of plot seemed a bit confused and did n't really do anything for me although it did have a couple of really cool plot that wo n't ruin here . The basic plot is a bunch of kids are invited to be modelled as dolls by a famous reclusive old doll maker they have to stay in the creepy house with scary dolls some big some small and things start to happen as our heroine Hae starts to explore areas of the house and things start happening to the other inhabitants . Overall would definitely recommend the film not to watch with too many people as some of the moments would probably make you laugh if surrounded by friends but as something too watch on your own in the dark with the windows and doors open just a bit just in case any dolls feel like watching with you . It really does leave you guessing for most of the film allowing you to go off on wild conspiracy theories only to completely destroy them later on . If you really get into it and ignore it's cheesiness in places can guarantee you'll check under your bed before you go to sleep and maybe even leave the lights on . Or maybe that's just me As for Closer it was OK but preferred this .
4613_9.txt,1, Good grief sethrp you COMPLETELY missed the point . The girl was only seen briefly specifically BECAUSE she was the one who was going to kill herself . else was so wrapped up in their own stories they did n't notice her nor did we . As one of the other students says at the end we're all so wrapped up in our own problems we do n't notice what's going on for someone else . The director himself said if he had killed off one of the others it would've suggested their problems were worse than someone else's . The whole point of killing Kelly was that she was unnoticed by all of us . Get it now ?

More outrageous friends in OCS but more genuine friends in BOD . Plot was good . You'll predict some of it but even the predictable parts go further than you think they could . So even though this is Better Off Dead's ugly stepsister it's worth a look . See Demi Moore before the plastic surgery if for no other reason . John Cusack fans you got ta see it just to say you have . If you do n't like Bobcat Golthwaite I'm sorry . do n't like him either but you ca n't escape him in this one . At least he does a great job in the film doing a tribute to another movie monster . Editing needed help on the beach but for most part not much to complain about . Overall it's good and funny . But try not to compare it to BOD or you'll find it lacking .
11325_9.txt,1, This lasted several years despite the late hour it was on . Like a lot of crime dramas it looked cold . Both physically and figuratively . This is n't a bad thing though . And the low budget actually worked in it's favor . Gritty during a time when was in . Allan Royal's wraparound segments as the news writer gave it a slight edge . The only actors remembered were Scott Nylands and Tony Rosato The cast of barely knowns was a good thing because one could see the group as a whole and not as a bunch of people supporting a And yes that's a young Clark Johnson in a recurring spot . hope a DVD release is in the future . Someone out there wan na get on that ?
1014_8.txt,1, finally saw LAURE and have to say that equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it . What's great about it is the atmosphere the music the location the cinematography and the beautiful cast . The story is non for sure but with these movies it does n't really matter . The pace in languid and the settings are exotic . The film has a lot going for it . Unfortunately it also has a few things going against it . The first thing is that the gorgeous Annie Belle and the handsome Al Cliver have no chemistry whatsoever . Because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for almost the entire length of the film the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite liability . According to IMDb Al and Annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie . They sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screen . The other problem with LAURE is that some sex scenes are just ineffective or even ridiculous . There's one sex scene that stands out as one of the silliest I've ever seen in any soft porn flick our young blonde couple are picked by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross The pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend and they have an orgy of sorts in the helicopter in mid And Al Cliver is filming all of this with his camera ! kid you not . Ridiculous . We later see that footage being edited on a moviola . While the footage rolls Al and Annie start making out . This scene is actually good but the footage on the screen behind them was at times too much . Watching the footage of the cross getting it on with his bimbo while piloting the helicopter almost had me rolling on the floor laughing out loud . Is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way ? The last thing want to see is a woman pleasuring a man in drag certainly when the man in drag makes for such an ugly woman while piloting a helicopter no less . Al and Annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene . just wish the footage on the editing screen was n't so silly . Speaking of drag another dull plot point in LAURE which really drags the movie to a crawl are all those moments with the great Orso Maria Guerrini and his two wives . married threesome is an interesting idea but it hardly registers here as hot or even interesting . The two women are sorta dull and we rarely see the three having sex . In fact Orso keeps his clothes on for almost the entire film even when he's with Annie Belle . This is another minor complaint about LAURE there's nudity but it's not as much as other films of the same era . It just needed more skin to punch it up . Except for those minor complaints and the drag queen moments LAURE is actually very watchable . love these kind of softcore films from the when the attention was set on mood and atmosphere not the crude stuff we see today . make sure to watch Emanuelle in Egypt which stars Annie Al but also another famous screen couple Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti . The music in that movie is also great .
11045_8.txt,1, Viewing both of these films concurrently is not a bad idea to get a sense of early film production and acting for the camera styles . give the nod to Garbo not by much regard to her naturalness . Robeson is majestic . But his performance is aimed for a large proscenium theater . Something else that struck me was the movies themes of empowerment for women and minorities . There had n't been any films coming out of Hollywood yet that allowed the voices of marginal characters like Anna and Brutus to take the foreground . These were very progressive films for their time . It's quite probable that O'Neill saw the writing on the wall way before everyone else did about the future of America .
12378_7.txt,1, Jack Frost is probably the most cheesiest movie have ever seen in my life . The complete title of the film is Jack Frost Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman . Horror movie fans that have a taste for campy story lines will be delighted to watch this . This film was straight to video and for good reasons . Here's why The acting was so atrocious and so terrible that it could cause one to cry . The main character had no personality and the actor's bad acting made it all worse . The screenplay was was also atrocious . Each character always says a cheesy line and add the cheesy lines to the bad choreography then you have something bad . Second the story line is n't really all that impressive but since this movie was straight to video it is forgiven . The director and writer could have turned the idea of a killer snowman into something cool but they did n't . They story has lots of plot holes in it . In the beginning a cup of coffee gets knocked into the fish tank with the melted Jack Frost . Scientists try to restore his life but they could n't . Once the cup of coffee fell into the tank Jack Frost was completely restored . Now he is immune to anti In Jack Frost part the main character's DNA got mixed up with the Anti that was used to kill Jack Frost . Since the main character is allergic to bananas Jack Frost is too . Hence here's my point . They say that Sam's DNA combined with Jack Frost's . But one of the scientists had some saliva on the cup so when it fell into the tank the scientists DNA would have been combined with Jack Frosts . Another thing the special effects were n't very good either . Here's the good points Jack Frost has lots of blood that looks pretty realistic . Even though this movie is flawed to hell it is still entertaining . Overall Jack Frost is an enjoyable horror movie . The first one was better though . out of
7355_8.txt,1, Low budget mostly no name actors . this is what a campy horror flick is supposed to be all about . These are the types of movies that kept me on the edge of my seat as a kid staying up too late to watch cable . If you liked the horror scene this is the movie for you .
11246_10.txt,1, The fact that reviewers feel very intensely negative towards the show is an interesting fact all its own . If you dislike it so much do n't watch it . Certain reviewers assert that you have to be dumb dim or plain old primitive to enjoy this show . Au contraire my friends . am not claiming that all the contestants are smart . There are smart ones and there are dumb ones . But WOULD argue that they probably have a higher average IQ than the average reviewer on this website . Thats right said it . There is a lot to be said for the science of seducing girls . I'm sorry but please withdraw all sticks out of your asses and realize the reason you hate these guys is that they threaten you . Those oblivious to social sciences and more specifically the science behind mating are clearly going to miss the boat completely . One thing is clear The clubs are n't the only places to meet girls . personally think that the worthwhile women do n't even go to clubs so that they wo n't fall prey to men like the ones we see on the show . But what are men like these ? Apart from the ones whose games stink they are the epitome of men . They are men who meet women in the most difficult situations . These are men who take ownership of their own sexuality . These men do n't beg for their girlfriends to not break up with them and these men do n't say OK'' to the phrase let's just be friends'' Sound familiar ? In fact these are the very guys you're afraid of when you take your special long term girlfriend to the club . We all are . These guys know what women like . only the ones who have game'' And even the ones who are bad . are worth a laugh ! If you have gone out to a club and actually interacted with the people around you you should find this show entertaining . Look am at a loss for why there is so much hate for this show . My best guess is that it aggravates the insecurity in men who have had bad experiences in clubs or threatens men who believe women are beautiful self creatures who just want a nice guy to buy their attention . personally love this show . It is pure entertainment and best of all its REAL . It is a very perceptive take on the most recent state of sexual psychology . Sex roles have never been so different from before and this show provides a very real view of that think it actually takes some intelligence to take away something positive from this show . This show appeals to a certain target market and if you're outside of that then guess you should n't tune in to the show . We could say this about any other shows though could n't we ?

8751_10.txt,1, Contains spoilers had it recorded a while ago when it was on PBS but never got a chance to watch it due to prejudice about having to sit through hrs of Masterpiece Theater with its BBC made for TV production style music settings all in one room no outdoor scenes flat TV look . But after watching the movie Traffic thought was pretty good at that time could n't help digging up the Traffik tape to see what else could they have dwelled into with the extra hr . Boy was my preconceptions wrong about this TV series . It is so much more involving than Traffic . The characters are fleshed out better so that their actions are more believable . And the whole subplot involving Pakistan completes the whole point of view of everyone in the whole supply chain from the farmer to the end user . In Traffic the Pakistan story was rewritten and reduced down to a good cop vs bad cop plot . There was alot more meaningful discussion and debate about alcohol and other forms of drug whereas in Traffic they mostly became passing references of no significance . Same with social issues which in Traffik were conveyed realistically sounding preachy . Whereas in Traffic the characters jus blurted it out as a statement like the way they do it in those made for TV issue of the week'' movies . There was no bad guy vs good guy in Traffik even the dealer is portrayed as a junkie that sells to support his habit instead of the nobody messes with me'' type of person in Traffic . The only down part is that since watched Traffic not much before watching this it was hard not to compare scene by scene and even though the scenes were not the same knew what the outcome was going to be already . Thank god for the Pakistan story which is different enough that it allowed me to enjoy it completely thinking which scene it compares to . Although was thrown off thinking the drugs were fused into the ceramic of the statues in which Helen brought back to Germany in the storyline of Traffic . Thank god Traffik was not that hokey and far
10550_8.txt,1, This is a funny movie there's not a lot of those . OK the plot is a bit disturbing but very original . teen trying to get even with dad because he has n't been around and almost sending him to jail because she lie to impress an older boy how could that not be funny ? Plus it not the typical movie featuring teens . First remake i've seen that is better than the original the only problem with both Gerard Depardieu . With another actor this would be a perfect because he plays all rolls the same way sucks . Another problem it's all the women melting over him that's not remotely believable he is not attractive ! had a rubber troll that was better looking than him come on !
6697_7.txt,1, mixture of Alien and Ghost Busters ? Starts very promising then slows down to almost boring . LifeForce contains some awesome special effects they were able to make in the mid The story is intriguing but becomes quite lack lustre in the end . It was rated because of the nudeness sex and gore . Mathilda May's ethereal and savage beauty is very apparent through out the whole movie . bizarre movie and cost a lot by the time it was made . This could have been a bigger classic with a better script but unfortunately it was n't a great hit think it actually flopped quite bad . So something went wrong with this one but still it's very entertaining .
346_7.txt,1, Sherri . an evening of Pleasure and Terror ! Cheap special effects lines its the original Movie Sherri Starting Geoffrey Land as Peter Desmond Jill Jacobson as Sherri Martin and Directed by Al Adamson . The movie is about an evil ancient spirit that possesses a nurse at a hospital she starts killing doctors one by one . acting was okay but some of the acting was robotic . storyline was good but the sex scenes were just thrown in there probably to get more views . directing was bad the special effects looked like a drawing effects did n't fool anybody . death scenes were pretty good but the director mixed too many things in there that did n't make any sense like the sex scenes nudity football player many more . Overall Its Good Movie Not The Best . Out Of
9316_7.txt,1, Purportedly made back to back with Nights of the Living Dead with the same cast and setting but for certain this one does not have Laura Gemser . Much derided by all rather like this movie . Sure enough the storyline and dialogue are codswallop but this is so beautifully filmed in such a marvellous setting and actually like the hardcore . find it at once naturalistic and exotic and that does n't just mean there is a black girl and some limp penises ! find the numerous and varied sex scenes very believable even if two are set upon a tree trunk at the edge of the ocean with the waves constantly splashing around . The creature does not deign to appear until half hour before the end and is it has to be said a disappointment . Still in the time remaining he manages to kill off all but two of the expedition and in the case of the girls having sex with them first afterwards in at least one case ! and this film is not as slow as some maintain . Moreover there are some fine moments of sexploitation not least the lady scientist and her urge for two and the glorious finale when the two survivors speed off in their boat gaze back at the island they have escaped from and find there is still time for one last act of copulation .
3706_10.txt,1, Mom should really be given a different title to distinguish it from all the other movies out there called Mom or with the word Mom in the title . This is a vastly superior zombie movie to so much of the rubbish that gets churned out time after time and all end up much the same as every other zombie movie out there . It is so different and refreshing it almost defies categorisation . The kind old lady who takes in a creepy lodger who just happens to be a flesh eater who then infects the old lady who also turns into a flesh eating zombie or ghoul quite which exactly is not defined . There is pathos in the story as her son realises what she has become and while at first horrified attempts to help her by supplying shall say no more about that for fear of inserting a spoiler ! It is one of those movies as opposed to guns blasting explosions raging car chases etc boring etc that makes so many movies all the same rubbish but still with enough gory moments to satisfy horror fans whilst also inserting sadness into the story along with nice touches of humour as opposed to downright silliness of some so movies . There is a particularly nice atmospheric shot at the beginning of the film where the old lady is sitting alone in her room with only her Christmas tree for company and looks so but what she becomes ! Oh my ! gem of a movie and even if not your thing should at least be viewed if only once by any true horror fan .
4249_7.txt,1, Sure the film is full of black militant stereotypes and much of the jargon of the time . In that sense the movie has indeed dated . But as a satirical look at America's number one parasitical industry advertising it's still on target . But just as important is the counter message namely the effect of big bucks on those who would make the industry more socially responsible promoting war toys alcohol etc . Thus the movie's also about the allures of capitalism . Note for example how Putney's garb suddenly changes to resemble Third revolutionary Fidel's just before he pulls out of the firm . For a moment it looks like Swope's mini has succeeded among his staff and he's moving on maybe to spread the movement . But then the former militants succumb to the allure of big bucks and he departs shaking his head perhaps to hijack a plane to Cuba . Downey's final word however is an ironical one as the Arab believe burns down the money tower leaving the metaphorical structure of capitalism a smoking ruin . To me this looks like change can only succeed as a cleansing act of destruction and not as a process of reform message consistent with the radical spirit of the time . Whatever the subtext there are some genuinely funny moments especially with the commercials that play as well now as they did then . Those who compare the anarchic style to that of the Marx Bros. make a good point . The throw lines fly thick and fast along with the outrageous set Forty years later it's still a hard movie to get a consistent handle on . Despite the crudities however the film remains a work of daring originality with some genuinely telling moments .
8707_7.txt,1, Subspecies like many other horror films gets a raw deal on IMDb . The majority of movie have a hearty contempt for horror and when they occasionally rent horror films they either want to laugh at them or cringe at excessively gory scenes . Unfortunately Subspecies'' is not particularly laughable and not that bloody so it gets a low rating . That's too bad . Of course there's plenty to criticize here . The non are flat the subspecies are a poor special effect and the nighttime scenes are too brightly lit . But what do you expect ? For a straight horror film Subspecies'' boasts decent production values and more integrity than you might anticipate . The film's Romanian setting is virtually unique believe it was the first American movie made in that country post and the locations both interior and exterior are beautiful . The script has moments of intelligence especially when it delves into local folklore bogus I'm sure Somehow the location filming and smartish script work well together Subspecies'' has its own very distinctive world . To risk damning with faint praise . could be a lot dumber . Fans of the more gruesome aspects of horror will no doubt get a kick out of the blood vampire villain Radu . He's pretty effective in this movie powerful with a memorable raspy voice but like him better in the sequels when actor Anders Hove gives a more self campy performance . totally sincere Radu is somewhat silly . Other silly aspects include gratuitous nudity and the subspecies themselves who are clearly only in the movie because producer Charles Band has a fetish for evil little creatures also Puppetmaster and Demonic Toys But linger too much on the movie's flaws . For what it is straight vampire horror Subspecies'' is perfectly fine . The sequels boast better production values more violence and somewhat more thoughtful story lines so recommend them even more highly . Still this is n't a bad start for the series .
644_8.txt,1, just finished this movie and my only comment is OH ! WOW ! Jennifer Beals is ok as the fiancee but Yancy Butler as the female dance instructor is pure sexual dynamite ! Having watched her in WITCHBLADE was not prepared for the pure unadulterated sensuality and raw sexual excitement she launches onto the screen . got ta see THIS movie again . only for Yancy Butler as Corrinne !
11080_10.txt,1, The Falcon and the Snowman is based on a true story . Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee titular traitors played by Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn received their code names from the KGB . Why ? Boyce was an avid falconer and Lee was a coke head . The movie is based on a true story . It's based on the book of the same name . Another reviewer asked what was their motivation ? Disillusionment it ai n't . Ideology it ai n't . my bad grammar but I'm making a point here . What was it if it was n't disillusionment or ideology ? In a word greed . By the time of the Boyce case money became the great motivator and not ideology . Do n't believe me ? Then look at the Walker Family Spy Ring which was broken in the late Three spies did the worst damage to our national security in the and John Walker who began his career as a spy in the Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee . All three sold out this country for thirty pieces of silver . If you are n't familiar with that phrase suggest you read the Bible .
4311_7.txt,1, Nicely filmed a little uneven Nobody'' is a good evening's entertainment . The plot is simple enough yuppies get into a scrap with a group of strangers in a bar and it turns out to be much more than they bargained for . The acting is decent and there are a few unexpected twists . Watch for the completely unbelievable the shot revolver and shot semi handgun
6861_7.txt,1, horror picture set ultimately to parody but still in it's play out could scare a few of those that are frailed nerved or easily disgusted when they see whats under their skin . laughed at it though . It was easy to decipher the true killer and his acting did n't help . This only led to Potente looking even better . Anatomie is not much of a horror picture for those foreign of the genre but those contained should get a few unintentional laughs and an interesting peak at German horror cinema .
12138_7.txt,1, Pulling in million viewers one has to wonder what everyone's opinions on the storyline is . Reading the run down over at lifetime was led to believe that this would be an edge thriller about a single mother being stalked and finally confronting the stalker . Sadly was mistaken . While the main plot is interesting enough Single mother run off road one night then is stalked by same guy the reasoning behind the stalking left nothing but a really bad taste in my mouth . Laura Leighton plays the victim and she does it well . Whether it was all those years on Melrose Place or not she does well in this movie playing a mother who would do anything to protect her son from harm and she's looking pretty good too these days . Leighton is really the only good thing about this movie . think many people will identify with the main character after discovering why the stalker is stalking it will be a view type of movie .
4134_7.txt,1, I've got to say it . Gary Busey saved this film . If it were not for his fine acting talents this film would have been sub par . recommend the film but just barely . The biggest difficulty with the film is its broad disregard for historical geographical and physical accuracy . For example why is Lubbock green and hilly ? How come Buddy's producer Petty ignored ? Where are the daily trips to the Clovis New Mexico studio ? Why is Nashville treated as a racist hate camp out to destroy the Holly sound ? Why was Buddy's two week courtship to Maria treated as a complex taboo race mixing stereotype ? Why are Buddy's tile boxes as light as feathers ? Finally why are the Crickets portrayed as trouble making roadblocks to Holly's talent ? Taken on their face these inaccuracies should spell doom for any film proclaiming itself The Buddy Holly Story . However Busey does deliver a stirring portrayal as the man whose death eventually led to the day the music died .
7108_8.txt,1, House of Dracula'' is a good sequel to House of Frankenstein'' There is n't as much action but the acting is just as good .

11449_8.txt,1, bunch of mostly obnoxious and grossly unappealing teens go to a creepy remote rundown old mortuary located nearby a cemetery to attend an anything all Halloween party being hosted by freaky occult oddball Mimi Kinkade and her vacuous boy bimbette friend Linnea Quigley . The loutish profane beer sex dipstick dimwits hold a as a joke bad idea the desolate old dive is naturally said to be haunted by demonic spirits Of course that ill awakens those decidedly grumpy and hostile evil spirits who gruesomely kill and possess a majority of the kids turning them into ugly fanged clawed boil murderous ghouls who wreak the usual grisly havoc throughout the duration of an especially long dark and harrowing night of pure terror . Yep this is essentially your umpteenth vigorously graphic and unrelenting wall cheap shock Evil Dead'' rehash replete with closed there's no easy way out claustrophobic single self setting outrageously excessive splatter set pieces an incessantly pounding hum'n synthesizer score a total sense of gloom'n grim nightmarishness and vibrantly in manic careening cinematography expected headlong rush hyperactive hand camera smooth sinuous tracking shots crazily tittled camera angles even the camera on a dolly doing a gracefully gliding degree figure eight Fortunately Kevin Tenney's slick assured stylish direction keeps the extremely threadbare and derivative proceedings thundering along at a speedy clip moreover Tenny gives the film an attractive polished look and effectively creates a certain crudely energetic and enthusiastically grotesque spooky ooga carnival funhouse atmosphere . However Steve Johnson's marvelously gory and imaginative make effects are the true star of the show . Bloodthirsty highlights include disgusting fat slob Hal Havins played a similarly irritating obese role in the immortal Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl around the same time having his tongue bitten off Quigley shoving a whole tube of lipstick in one of her breasts and gouging a guy's eyes out while she's making love to him yow ! a libidinous teen couple getting offed while doing exactly what you think in a coffin chick has her neck snapped while the dude has his arm chopped off Kinkade setting her hands on fire and in the film's single most nasty scene a mean old man has his throat slit from the inside out after eating an apple piece laced with razor blades . The trashy'n rock score likewise smokes . And then there's Kinkade's incredibly wild sexy and uninhibited demon dance a sizzling number accompanied by a flickering strobe light and startling jump cuts that Kinkade choreographed herself . Okay so this overall does n't amount to anything more than a completely mindless and pointless albeit quite nicely mounted and enjoyably vulgar hunk of blithely sleazy fright flick junk but if you're in the mood for entertainingly brain lowbrow horror scuzziness this cheerfully crass and juvenile dross does the trick just fine .
8887_9.txt,1, We're living in sad times today in which it seems like every comedy movie and TV show is painfully unfunny and inflicted with cheap crude or poor humor . Most people do n't know what it means to really laugh at a comedy and these people desperately need to watch Throw Momma From the Train . say with little hesitation that this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen from beginning to end . The comedy is so unpredictable and twisted just enough to make us laugh out loud many times throughout . Do n't be fooled by the murder plot . The plot is not serious enough to make us care or worry about what's going to happen . The story involves a young man DeVito who wants to get rid of his annoying grouchy mother Ramsey nominated for an Oscar in a role that was completely flawless in my opinion and does so by killing off Billy Crystal's wife whom Crystal wanted dead for stealing his novel . do n't want to spoil the jokes and gags in this film but all can say is that you must see this film if you want to laugh . Fast and genuinely a real treat to comedy lovers and the type of film you just do not see today . out of
9380_9.txt,1, Never has the words hidden gem'' been so accurate . Bad movie lovers might search all over for the next hidden obscurity sometimes coming up short with stuff like Weasels rip my flesh but other times luck will prevail and you might end up with something like Death Bed then hopefully realizing it's not a bad movie at all it just has a bad title and not even a bad title but a humorous one that might throw you off but Somehow Death Bed still fits into the bad'' category . With a vibe that's somber and empty Death Bed is a true masterpiece of low horror reserved only for those fortunate enough to appreciate such a dark shadow of a vision . Death Bed involves an incoherent yet intriguing relationship between a demon in the bed and the sympathetic ghost trapped in the portrait who only wishes he could spare someone from the awful fate of being devoured by the yellow suds . Although not all that scary considering it's about a killer bed Death Bed possesses the qualities that make for successful horror . dark desolate vibe confusion an eerie subtle score and that dream quality that this masterpiece almost flaunts . Such a quality or vibe usually seems unintentional . Not only is it intentional but from what I've read Death Bed is based on an actual dream George Barry the director successfully transferred dream to film only a genius could accomplish such a task . Old mansions make for good quality horror as do portraits not sure what to make of the killer bed with its killer yellow liquid quite a bizarre dream indeed . Also this is n't quite the brand of was expecting considering the title and all . Before viewing this Gothic gem expected something more like Class Reunion Massacre now thats a bad movie if you've seen it you know what I'm saying . After considering all of the above feel like Death Bed deserves only eight stars but since it stayed so obscure for so long We'll say the bed that eats deserves nine .

12463_10.txt,1, There is absolutely no doubt that this version of Tarzan is the closest to Burroughs vision . While he gladly collected his royalties from the films produced during his lifetime he frequently made it clear that they were little more than the bastard children of his tales . The film studios ludicrous obsession with casting Olympic swimmers as Tarzan was beyond laughable . guess we should consider ourselves lucky that they did not set their sights on shot Prior to this film the most faithful adaptations were in comic strips and comic books . As fine as some of these were we had to wait seven decades for a filmmaker with the integrity to respect the character as he had been created .

Two guys compete against each other to get a girl's phone number . Simple . The fun in this show is watching the two males try to accomplish their goal . Some appear to hate the show for various reasons but think they misunderstood this as an educational'' show on how to pick up chicks . Well it is not it is a comedy show and the whole point of it is to make you laugh not teach you anything . If you did n't like the show because it does n't teach you anything do n't watch it . If you do n't like the whole clubbing thing do n't watch it . If you do n't like socializing do n't watch it . This show is a comical show . If you down by watching others pick up girls well its not making you laugh so do n't watch it . If you are so disappointed in yourself after watching this show and realizing that you do n't have the ability to pick girls there is no reason to hate the show simply do n't watch it !
5270_10.txt,1, consider this movie as one of the most interesting and funny movies of all time . It has so much highly intelligent thoughts in it that anybody who thinks the movie is awful did not get it and is not able to recognize really deep philosophical themes which are in it all the Schneider movies without a doubt . Several universities in germany and throughout europe have made studies on Schneider's way of seeing things . By the way Helge Schneider is a very intelligent and sensitive person and on of the Jazz in germany europe He is mostly inspired by the great and So if you do not like him it is ok but please do not try to convince others that he might be stupid cheap boring or not funny . Because if you had to face this opinion in a discussion and if you are willing to really look into the art of you would have to surrender''
11993_10.txt,1, One of the most interesting things is that this film is highly touted as an only sequel . There's nothing wrong with that except this The return of Chevy Chase as Ty Webb . This connects the viewer to this character the original Caddyshack in and makes fans thinking or wanting Caddyshack II to be similar to the first one . There are rumors that Rodney Dangerfield was supposed to return . He carried a big part of the first film so his return would have put Caddyshack over the top . Jackie Mason is the Rodney for this movie and does a decent job even though their comic deliveries are way different . Dan Aykroyd was great but not in the film enough . He should have been involved to the tune of how much screen time Bill Murray got in the first one . Robert Stack was good in the Ted Knight role . miss you Ted ! Danny Noonan should have been back . So many others could have returned to show us what happened to their characters eight years later . Bushwood should not have undergone the total makeover it did . Instead the characters involved rather than the club itself should have been the main focus like they were in the first one . When you watch this film keep in mind that it is n't a major sequel and you may think it's another good or bad eighties comedy . Fans of the first should see it but do n't be shocked when the comparisons between the original and Part II are so far apart .
8890_7.txt,1, deliciously nasty black comedy about a middle schlub DeVito who wants to bump off his mother and hatches a plan to do so with a bitter divorc who wants to bump off HIS ex The movie is completely unapologetic in its cynicism and gives us no one to like but for once that works in the movie's favor rather than as a turn off . Anne Ramsey as DeVito's battle axe mom steals the show in a grotesquely funny performance . Even though she's a horror you end up rooting for her because it seems like she could kick both DeVito's and Crystal's asses at the same time with both hands tied behind her back . Grade
9826_8.txt,1, Why do people need to follow the opinion of the herds of masses and critics ? RANDOM HEARTS directed by the brilliant Sydney Pollack has a small role in the film too is another Harrison Ford vehicle . As such it is quite good and entertaining . Surely anyone who goes to see it has this in mind or read the book which is no better . Even Kristin Scott Thomas fans myself included knew it would be a variation of her again playing the love interest of her eldest uncle . Even as such the film is satisfying . What's so bad about this movie that is much better in the other higher rated Harrison Ford vehicles ? This film is no masterpiece but it's not as bad as the masses would have the potential viewer believe .
8826_8.txt,1, Every time the supposed explorers and we the audience is primed to set its first sights one of the wonderous new worlds for some ungodly reason the filmmakers decided to distract with an emergency'' or some false alarm or some bit of artificial dramatic suspense . So instead of calmly enjoying the surface of Io or standing over the rings of Saturn or concentrating on the magic of flying by a comet or an asteroid we are distracted into worrying about the wellbeing and survival of the characters . Big let down The filmmakers seem to be unsure what they want . documentary of the natural wonders in our solar system or a suspense thriller in which the viewer cares more about the characters than the subject matter . Come on . Hello . If wanted suspense and tension I'd watch a real Narrative sci movie . Sure it's a docu But the characters and their survival here risks of such a mission should be secondary to the subject matter Wait . Yes the risks of such a mission are an important part of the subject matter since essentially this is a film about a space mission not just about the solar system . But it was overplayed and distracted strongly from the discovery of new worlds we were supposed to be enjoying . Otherwise the film was remarkable in giving a very realistic feel for the human elements of a space mission the squabbles the tensions the weight of responsibility the near mistakes the sacrifices etc . Also it would fit very well in the hard subgenre in fact it would be one of the best because here the science was almost closely adhered to . But the distractions were awful . Otherwise missed showing the effects of being in space for several years on the astronauts AFTER landing on Earth . Also not
5756_9.txt,1, Okay this may not be the most sophisticated movie you'll ever see . Actually there is n't a bit of sophisticatedlyness'' in it . It's puerile adolescent inoffensive idiotic . utterly hilarious . Basically Richie and Eddie run the worst hotel in Britain . Cue some ridiculous antics with the guests while they beat each other up try to get the rent money out of the only resident who is daft enough to stay have an all night drinking binge with the boys from the power plant next door . fall in lust with the beautiful actress who comes to stay to avoid the press . Give it a try if you're a fan of Rik and Ade and their work . If you're not . get the movie . Simple as that . not being thick this is a word from another one of Rik's fab jaunts into the movie world
11260_10.txt,1, What can say ? could n't sleep and came across this movie on MTV . started watching it with every intention of changing the channel if it started to get lame as so many anti movies do but got sucked into this movie and could n't stop watching . Nick Stahl did an amazing job with his character and in my opinion he really made the movie something worth watching . was interested in purchasing the soundtrack to the movie even the movie itself and MTV . was no help at all but believe it or not Amazon . is taking pre for the August release of the movie on DVD . know had a hard time tracking it down and I'm sure other people might have had the same problem . I'm buying my own copy so can drool over Nick Stahl while bawling my eyes out at the same time thanks to the emotional storyline !
10357_7.txt,1, Brain of Blood starts as Abdul Amir Hadley the leader of a country called Kahlid is close to death because of cancer however if he dies Kahlid will tear itself apart without anyone to lead them so doctor Robert Nigserian Williams one of Amir's devotees Mohammed Vorkov have devised a plan to take Amir's dead body to America where mad scientist Dr. Lloyd Trenton Taylor will transplant his brain into a fresh body with a bit of plastic surgery no will ever know he was even dead . Things do n't go according to plan though as when the time comes to transplant Amir's brain Trenton's freak assistant Gor Bloom brings a dead body of someone that fell from a balcony Trenton needed a strong fit living body since there's no more time he decides to use Gor's body as a temporary stop until another more suitable one can be found . Unfortunately when Amir wakes up in his new body he's not very happy at what he sees mean would you be if you found out your brain was inside a badly burned freak ? Also known as Brain Damage The Brain The Creature's Revenege The Undying Brain this cheapo exploitation flick was produced directed by the one only Al Adamason quite frankly I'm offended at the pathetic rating Brain of Blood has on the IMDb personally think it's terrific fun in a so bad it's good sort of way . The highly entertaining script by Kane Lynn Joe Van Rodgers is as loopy silly as they come from sloppy blood soaked brain transplants to crazed mad scientists from foot tall acid scarred freaks who play with toy cars to foot tall midget medical assistant's from basement dungeons to rooftop chases from car crashes to assassination's kidnaps to screaming scantily clad women from Regina Carrol's hair which should get it's own mention during the opening credits to teenage girls imprisoned in the basement for blood to a laugh hilarious ending which includes some deep meaningful speech ! It's all here Brain of Blood has quality cheese stamped all over it if your a fan of bad low budget exploitation flicks with a sense of fun then this film should be right at the top of your list of see films . Despite it's lowly rating am proud to admit that liked Brain of Blood a lot thought it was an absolute hoot to watch it slows down a bit at the end with a few too many shots of people wandering around doing nothing in particular but until that point it had moved along like a rocket at only minutes it's relatively short it's difficult to second guess the barmy plot just think it's loads of campy fun . This is director Adamson's masterpiece as far as I'm concerned along with Dracula vs. Frankenstein which he made a year before this . Those who have seen an Adamson film before will know about the none existent production values cheap special effects cardboard sets that all adds to the fun this film manages that fine between incompetence seriousness to create a memorable viewing experience . love the opening shot of Kahlid which is obviously just a photo of the Taj Mahal in India complete with statuesque people in the foreground ! Regina Carrol's hair seems to be a separate entity on it's own it seems to change styles between shots is frankly horrendous do n't get me started about her make job either that she must apply with a a paint sprayer ! There is another hilarious moment when we see Amir's body has been transported to America wrapped in what looks like ordinary tin foil why is the question asked myself why ! The effects are variable there's a terrible looking fake spider Gor's burned make job is pretty bad although there is a surprisingly gory brain removal which is actually quite impressive . The budget for Brain of Blood must have been practically none existent must admit thought Trenton's lab was quite good with various computers medical instruments although the rest of the film looks cheap nasty . The production values are low the music was taken from another film Beast of Blood the acting is awful but in a campy fun sort of way . Brain of Blood may have the best title for an exploitation film ever as far as I'm concerned it's a highly entertaining piece of nonsense that had a great time watching laughing at . They just do n't make them like this anymore impossible to recommend to anyone looking for a good film but bad movie lovers should enjoy it . liked it but then again I'm just weird .
4659_10.txt,1, have no idea what the budget on this movie was but whatever it was they made it work ! have seen movies that spend the amount Harbor anyone ? and sucked worse . This movie has everything . David Makin It'' Naughton in the lead role as Adam an average college student who gets wrapped up in a game called the Great AllNighter'' run by Leon ! This guy rocks ! genius'' with nothing better to do than come up with an elaborate game for a bunch of people to play . But he does n't just pick his friends . He has a team of Jocks nerds fatties average kids and of course Flounder's team who are the bad guys'' But this movie has no black and white . There are many shades of gray . Adam is not the altruistic hero with no faults . He treats Alex like crap . AND Flounder is the way he is because of pressures from his Dad and a cranky stomach . The jocks play dirty but so does everyone else ! This movie rocks ! The scene at the PBR factory ? Classic ! Johnny's Obese Male Child ? Can you write a better clue ? This stuff is gold Jerry ! GOLD ! Maybe am from a different generation but love movies that seem far but still have roots in reality . This never happened . it could . Eeeee EEEE . Bunny . Parade ! Oh and watch for a young Paul Rubens still working on that Pee wee character . PS That Devra Clinger WAS HOT ! She must have been one bad actress not to work in Hollywood anymore . SEE THIS MOVIE !
11357_7.txt,1, I'm from Ireland and thought this film had the odd minute or two where accents where a little off but no worse than any Brad Pitt or other American doing the accent . Furthermore have rarely seen any British actor handle an American or Canadian accent except for Colin Farrel in Minority Report . This film is a little film and it was entertaining . No it was n't a Blockbuster Hollywood production but frankly I'm sick of that shite . laughed more than a few times and had a good time . It was definitely worth the rental . The main character is a spoof on other hard British gangsters . At least that's the way saw it . If you go in expecting a million dollar production you'll be disappointed . Enjoy it for what it is a small entertaining film .
753_7.txt,1, Nurse Charlotte Beale lovely Rosie Holotik arrived to Dr. Stephens clinic for the insane prepared for a new job . What she does n't expect is to find another supposed doctor in his position after Stephens is attacked by axe maniacal judge'' Oliver Cameron a running gag anytime he confronts a situation out of his control he retreats to repeating his name That doctor is Geraldine Masters Weenick is n't sure about whether Beale is a proper fit for their establishment . After a long discussion about the position is quite an awkward scene as the two debate about Beale's being sent a letter by Stephens getting a job at the clinic with Masters often reminding her that he is no longer in charge agrees to let her work in the nursing position but the good Doctor may not be who she seems . The assortment of loonies includes Sam McGee simple child who was Stephens last victim of lobotomy Jennifer Warren woman who needs an adult to comfort her as she wallows at Masters heel like a puppy Danny Kirby trouble annoyance often trying to steal the fake baby of disturbed Harriet Carr Allyson Chandler sexy nympho who just wants to be loved and hops at any man she sees Sergeant'' Jaffee Feagin typical case of soldier who has n't escaped the madness of war . The film shows Masters unorthodox methods of running the clinic with allowing the patients to roam free with the doors to all rooms without locks calling into question . not to mention the fact that Oliver is still allowed to walk around despite just chopping Dr. Stephens with an axe . And what exactly happened to Dr. Stephens ? Ah ha . Tacky drive trash is a lot of fun if you are into a warped brand of cinema . I'm attracted to bizarre flicks about mental rejects because of their unpredictable nature . just never know what the hell might happen especially in this case where they are allowed to roam often unattended . Some consider the low budget a liability but in the case of this film think it enhances the experience . With the cheap photography and weak production values shot for peanuts in a run down house in some awful location seems creepier and felt like a voyeur peering into insanity through a camera lens on the outside looking in .
5525_7.txt,1, The title refers not to a questionable poker hand but to six comic players . They come in twos Charles Ruggles and Mary Boland as a couple driving to California for a second honeymoon George Burns and Gracie Allen as another couple who go along to share expenses and Fields and Alison Skipworth as a sheriff and a hotel in a tiny Nevada town . No attempt is made to fashion a coherent narrative a collection of comic bits strung together . All the first couple want to do is spend time together but Burns and Allen's characters are n't married so the men bunk together as do the women . There is a bit of a plot a bad guy plants in the suitcase Pinky is taking out of town but because the expedition is being guided by Gracie the loot can not be found . The bad guy shows up in Nevada and Fields accidentally captures him . bunch of pleasant bits Ruggles confused expression Gracie's batty breakneck talk and Fields playing billiards with a corkscrew cue and doing a fluttery craven backwards double when he's threatened and his wonderfully distinctive way of lingering over words . And trying to remember the name Gracie he tells Skipworth Hmm . Starts with a McGonigle . She answers Oh no no no no . Mmmm . Wangahanky ! No no no no no . Oh Gracie . Yes that's right .
8777_10.txt,1, Hitchcock once gave an interview where he said he like to direct screenplays that had an ordinary person minding their own business who's accidentally caught up in an awful chain of events that they ca n't get out of until the dastardly plot that's behind their troubles is resolved . That way the audience can feel more sympathy for the hero . We certainly do in this fine film . Barry Kane is only trying to help his fellow out by performing acts of kindness and consideration like helping Fry pick up the letters he dropped at the factory . Barry even returns a lost bill to Fry later on . was BIG money in It's Barry's acts of Christian kindness that get him into trouble and soon he's wrongly accused of sabotage and murder and will likely hang if he ca n't clear himself . Similar to The Steps in plot the hero travels cross where he discovers plans for further acts of terrorism by fascisistic cells an arch who nobody could believe to be a closet and a beautiful blonde Patricia Martin who first suspects and hates then eventually falls in love with Barry Kane . Hitch's trademark touches of humor are here too . Patricia is a billboard model who's various roadside ads are a help and comfort to Barry as he hitches a ride with the bad guys all the way from Las Vegas to NYC . We meet a trucker who's a one comedy act Someone convinced my wife it was stylish to eat three meals a day . Field employees of the fascist spy ring grouse about being forgotten or ignored by the suits'' just as if they were working for some legit enterprise . During a chase scene into a cinema audience members laugh at the action of a schlocky comedy flick as the saboteur cell shoots it out for real with the good guys and accidentially kills a guffawing movie Awful for the dead old man but funny ! Hitch liked to use famous monuments in his movies and this is the best instance with the Statue of Liberty as backdrop and ironic icon ! It works even better than the Mt Rushmore scene in NBNW .
10543_7.txt,1, Perhaps the best movie ever made by director Kevin Tenney his Witchboard is not on the top of my all horror list this one is a strange fascinating mixture between Pin and Child's Play both better than this one but not so better . Sure the plot is contrived and perhaps too predictable but the actors are good Rosalind Allen is very pleasant to the eye so is Candance McKenzie God bless her for the shower scene ! the child actress is very good in interpreting the disturbed daughter and the Pinocchio puppet is scary enough to give you a few thrills down the spine . For a not bad at all .

That's right Walk outside your mom's basement that you've been living in for years and GO OUTSIDE . But ca n't leave ! Star Trek is on in minutes and still have n't married that avatar on World Of Warcraft ! Oh my God in that case stay inside ! Alright might have gone overboard there . mean Star Trek is okay but do n't really watch it that much anymore . Either way do you really have to write crap about Mind of Mencia . It's GOOD SHOW . Maybe you're just venting your anger because that girl dumped you on World of Warcraft . Or you're constipated . Try putting fiber in your diet .
8954_7.txt,1, Watched this flick on Saturday afternoon cable . Man did it drag . got the metaphors symbolism and all that stuff . No did n't care one way or another about the sexuality of the characters . But the pacing of the story and the scripting almost put me to sleep . That is . until Ruth Marshall got naked . If you're a breast who is not homo you may want to rent it . Ruth has a lesbian sex scene that's pretty hot and then a hetero sex scene that is a notch higher than most standard movie fare . Her jiggly made the film worth the watch . Mighty Avatar
11192_7.txt,1, so wo n't disagree with the critics but really was not all that moved by this movie . was a little hesitant to rent it am going through some of the same things the protagonist is supposed to be experiencing . yet did rent it thinking that might experience some catharsis or at the least understand that am not alone . while understood the protagonist's irritation with his careless cousin did n't feel his internal struggle with isolation as much as would have liked . felt that much more emphasis was placed on his disruptive cousin overstaying his welcome . it is a beautifully filmed movie and did really appreciate the use of silence to bring out the feeling of isolation .
3920_9.txt,1, probably the best horror movie in years . there's been lame remakes attempts to make you scared all they make you do is walk out of the theater and movies that just should n't have been made . but this one is worth it . the only reason did n't give it a is because Paris Hilton is in it her death scene makes up for it believe me here they are . the SPOILERS of all the death scenes in the movie . my favorite death scene ever Paris Hilton's ! after finding her boyfriend Blake laying on the ground with a knife sticking out of his neck Paige starts to run . well speed walk is more respectable . she finds this like garage with all these cars in it . then of the killers cuts her ankle from below whole time shes holding a HUGE metal spike she drops it and runs and hides behind this car . the killer picks it up and as she looks through the window he throws it through the window and it shoots through her forehead . I've NEVER BEEN SO EXCITED OR LAUGHED SO HARD IN MY LIFE . Paige's boyfriend Blake gets a knife stabbed into his neck and then the killer walks up to him hes on the ground and steps on it pushing it farther into his throat . then he dies . Elisha cuthbert of the hottest chicks EVER does n't die PHEW but she does get her lips super together punched in the face and gets part of her index finger chopped off felt like heaving Carly's twin brother nick also survives but not without getting his ass kicked and a stab wound to the leg . nicks best friend Dalton gets thrown down a flight of stairs and then is decapitated . his body is dragged away and we see his eyes blink . then he gets covered in wax . wade boyfriend gets his Achilles tendon snipped by a massive pair of scissors and then is attacked by the same scissors . he does n't die but hes covered in wax and on occasions his skin is accidentally removed revealing his nasty bloody flesh . YUMMY . there it is . Definitely WORTH YOUR MONEY .
3485_7.txt,1, Due to its predictable second title one it was distributed under in Italy at least did n't expect much from this movie . Thought it'd be another cheap flick about a haunted house CASA MALEDETTA'' means The cursed house'' Well had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene ! The constant presence of priests and the creepy atmospheres reminded me a bit of The Exorcist and some of its decent Italian rip but this was going to be something completely different . This is more like Hitchcock meets Italian thriller ! Very well written and directed good actors interesting plot . OK I've tried not to spoil the viewing of Hyden Park'' for you which I'd highly recommend to everyone . Am wrong or when Joanna crawls or tries hard to stand paralyzed from the waist down her feet and legs move a little too much ? And I'm not talking of the bad dream'' sequence .
819_7.txt,1, Crack House was one of the few film during the that falls into this genre . What's supposed to be an anti film turns out to be nothing more than some white exercise in depravity . There's nothing wrong with that however . The video presentation even has an anti message from one of the stars of the show Richard turncoat'' Roundtree The movie follows two young lovers in high school . One of them is a quasi tough guy and the other is his girl . One of them get's turned out by a mutual friend whilst the other is given a trip to the slam and is later on given a chance to get back at his ex Jim Brown appears as the movie's Mister Big'' he's one bad dude who still can punk anybody and is a very sadistic guy who likes to smack his hoes and beat the tar out of those who try to defy his word . Luke from General Hospital makes a guest star spot as well . If you like hard edge sleaze then this movie's for you . Sadly Hollywood does n't make these any more and when they do it's neither exploitative nor entertaining . Recommended for sleaze fans .
4772_9.txt,1, SPOILERS As you may know have been commenting on a lot of silent short films in the past months . Now have no idea why am commenting on Steamboat Willie guess was just desperate to comment on anything so watched this and now am commenting on it . This or course is one of the very first cartoons and believe it is not the first cartoon with sound . Here is the plot . Mickey Mouse is driving a steamboat when Pete throws him off and he drives it . When they stop for cargo Minnie Mouse tried to get on but failed miserably . Mickey gets her up by a crane . Then a goat eats her sheet of paper with Turkey in the Straw on it . They use the goat to make the song . When say that mean that they used the goat as a Victrola . Mickey plays the animals on the steamboat for instruments to the song . Then an angry Pete throws Mickey in a potato room and Mickey is forced to peel potatoes for the rest of the day . Overall this is yet another groundbreaking silent short film . mean this is the third Mickey Mouse cartoon . Yes the third . Also this is not the first cartoon with sound . believe there were two more before this one . Either way this film is really really groundbreaking . Mikcey was also more violent than he is mow . mean he throws a potato at a bird and may have brutally slaughtered it . Recommended Films Plane Crazy .
10874_7.txt,1, do n't know if I'd go as far as to say that this movie belongs to the trash pile but it's fair to say that there are no Academy Award nominees here . What must be considered is that most of the actors in this film were n't actually actors as such just kids with nothing better to do at the time . There were many others that were offered roles in the film but turned them down to go surfing up the coast all things taken into account it really was n't a bad movie for its time . In some respects it's really not unlike today's times where peer pressure is still alive and kicking just without the mobile phones computers and other similar gadgets that kids lived without unlike this generation . Anyway have to rate this flick as an old fave that watch once in a blue moon and never take too seriously .
1373_10.txt,1, People seem to be expecting Citizen Kane here ! The Planet is a movie and as such is good fun and different enough to be enjoyed . The director clearly has something to offer not so sure about some of the cast . As for the effects ? ai n't a lot of effects budget . for one would happily recommend this outing to a sci head or anyone who does n't take monster movies too seriously . If so ? Watch blue instead . noticed one review saying it had ripped off Alien . Like Alien did n't rip things off . The best thing about the film ? The director . The worst thing about the film ? The cast . Maybe it's time for the Director to move from Glasgow to London and find some talent . In the meantime well done . At least you're trying to do something .
7917_8.txt,1, Alexander Nevsky'' marked director Sergei Eisenstein's return to film after a period of exile and what he produced is a bald propaganda film proclaiming Russia's superiority over Germany . There's very little plot Russians unite to battle Germans Russia wins . The film is really an extended montage of mostly battle scenes mixed in with some moments of German brutality a rather shocking scene that shows German soldiers throwing Russian children onto a raging fire This was Eisenstein's first sound film and it's clear that he had no idea what to do with the medium . Indeed this film really looks more like a silent film with some sound added . There are some dialogue scenes but they sit rather lifelessly on the screen and the pacing is all off as if the actors were n't actually on the set together at the same time when they were filming them . Eisenstein mostly uses sound as an excuse to overlay a rousing Prokofiev score over the proceedings and indeed that's one of the film's biggest assets . Say what you will about Eisenstein's ability lack of to direct actors or tell his film in a more narrative format he certainly knows how to edit images and music together for maximum effect and Alexander Nevsky'' over all shines through its deficiencies . Grade
12216_10.txt,1, Surface is one of the best shows that have ever seen . NBC is so stupid for canceling a great show like this and worse of all only leaving it half complete . NBC or someone else should give Surface at least one more season just so it can be completed . It's as if NBC gave you a book to read and half way through it they decide to take it away from you and then you can never find out the ending . just want to see what happens to everyone and most importantly see what happens to Nim . think can say this safely about most Surface fans is that we want to save Nim ! Nim has taken all of our hearts away and then NBC just cuts them in two . Come on NBC just give Surface one more season !
4953_7.txt,1, In the patriotism and in some cases flat out Jingoism was pretty high . Do we get to win this time'' a line famous from Rambo First Blood part II could almost sum up how many people felt at that time . longing for the style of films they grew up with flat out balls to the wall we're good your bad . let's blow something up and go home'' While Rambo Rocky and for the most part Top Gun seemed more geared towards attracting an older crowd Iron Eagle went straight for the kids . Canadian writer and director Sidney Furie brings out everything that you love and hate about that time period . The kick in the pants rock out anthems say die Road of the Gypsy etc to the over the top and sometimes almost unbelievable action adventure . Iron Eagle succeeded for one reason . was Fun . It's the type of movie you can turn on and sit back and enjoy every ridiculous totally moment . You do n't have to think about if it could really happen or if the acting is truly believable it's just fun . that's all you can really ask for in this type of movie .
5633_8.txt,1, enjoyed this one because can relate to it . At one time in my life was trying to make films and experienced many of the same problems Mark Borchardt did in trying to make HIS film . And also went through a protracted period of self arrested development where refused to grow . But then miraculously got married and had kids . realized that being a struggling filmmaker was in all likelihood not going to feed my family . So got a decent job and did what felt needed to do to make that happen . That is what an mature responsible adult does . Mark has n't faced up to that reality as yet and so in that sense he is a retarded adolescent . For this reason there is a hopelessness about him . Like Don Quixote he seems so inept and self that he does n't realize how bad off he really is . The viewer feels a sense of superiority and pity for him and his circle . Mark has kids and an ex and bills to pay but the film depicts him caring basically only about pursuing his artistic vision'' Despite this Mark comes across in the film as a likeable individual surrounded by a very interesting family and group of friends . Unfortunately Mark lacks many of the things necessary to be successful both in life and in a career maturity responsibility education knowledge life experience prioritization financial clout etc . Yet he trudges on much like Ed Wood apparently without any semblance of a clue . guess we are supposed to feel encouraged by the spectacle of the never say die'' attitude of this noble individual struggling against the odds . And man what odds there are ! Kiefer Sutherland Colin Hanks Tori Spelling and Angelina Jolie are all offspring of big film or TV people no doubt they will all want to direct some day if they are n't already . How much room is there for an independent like Mark ? It's like watching a guy hit himself in the head with a board over and over again . Come to think of it that is pretty close to what happens to one of Mark's actors with the kitchen cabinet door in one of the funniest scenes have ever seen in any movie . Despite these misgivings and seeming criticisms truly enjoyed this movie and would heartily recommend it to anyone . Uncle Bill is amazing . have a friend who met both Mike and Mark and he told me that in real life these guys are just exactly the way they appeared in the movie .
9037_7.txt,1, Take a look at those faces alongside the entrance to the jail . They're not the faces of Hollywood extras . Somebody in production was really smart to take filming to Oxford Mississippi because you ca n't get that kind of authenticity from a studio backlot . Scope out the narrow dusty roads the frozen earth beneath and the skeletal trees just barely hanging on . No wonder those faces look hard and unforgiving they're just reflecting the soil from which they spring . Old man Lucas better fear for his life but then he springs from that same hard earth . The movie works because it tells a good story that neither preaches nor sentimentalizes and even has some suspense . Old man Lucas is not very likable . He's a victim and we sympathize but he's also haughty and unfriendly . Wisely the script refuses to sweeten him up . That way we're forced to recognize the effects of racism and injustice on even the less sympathetic . The script also wisely avoids dealing directly with racism since that tends to become preachy and less effective . Instead we're shown how easily prejudice can convict an innocent man and condemn him to a horrible death . So it's through our common instinct to see justice done that the effects of racism are exposed a much more effective pathway . It also makes the actions of the sheriff and the lawyer more understandable since they are otherwise part of the Jim Crow system . Note how the movie does n't attack segregation . It's doubtful that old man Lucas would want to mix with whites anyway and there's no hint that even lawyer Stevens wants to cross the color line except to see justice done . No the possibility of reconciliation lies in the future as symbolized by the kid whose head is not yet filled with notions'' He's not exactly friends with Lucas but he has glimpsed the common humanity of being befriended after falling into the frozen creek . The last line of dialogue also shows him siding with his uncle the lawyer instead of his more hidebound parents dinner table scene is important and easily overlooked The lawyer might not join a future civil rights march but the kid might . That's the movie's realistically hopeful side . There was a bunch of racially themed movies during this brief year period Well No Way Out Home of the Brave Lost Boundaries Even famously detached MGM got into the mix with this little gem . Unfortunately the McCarthy purges in Hollywood put an end to problem'' films that might not serve Cold War ends . Even so each of these is worth catching up with not only because they're good movies but because even with the passage of years and Jim Crow they're still relevant .
2673_9.txt,1, When the movie first started thought cheesy . The first ten minutes were really boring . After the slow beginning and some of the soap opera antics started liking it . The plot was different than anything had ever seen . Now was it a horror ? Not really . It should n't have been classied as a horror or the producers should have put more money into the movie to make it scary . As it was the creatures where only there for a short time . can only assume this was for money reason . The good side was that the movie was very entertaining . It held my interest the start and did make me wonder about creatures from another dimension . It was obvious that this was a first time movie for the director but there were a couple of highlights . By the end was hooked . Too bad Hollywood did n't put more money behind this .
6268_8.txt,1, God bless Joe D'Amato . love Italian horror cheese sci etc . This one admittedly was a bit harder to watch but another fun BAD movie . like how people preface a negative review with normally enjoy bad movies but . No buts this was a bad movie FOR people who love bad movies . It's one of my top bad movies . Miles O'Keefe was a poor man's Conan but oh what fun . Who ca n't have fun with a primitive nuclear bomb a hangglider and a cheesy rubber monster ? It's fine to hate this movie if you only like Hollywood drek like Titanic'' or Pretty Woman'' but if you truly mean TRULY love bad movies check this one out . This is one of those movies that are fun to rent for a beerbust or when you have a couple buddies around and looking for a little mindless fun . My rating
10395_10.txt,1, was stunned by this film . Afterwards did n't even want to see any films for a long time any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison . For many it may be the worst of Antonioni very slow without an engaging conventional story line microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions and the worst of Wenders verbose confused transcendentalism . It is composed of short distinct episodes linked by Wenders typical meandering hero's stream of consciousness so it does n't produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema . But for fans the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching a single poetic image that stretches across the film . Wenders and Antonioni create a discourse between their segments that seeks out the heart of things .
229_10.txt,1, One night was listening to talk radio and they had Leslie Nielsen on the program . He went on to explain why there were only shows . With TV shows like MASH you could go to the fridge to get a beer and as long as you heard what was going on you did n't miss anything . But with Police Squad you HAD to watch the show with the sight gags you missed a whole lot if you did n't see them . Who could forget the part of town known as Little Italy'' with the coliseum in the background . Even the movies relied heavily on the sight gags but then again being in the theater you were a captive audience . Leslie also said the one reason the show movies and other movies like Airplane were funny is because they did n't attempt to tell what was funny . It was up to the viewer to get the jokes . Well that's just my cents .
4283_9.txt,1, How on earth can people give this movie a low rating . Unbelievable . The performances of Wilkinson and Watson are so full of merit that can only imagine that these detractors were weaned on blockbusters and porn . this sounds bad it's because just wiped my original just now was so impressed by Tom Wilkinson . All hail the guy . This is a performance of considerable subtlety and massive skill . His development as an actor from The Full Monty to this masterpiece of a performance is amazing one of the best things to happen in film in the last ten years . Emily Watson is somewhat less commanding due to that glint in her eye that says me ? this cheeky woman here ? You ca n't guess what I'm going to do next because do n't know either ! It seems to be something she ca n't help showing us in every role but still she's an actor of terrific ability and presence . She is very sexy here as she needs to be and fair play to her for this this is a screen quality that normally for me she does n't have in previous films . As you might expect Rupert Everett required to play an upper late something who could give tutorials at Phd level in How Not To Give a Toss About Heading to Hell On Account of Total Selfishness delivers . He is so thin here throughout the movie however I'm worried for him . Linda Bassett's housekeeper is also excellent a smallish role but with a major plot twist to deliver she makes you ponder how much talent we have in Britain in terms of character acting . want to see more of her . The narrative arc is fine it's an interesting enough plot given that no in film seems to be trying to convince Joe Public that there's nothing new under the sun though it does stray towards melodrama in the last But never mind that this is a terrific minutes worth of anyone who has half money . Congrats to Julian Fellowes on his first directorial effort how we need more films of substance like this . He shows a lot of skill in terms of adapting the original novel telling a story with much effectiveness and subtlety . And congrats too on conjuring an immense display of the film actor's art from Mr Tom Wilkinson . What a geezer .
1012_8.txt,1, Despite some really scenic locations in the orient and some sporadically energetic music by Franco Micalizzi this film does n't quite reach the level of Joe D'Amato similar efforts while staying just about as trashy . The author of the original book Emmanuelle The Joys of a Woman'' Emmanuelle Arsan directed and had a smallish role in this film which mostly pornographically showcases a very young Annie Belle as she gets in a variety of oddball sexual situations . Her boyfriend played by ZOMBIE's Al Cliver actually approves of her sleeping around and even persuades her to continue her practices even after the two of them are married ! Orso Maria Guerrini drops by as a professor who is oh so usually married simultaneously to two women one of whom is played by Arsan herself . Despite beginning promisingly and having a few hilarious lines of dialog like can you see me with the naked eye ? can see you better naked ! the film shambles along plotlessly up until the less finale . Much like D'Amato EMANUELLE AND THE LAST CANNIBALS the main characters are all in search of some lost tribe but do n't get your hopes up there's no violence at all in this film and not much sex either for that matter . Just a lot of nudity and silly dialog . could n't help but find some appreciation for this little film if only for the completely cornball logic the film goes by .
10424_7.txt,1, This was a very nice soft movie for both men and women . Plenty of nudity but without the overall raunch you'll usually find . They could not have done a better job in casting as the entire ensemble was stunning . Trust me guys if you want to get your woman in the mood get something with Bobby Johnston in it ! And I'm sure lovely Monique Parent Samantha McConnell and the rest of the ladies would do it for any heterosexual male . Unfortunately Bobby and Monique do not share a scene together and if you are aware of a movie where they do please PM me ! I'd love to know . The photography was much better than usual . So was the story . Predictable but nice sweet natured and romantic . At the very least it was not one of those annoying predictable murder mysteries full of bottle blonde women with huge fake breasts . give this
9753_8.txt,1, Hunt for Justice is about the setup of Slobadon Milosevic for his trial in the Hague . While it was a little too clinical in presentation the subject matter could have gotten very depressing very quickly . Canadian Judge Louise Arbour becomes the Chief War Crimes Prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal for the UN in Yugoslavia . She battles everyone to pull out the evidence that sent Milosevic to trial . Not a bad docu with class directing and production work . The was disturbing by the shear discussion of the facts happily they did n't go into too much detail and no real pictures of the tortured .
7646_8.txt,1, like Armand Assante my cable company's summary sounded interesting so watched it twice already and probably will again . The early part is difficult to follow but later it clears up . believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends . Some of the acting is unconvincing but maybe that's because was always expecting some kind of double In that case the poor acting would be the insincerity of the characters interacting with each other so it fits very well . The important theme is the carnival owner is laundering money for a local casino his snake wife Dominczyk wants to steal it . She complains to Archie'' how terrible her life is and how he could help her get out of it . There are or plot twists is probably the reason for all of those loose ends and just when you think you have solved the mystery something else will happen . My score is mostly for the plot . wo n't say any more do n't like spoilers so do n't want to be one but believe this film is worth your time .
10913_7.txt,1, The funniest performance was by Shalom Harlow as Matt Dillon's supermodel girlfriend . She was more interesting to me than all the lead actors . This movie got it all wrong even the most dependable actress of the century Joan Cusask was not able to rise about the ridiculousness of the plot . did enjoy hearing Macho Man'' by the Village People over the closing credits . The rest of the movie might have been tolerable if it were to rise to that level of energy .
426_9.txt,1, David Morse and Andre Braugher are very talented actors which is why I'm trying so hard to support this program . Unfortunately an irrational plot and very poor writing is making it difficult for me . I'm hoping that the show gets a serious overhaul or that the actors find new projects that are worthy of them .
983_7.txt,1, Okay I'll admit that if did n't have kids never would have seen this film and would never see it . But considering all the rotten kids movies have seen as SPY KIDS or BABE PIG IN THE CITY this is a significant improvement . And it had enough in it that was n't totally bored out of my skull or contemplated suicide did repeatedly in the other two movies Sure the performances are pretty broad and the plot is kinda silly it IS a kids film . And compared with other films in the genre this is definitely better than average . Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bines actually appear to have some talent and probably will continue to have careers after puberty least on infomercials or doing voice So if you are looking for a film to see with your kids you certainly could do a lot worse !
7931_9.txt,1, Watching some of the sequences the entire of the film devoted to the battle on the ice in Alexander Nevsy a film directed by the Russian legend Sergei Eisenstein by Dmitri Vasilyev in his only significant credit made me realize how much must really go into directing at least on a scale such as this . If were a member of an awards group at the time of this film's release probably would award Eisenstein with the director's award of the year posthumously . It is such a mad stroke of cinematic genius to pull off some of things that are pulled off in the film though for someone like this director after coming off of his best work Battleship Potemkin and October it could have been something he scoffed at at first . But amid a film that is sometimes a little frustrating with how little grays come in to the black and white subject matter it's still a marvel of celluloid almost years later . Lord of the Rings fans meet the films grandfather so to speak . To say that something is a propaganda piece already puts a connotation to it and often a bad one . It is something that has a full message to it and a point of view . It's still a matter of hot debate the swarms of argument over Moore's films for proof about whether great art can come out of something that is point meant to rouse the audience in a specific manner . In this particular case the Russians against the Germans . At the time it was nearing WW and Russia once again faced the invaders and it's interesting to note that Eisenstein was actually commissioned to make this film as a rallying call for the Russians to never forget a crucial piece of their history . The end result comes out as being something that is actually slightly common from seeing Battleship and October however if nothing else comes through those films it's that Eisenstein is most concerned about how the image and the content can come together finitely for the viewer that style can completely envelop the viewer without fail . On those terms Alexander Nevsky is fearless . But even with the whole idea of great Germans bad there are some small moments where things are made a little less stringent a little less strict to these ideals . For example when we first see the Germans in Privka they're not some faceless blob who are totally barbaric and have a blind conquering intent that they are n't out to take whatever they can They have their own national pride going too that it would be nothing less for them to go forward with whatever their Christian masters tell them to . At the least the evil of the picture has a face however kept at a low minimum for the more prevalent side to kick in . There's also a brief scene before the ice battle where the Russian troupe has a joke that's being told and laughed about and it adds a little extra depth where else there might be precious little . Because more often than not in Alexander Nevsky with its battle songs loaded with a pride in warfare there are n't any complexities to characters most notably Nevsky himself in ultra fashion only questioning near the start by Nikolai Cherkasov who perhaps has to be this way in Eistenstein's intention of having him as the one infallible force to be reckoned with in the tale . After all to be looking for naturalism in an Eisenstein film is like trying to find non pig's feet at a deli . But the real reason to see the picture is n't the acting anyhow but for the look of the film how it moves and takes in such an expansive environment that Eisenstein lays out . On the epic scale it's just as ambitious as his films with a number of extras not just in the main battle scenes but also in the scenes in the cities of the hundreds of people rolling on through . In fact I'd say that any director working in Hollywood or elsewhere thinking of doing some kind of huge epic particularly war would do very well to take a look at this film even with just the sound off . It's even better if thought of as a silent film with the visual strokes accentuated fantastically at times . One could spend a whole month analyzing the battle on the ice how it starts with the German soldiers far away and then coming forward like bugs and then how Eisenstein inter between close of the actors fighting and then to wide and with sped editing . And of course one ca n't discount the power of the music as well Sergei Prokofiev delivering one of the great rousing scores of any epic work . All the while the director's editing keeps our eyes moving along with this frantic action at breakneck speed . If this was just a short film it would surely rank with the greats much like the Odessa Stairs sequence . If did find it a little less than totally magnificent it would be because of the faults that do come in from a director who is much more suited to the silent medium than for sound . While have yet to see Ivan the Terrible my one negative criticism would be of his direction of actors which is really as broad as can be with the melodrama at such a high its staggering sub of the two soldiers vying for the Olga is the best example can think of But even this considered Alexander Nevsky overall is too extraordinary to ignore and ratchets up an engagement in the action and the film to a level that puts a benchmark for films even today to try and live up to . Grade
10504_7.txt,1, Spoilers ! woman gets pregnant but not by her husband . She develops inside her or at least thats what her husband thinks . They go through a lot of hard times while she is on the brink of a nervous breakdown . The husband contacts an UFO professor and with his help they try to find out what is wrong with her . Spoilers ! The story could have been a bit better or at least be made less predictable but the movie is catchy and it got me and my sister hooked through the entire movie without a problem . The acting is very good and the filming is much better than normal if you compare this to your normal movie . The effects are good and something is happening every second of the movie . The characters are really likable and apart from a stupid nurse in on scene they are all very convincing in their roles . thought it was a good movie and can recommend it if you like alien movies ! The story could have been a bit less predictable .
7301_7.txt,1, Jane Smiley novel loosely based on Shakespeare's KING LEAR about the Cook family and its dark secrets . Director Moorhouse seems tamed in her approach allowing the characters to step forward and take a bow . And how could you go wrong with the talents of Pfeiffer Lange Leigh Firth Carradine and Robards ?
10501_10.txt,1, I've taken another look at this film and still consider it pretty good . Chloe is one of the few hardcore stars who really can act . She appears occasionally in soft core such as Body of Love'' and Lady Chatterly's Stories'' on Showtime . thought Nicole Hilbig did OK too with her nice body and charming accent . Too bad she's not in more films .
4220_8.txt,1, It's unbelievable but the fourth is better than the second and the third . After the third that was awful it's incredible how they could have an unexpected sequel with new ideas . Chuck is the same nasty doll of the previous movies . Interesting the final that lets know that a fifth can be done .
4735_9.txt,1, When began watching thought was watching some pro amateur documentary . However had never seen of the footage they used . They interviewed people saying that the FBI instigated all these things which sounded so far fetched but then followed in up with FBI video and testimony . was amazed . The documentary followed up with the senate investigation after the fire and after seeing the interview and video footage you will be shocked at how the Senate and Attorney General turn their backs on Davidians basically to cover up the aggression by the FBI If you start watching this you must finish it . Otherwise you will think it is propaganda of something like that .
1021_7.txt,1, An enjoyable movie without a doubt and very evocative of both its era and that very particular stage in any boy's of passage But have to say that having read the very positive comments here was a bit disappointed . The period was captured but the plot was desperately thin . The whole thing revolves around the most egregious bit of miscasting in the history of school plays . The idea that quack quack would ever be chosen to play not only one of only three star turns but a philanderer is risible . And without that nada . The sub bore no relation that could see to the main plot all of them could be removed in their entirety without in any way affecting the main story which surely suggests a fundamental flaw . When all your sub look like padding you know a central idea is being stretched beyond its limits . Nevertheless it's a benign movie with its heart in the right place there are some fine performances and you just get the feeling that everyone involved felt deflated at the final That good feeling permeates the film . And that has to count for something . flawed really quite good movie . out of
1683_9.txt,1, was amazed at the quality of this film particularly after seeing pictures of the barely adult director all lbs of him ! Truly a boy directing a movie about a boy . look forward to seeing more Luke Eberl films . did think this one was a bit too long . There was too much time spent showing Connor being unsuccessful unwilling to make a move on Owen . Caleb did n't try hard enough . Owen being so young could have easily become closer to Caleb and later decided it was n't his preference . And Owen would still have learned the valuable lesson'' about corruption and politics . Instead he did n't give himself a fair chance to learn about his sexuality . And what about poor Caleb ? Owen could have been a good influence . Though the film intends to show Owen as a hero who overcomes perverted corruption felt sad for Owen . He was offered the opportunity to have some boy fun with Caleb who was extraordinarily beautiful . Owen did n't have to go along with the political perversion as offered . But he could have tried to have some fun with Caleb and still walked away when he wanted . It was clear that Owen was in charge no one forced him to do anything he did n't want to do . But he could have had more fun and with a very hot boyfriend at that . hope Luke makes more movies where appealing young characters have more fun .
11779_10.txt,1, caught this little gem totally by accident back in or was at a revival theatre to see two old silly sci movies . The theatre was packed full and no warning they showed a bunch of sci short spoofs get us in the mood Most were somewhat amusing but THIS came on and within seconds the audience was in hysterics ! The biggest laugh came when they showed Princess Laia'' having huge cinnamon buns instead of hair on her head . She looks at the camera gives a grim smile and nods . That made it even funnier ! You got ta see Chewabacca'' played by what looks like a Muppet ! It was extremely silly and stupid . could n't stop laughing . Most of the dialogue was drowned out because of all the laughter . Also if you know Star Wars'' pretty well it's even funnier deliberately poke fun at some of the dialogue . This REALLY works with an audience ! definite
12386_10.txt,1, Okay I'll say it . This movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt . This statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film . But the thing that most people do n't get is that this movie was intended to be bad and cheezy . mean did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece ? Just look at the scary'' hologram on the jacket of the movie and you'll find your answer . Instead like the original Jack Frost thought was just as funny this movie turned out to be a side journey into the depths of corny dialogue bad one liners and horrible special effects . And it's all made to deliver laughter to us viewers . It certainly worked for me . For example Anne Tiler her troubled husband What makes you frown so heavily darling ? If that chunk of dialogue does n't make you laugh then you have serious issues . Who in their right mind would utter those words in real life ? Of course no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous ! Just take one viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations and hopefully you'll see what's so damn funny about Jack Frost
8189_7.txt,1, Chen Kaige lost his sense of tempo . envy Europeans and Americans who can watch the film without following the dialog with their ears because it is painful to do slow unnaturally heavy and over But Westerners on the other hand suffer from the poor quality of subtitle translation which manages to lose all the subtlety and double meanings that make a careful study of the film so much fun .
9020_10.txt,1, saw this film a week ago and had to persuade my friend to come with me because this film seems to be getting such bad reviews . Sure it is no Traffic or Stock . but is by no means a flop . think the fact that there are so many big budget films out at the moment means it has been ignored but it should n't be . reckon it sets out to do what it wants to do entertain us for an hour and a half and leave us feeling happy and contented . would much rather go and see it that Mummy which looks boring . And no I'm not a teenager . Do n't listen to the critics Star Wars fans did n't . This film is well worth seeing if just to see the gorgeous Luke de Lacey and Rupert Penry Go see it !
506_8.txt,1, Blade is a dark gloomy but significent vampire movie and is one of the best ones . bit of gore but nothing really that bad . Wesley snipes played a strong role as he eliminates the vampires . Not really like buffy because thats too tame but Blade delivers a decent plot and it's the kind of movie that you would probably like to watch on a dark stormy night . at best viewing !
9937_7.txt,1, Opera title is terror at the opera is somewhat of a letdown after some of Dario's other movies like Phenomena Tenebre and Suspiria . still ca n't find Inferno anywhere . it's one of those movies that has a great first half but midway through it's like someone started slowly letting the air out of the screenplay and logic . the basic plot involves a beautiful opera singer who is being stalked by a deranged obsessed fan . this killer begins killing people close to her in a most unique fashion . he binds and gags her and tape tiny sharp pins under her eyelids so if she tries to close her eyes she'll gouge out her eyes . this forces her to watch while the killer murders her acquaintances in typically brutal and gory Argento fashion . unfortunately about midway through the film becomes sluggish and illogical . is especially directed towards the killer's motivations . still have n't completely figured out why he's such a nut . the ending especially come out of left field in the worst possible sense . but for about the first hour or so this is some of Dario's best filmmaking and the camera work is breathtaking . too bad it could n't maintain it through to the end . rating
8972_7.txt,1, It's possible to have a good time with this film while at the same time regretting all that it is n't . In the a raffish congressman Hanks engineers support for Afghan partisans resisting the Soviet Union . Hanks is in breezy hail form as roguish politically incorrect Charlie Wilson first glimpsed sharing a hot tub with three deeply available looking women . If only the film had the same air of insouciance but apart from Philip Seymour Hoffman's turn as a cynical CIA agent it tries to be perceived as patriotic too . Aaron Sorkin's trademark staccato dialogue serves its purpose but the story is no more plausible than one of Wilson's tall tales . And there's an oddly unspoken subtext Wilson's Afghan pals later mutated into the Taliban and other anti groups leaving the world worse off than it was when these events occurred .
11565_7.txt,1, This is a cute little French silent comedy about a man who bets another that he ca n't stay in this castle for one hour due to its being haunted . And once the guy enters the house it looks much more like a crazed fun house or maybe like the after of LSD ! While there ARE ghosts and skeletons there is a weird menagerie of animals odd special effects and gags as well . It's awfully hard to describe but the visuals alone make the film worth seeing . HOWEVER understand that the self director also had many funny gags'' that totally fell flat and hurt the movie . His camera tricks'' were n't so much tricky but annoying and stupid . IGNORE THESE AND KEEP WATCHING does get better . The film is fast paced funny and worth seeing . In particular really liked watching the acting and mugging of Max Linder was so expressive and funny ! Too bad he is virtually forgotten today . For an interesting but very sad read check out the IMDb biography on him .
161_7.txt,1, know little or nothing about astronomy but nevertheless was at first a little sceptical about the plot of this movie . It follows three children that were all born during a solar eclipse and so have no emotion and thus become ruthless serial killers . The plot does sound ridiculous at first but once you realise that a solar eclipse blocks out Saturn and as you know Saturn is the emotion planet it all falls into place makes complete sense and it's then that you know you are n't simply watching another silly slasher with a pea brain plot . Thank god for that ! Seriously though Bloody Birthday is based on a ridiculous premise but it more than makes up for that with it's originality . Having a bunch of kids going round slaughtering people may not be the most ingenious masterstroke ever seen in cinema but when given the choice between this and another dull Friday the clone know what I'd choose . Also helping the film out of the hole that some people would think it's silly plot dug it into is the fact that it's extremely entertaining . Many slashers become formulaic far too quickly and the audience ends up watching simply to see some gore . This film however keeps itself going with some great creepy performances from the kids harks back to creepy kid classics such as Village of the Damned a constant stream of sick humour and a small but impressive for the type of film dose of suspense and tension . One thing that liked a lot about this movie was the vast array of weaponry . There's nothing worse than a slasher where the killer uses the same weapon over and over again Halloween cough but that's not the case here as Bloody Birthday finds room for everything from skipping ropes to bow and arrows . There was n't any room for a chainsaw which is a huge shame but suppose not every film can have a chainsaw in it .
967_7.txt,1, Big fat liar is a pretty funny movie . But as was watching it thought about something . Some of the events that occur in this film are unbelievable . So really the film is kind of a big fat lie . There is no way that he could've gotten away with all of this . Here are all of the unbelievable stuff . When he fakes his father had choked on a meatball and acts like he is the father . Jason Munez could n't have gotten away with that . Well luckily for us he did n't . So it did n't stick with it the outrageous . if the Grandmother was blind she still could've figured out that that was n't her granddaughter . could n't have gotten on the plane flown to acted like they were coat salesmen sneak into the studio and then and then . Well some of the film is a little unbelievable . But it does n't hurt to tell a little white lie . Trust me do it all the time . Big fat liar though unbelievable at times is fun . It's also very funny . But let me just say one thing before continue this review . If Paul Giamatti was n't in this movie it would really suck . It would be horrible . Big fat liar is also pretty funny though corny at times . give it a thumbs up . Big fat liar

Challenge which aired Sunday mornings was decent too but all the big stuff happened on this show . Wrestlers would do all their interviews with Mean Gene on a platform next to the live crowd or talk on their own to the screen in front of a background that promoted them . The matches were usually squashes but sometimes you would see mid carders square off in the main event . There were also interview shows that usually resulted in violence thus setting up a feud . These segments ranged from Pipers Pit The Body Shop The Flower Shop The Snake Pit The Brother Love Show The Funeral Parlor and The Barber Shop . do n't recall any titles changing hands on this show . That usually happened at pay per views and Saturday Nights Main Event .

What or year old actually gets all that anyways its all about the colors and the singing . For those of you saying that all they do on Barney is eat junk food and recommend Sesame Street better well what about cookie monster'' thats all he eats but have n't seen anyone comment that one . do agree that sesame is a better educational show but barney is just like a show for fun do n't be too serious if you did n't like your child watching TV and worried about them understanding things you do n't believe then you should n't be propping them down in front of the TV in the first place because all of that is fake everything is fake actors are fake so why do n't you take your fake brains and put it to use and think if you have a problem with a fake television show for kids then turn it off and play with them yourselves and teach them what you want them to learn not BIG BIRD or Bert Ernie or barney someone who used to watch all those shows and turned out fine .
3874_7.txt,1, Back in the Day'' is an interesting but flawed effort . Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper a honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father . He meets his old friend Rhames who tries to force Reggie into a life of crime . Reggie also falls in love with Alica Ali who is the preacher's daughter . Now he has to choose Love Or Crime . Ja Rule does a competent job as Reggie . At least he's trying to act . Ving Rhames is perfect as He brings a lot of energy and menace into the role . Joe Morton as the preacher is his usual excellent self but he does n't do much . The same problem for Giancarlo Esposito as Reggie's Dad . He needed more screen time . do n't want to say this but Pam Grier is pretty awful as Mrs. Cooper . She overacts every scene and brings the movie down . Tia Carrere and Frank Langella are in it but do n't do anything substantial for the plot . In the end You should see it for the skilled performances of Ving Rhames and Joe Morton and the grittiness of the writing and directing .

While the film is sure to draw attention mainly to it's bizarre plot line and a few interesting visual treats it's going to come off better as a dark comedy than a horror film . It's definitely a film you should see if your into the kind of stuff but if your looking for a scare or even a small chill you'll want to look elsewhere .

He then paints himself black with a white stripe down his back and adds a bit of Limburger cheese to make him stink . At first life could n't be better for him the dog flees and the butcher abandons his shop letting the cat walk off with a pile of meat . Just as he is thinking everything is perfect he is noticed by a real skunk not just any skunk but the overly amorous Pep Le Pew . Pep mistakes the poor cat for a female skunk and pursues him thinking his protestations are just shyness . Our poor cat thinks he has escaped when he throws a skunk skin from a tall building so that Pep will think he is dead at first it seems to work but as he sneaks off Pep sees him and instantly forgets the dead skunk . In the end the cat realises he was better off being kicked and attacked than being lusted after by a randy skunk . there is a nice ending for the skunk too when his wife finds out what he has been up to . This was a fairly funny introduction to Pep Le Pew who back then was just overly amorous but now looks like a randy sexually harassing stalker although he was punished for his behaviour in the end .
1909_9.txt,1, Dolemite is awesome . Rudy Ray Moore's rhymin kung fu pimp with horrible choreographed action sequences is about as close as you can get to becoming a spoof of a genre without actually being spoof . Citizen Kane this may not be nor Les Infant Au Revoir but this is undoubtedly genius in it's own right . The production values in this movie are so bad they could qualify as existential special effects . The plot drags a little in the middle but the power of such a cheap premise as kung fu hookers is enough to bring all but the snootiest film lovers through . The infamous ever present boom mike evokes shades of the gloriously incompetent Ed Wood and never grows unfunny . sometimes wonder if the boom mike was left in on purpose as commentary on the ridiculous aspects of movies in general but usually get distracted by erotic scenes that lack eroticism to the point of high art mundanacity . Everything is this movie is alive and breathing dripping with desperate longing to be simultaneously loved and reviled . It works . out of
12477_7.txt,1, Should we take the opening shot as a strange frame ? guess we have to . Anyway two women are behind a closing umbrella they walk upstairs to the talent agency and we go with them . then they are never to be seen again . Okay how come not INSIDE the place at the piano or even outside with the SOUND of the piano then track inside and over a la Hitchcock ? So guess Clouzot is already telling us in a not very subliminal manner that we are following a segment of postwar society especially how he then uses a Citizen Kane song cut up into about five pieces to show the lady singing traveling from the talent agency all the way to her first roses and applause of her Vaudeville debut . After that we are relentless observers of more or less small disgusting details of a defeated country getting off its war torn tattered knees . And nobody ever handled small disgust better than Clouzot . In fact too bad he never tried Sartre's Nausea . Almost everything we see after the first few minutes makes us ever so slightly queasy . okay I'm grossly overstating that let's just settle for a general feel of a lot of the film . Look carefully in fact and you will even see one of the cops picking his nose . And in how many films has anyone ever done that . Then there is a very loud nose blowing bit in front of the photographer lesbian by the main cop and notice that she does not literally blink an eye or raise an eyebrow . The point of all this is an almost feverish immersion in contiguity seemingly until you can smell practically every scene as well as see and feel it . As for the other aspects of the movie others here have covered them in a lot more detail than But forget about the mystery here this is the ultimate McGuffin . Clouzot is about as interested in the real killer as those two women coming in out of the rain in the first few seconds of the film and are never seen again . From beginning to end all he wanted to do was follow a bunch of people around not even particularly interesting ones at that and say here look at this woman's twitch that man's hitching of his pants in all their insignificance years and years before Tina Turner was singing we do n't need another hero . Even the forced levity of the ending is bleakly done in a dilapidated part of Paris and rather chilly bare walled apartment . With only the couples love for each other to see them through as if to say there must be two or three million like you throughout the city working your fingers off by the day for a little love at night . From this it was just a short step to Wages of Fear and the ultimate in despair . They do n't even know how to make films like this anymore in the For that matter they did n't even know how to very much in France then much less now . The relentless detail of gesture makes even the neorealists of Italy look like bad psychologists . Which guess makes Clouzot a kind of Rosselini on speed . Very enjoyable nonsense this movie . The only flaw seems to me and as was pointed out by another viewer the lead woman is somehow not quite right . Everybody else in the film is just about perfectly cast .

1622_9.txt,1, First got ta say that this film is way less pretentious than The Da Vinci Code . sure you have the religion vs science problem but it does n't try to make a big statement about it . its basically an action thriller that moves from one scene to another very well . one scene particularly involves fire found extremely well done . Second the changes from book to film . although when was following the development of the film complained about the change of some characters and the complete removal of others got ta admit was wrong . it was refreshing that the film did n't follow the book in exactly the same way like it was done in Da Vinci . if you are a purist of the book some of them may upset you though . However the BIG TWIST is still there so do n't worry about that . finally i'm glad they removed some silly sub and did n't even try to hint at the possibility of Langdon and Vittoria getting together . The performances are really good but nothing out of the ordinary . that's okay for a film like this . i'd give it a mainly because it delivers what it promises entertainment pure entertainment
10366_8.txt,1, Count me as being one who is happy to see no Hastings in this episode . The poor Dr. Watson does nothing for me as he simply drags down every scene he's in . Japp is often necessary to the story as the representative of officialdom and a little Miss Lemon is fine for seasoning but Hastings swings from painfully dim to over in different episodes . If have to sit through one more vacuous Oh say there ! I'll take the gas As a general rule the more Poirot you get in a Poirot story the better . Every line for Hastings is one taken away from Poirot . And I've never read the books so really do n't care about fidelity to Christie's characters . lot of viewers seem to have a problem with separating the movies from the books . If you want the book as written then read it . do n't see the point of watching the television version if you know what will come next at every stage . Theatre is not prose do n't expect a transcription .
7104_7.txt,1, The House of Dracula'' really has nothing new to offer in the way of chills or thrills or new twists on an already tired storyline . This film was made as a hasty sequel to the fairly better made House of Frankenstein'' from a year earlier . In House of Dracula'' you can see the factory like production values of taking their toll on an otherwise potentially scary movie . Stock footage from previous films in the series and then the ending from Ghost of Frankenstein'' used as the ending here just makes for an el cheepo'' flick . Therein lies the shame of the studio and the producer considering that they had top notch talent and merely wasted everybody's time and effort on a quick money return scheme . But that seems to have been the trend all throughout Hollywood at the end of WWII . This is what brought on some of those mindless SciFi pics of the with all their closeups of harmless lizards in order to make them appear as dinosaurs . The days of James Whale and Val Lewton to mention two were over as far as creating real mood and atmosphere in this genre . Keep in mind also that the makeup genius Jack Pierce who actually did medical research in order to create all of our favorites was summarily fired right after this particular film was released . lesser capable makeup man by the name of Bud Westmore was then hired as the head of this department at Universal soon to be Universal Not to denigrate Mr. Westmore's ability but horror films were just not his forte . OK to watch or not to watch . Watch this film but only as part of the chronological order of the Frankenstein series and you'll see how this all ended up as comic fodder for Abbott Costello .
12354_8.txt,1, Sheba Baby is always underrated most likely because it has a pg rating instead of the usual rating that a Grier movie gets . all that the pg means is that Pam does n't take her top off she takes her top off in every other movie she's been in though so . it is more exciting than Coffy more action . it takes off slow but by the time she's on screen the thrills have started . like Dolemite d'urville martin is the heavy trying to get Sheba's father but she ai n't having that . she wages a one woman war against martin and his gang of cronies . the best scene is with a stupid pimp in his car which i'm still laughing about . thought it would be stupid because of the pg rating but was wrong it replaces sex with violence and in a blaxplotation film that can only be good !
802_7.txt,1, The movie was very good . I'm an avid mystery fan and usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing . While did figure out who was going to be killed did n't figure out who did it . was n't happy with the portrayal of the Gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that Please know that while these Poirot movies are good they just do n't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they do n't have Japp Ms . Lemon and especially Hastings ! David Suchet is definitely Poirot . have seen every actor who's played him . The worst was Peter Ustinov !

3570_8.txt,1, This film is one to spend the short while entertainment but who then could be made in nobody country it does not have anything identifies the Colombian'' Who looks for the topics of the supposed Colombian or socially and politically correct cinema and what it is denominated it jeopardize'' is better than it is not going to see this film . Some to the drug traffic or the fight is no reference either farmer and worker or wing guerrilla and to the kidnapping political . The corrupt police is a personage who it could be Mexican Russian Italian or Chinese and also the personage protagonist an Argentine photographer it could be Venezuelan Peruvian or Philippine and the frequent boludo'' in its parliaments it could be replaced by another word of slang of any other country without the personage or history changes . The important thing is that it is a very decently counted history with images and right performances . Its quality almost is of TV movie but of the good ones .

8904_8.txt,1, but laughed . lot . saw et les Vikings at a public screening during the World Cup . The sound was lousy it was too bright to see the screen properly but still enjoyed myself immensely . The names of some of the characters had me rolling on the floor Smsix Abba Vikea . All not very witty but in good Ast tradition . Some very good jokes but also some that not everybody seemed to get . The only thing did n't like were the voices of Ast and Ob in the German version at least . The voice actors are very well around here which was the only reason they were casted really . They do n't fit the characters at all . All in all a good way to spend some time if it's free like in my case all the better and to have a couple of laughs . out of
6811_8.txt,1, The first in a new style of films for Lamas no tattoo's motorcycles or karate . for one miss them . But this is a serious movie . He plays a FBI profiler who has lived so long with the bad guys in his head that he no longer trusts anyone including himself . Gary Busey is either a great actor or somebody would n't want to meet in broad daylight on a crowded street . Kristen Cloke pursues Lamas as doggedly as she pursues the serial killer . There is one surprise after another as the story unfolds not the least of which is the ending . It seems to never come there is always one more layer to the story . Cloke and Lamas start out as the good guys turn into the bad guys and somehow end up the heroes . But it's definitely worth the rental price . For maximum enjoyment throw in a candy bar bag of popcorn and a soft drink . You're going to the MOVIES !
11972_7.txt,1, love dogs and the most interesting character in this movie is a Golden Retriever . He is smarter better looking and more interesting than any of the human characters . Like many other contributors have not read the book but doubt that having done so would change my opinion of the movie . It is predictable from the first five minutes on . No surprises . Mad scientists create a monster that gets loose and a teen age boy and his wonder dog collaborate to destroy it . All in all the movie is a dog . But as said love dogs and will therefore give this movie a rating . Watch it if it comes on TV rent it if you are bored and nothing else catches your eye but do n't buy it unless it is on special .
5539_7.txt,1, If you're looking for a not mob movie with a female as the lead you're in the right place . Pfieffer has acted much better than this . You can see she has matured beyond this picture . When first picked this movie up expected Pfeiffer was poorly miscast however she plays her mob wife role to the hilt . Not a bad performance from Baldwin either . If you do n't pay attention to the hair you might enjoy this movie . But do n't take it too seriously .
4673_8.txt,1, find it sad that just because Edward Norton did not want to be in the film or have anything to do with it people automatically think the movie sucks without even watching it or giving it a chance . really hope Norton did not do this . He is a fine actor and all but he scared people away from a decent movie . found it entertaining . It was n't mind blowing or anything with crazy special effects but it was not a bad . It was fun to watch . But yea definitely not a bad movie .
4036_10.txt,1, thought that the storyline came into place very well . liked this movie a lot . If you're going to rag on a Bridget Fonda movie you can just rot . thought that ragging on movie stars was a bad idea . Apparently somebody does n't think so . rather enjoyed the movie . I'm even thinking of buying it . want it to be my very first DVD for my room . That's how much like it . rather would not start an online argument with someone do n't know have it be over a movie . If someone could kindly retract what they said about the storyline would be more than happy to retract my insult . However if they feel that am not worthy of a retraction might just feel that they are not worthy of one either . But ca n't control their actions can only encourage them in the right direction . Hey they do n't have to make a retraction but would greatly appreciate it .
11807_8.txt,1, There was nothing else on tv yesterday afternoon so thought okay let's watch this . did n't know the plot and had no expectation whatsoever was thinking in a few minutes or so will channel surf again . But then story started to unfold and the characters played beautifully by the two boys . The story did have unrealistic parts and scenes but overall it was a real good movie . Very well worth watching .
6127_7.txt,1, very strange disturbing but intriguing film . do n't think ever needed to see what a human being can do with his butt and doubt if I'll ever want to see it again . That said there is much to be amused by like Divine's take on Jayne Mansfield's classic walk in The Girl Ca n't Help It'' and putting slabs of meat between her legs in a grocery store . gritty feel very much like a Russ Meyer film . Generally poor acting with the notable exception of Divine .
5680_7.txt,1, The basic plot of this film has already been detailed in several other comments so wo n't bother . I'd like to first commend the producer cast directors and crew for creating a wonderfully engaging film on a meager budget a small fraction of standard Hollywood fare that does n't LOOK cheap . These people have a drive to make something new and entertaining while not spending a fortune doing it . This is essentially art for art's sake . know know some of you will decide that this is not art but something less and that's fine . for one am glad that people like these will continue to put forth the time and effort for our benefit without expecting huge multimillion dollar payoffs . Now to the criticism . feel that the scenario presented is credible to a point . It's wonderful when everything works out and the hero saves the day and all's well that ends well . What gets me is the blatant manipulation of events so that blind luck is responsible more than courage and strength . When lee was attacked but not severely injured somehow she washed up on a mud bank right next to the dead guide . Then miraculously his loaded revolver is still in his holster and it actually works some cleaning and fiddling Finally when Lee is attacked on the mud bank and jumps in the water once again the croc fails to kill her . She ends up with her hand in his mouth and manages to repeatedly pull the trigger ultimately to blow the croc's brains out came to the conclusion that having Lee go hand to mouth with the croc was just a way to end the film with the human in triumph . Based upon what have seen the croc's attack and continue to hold on until the prey stops struggling . Croc's will spin around and around to dismember and drown the prey . That happened to the first victims but not to Lee . She had teeth marks but they were not deep . think that the ending would have been better had the croc won frankly thereby proving his dominance of the mangrove his territory for millions of years . But then how many of us would have been upset or disappointed that the pretty girl did n't get out alive ?
1557_10.txt,1, What Alice Found'' is the greatest movie that nobody's ever heard of ! underestimated it when heard of it and though that it would all sex no plot and just really stupid but in reality it was really good . They say all indie movies suck but this one and Napoleon Dynamite'' did n't suck . asked my friend who'd seen it before did and she said that Alice has all these three and you see all this nudity but no there is no three that remember and little nudity . The movie did have a point and it taught me never trust hitchhikers . liked that in the end they got Alice a little dolphin In the end on her way to Flordia . totally suggest seeing this movie .
12379_7.txt,1, do n't care what anyone says this movie is friggin hilarious . This is the sequel to Jack Frost a movie about a killer snowman . The snowman is created when a convicted serial killer about to be executed is taken to the execution chamber but the truck crashes with a truck carrying DNA manipulation chemicals that make human DNA bond with dirt or in this case snow . The first movie was just boring and eventually the snowman is destroyed by pouring antifreeze on him . Or so they thought . This movie takes place about a year after the second . Some scientists resurrect Jack Frost by mixing the antifreeze with chemicals . No explanation is ever given for why they do this they just do . Meanwhile the sherrif who arrested Frost in the first is going to the Bahamas . Unfortunately the snowman comes with him . This movie has it all . It has talking carrots that can stand up ice cubes that explode when you stick them in your mouth and killer snowballs . Yes killer snowballs . They even say Dada ! like babies . I'll have to give the makers of this credit . The snowballs are some of the cutest little things ever dreamed up . wish that could get one as a pet . Frost finally freezes the island as if a killer snowman has the ability to influence major weather patterns . Then there's the actors . There's Manners the FBI agent from the first movie except here he's wearing an eyepatch . YARR MATEYS SHIVER ME TIMBERS BE AN FBI AGENT ! YARRR ! And then there's the stereotypical British adventurer and the stereotypical black Jamaican with dreadlocks . And finally Captain Fun . The fruitiest man on the face of the planet bar none . This movie is n't scary but is is hilarious . laughed my butt off the whole way through and recommend this for anyone who likes a good bad'' movie . out
11300_8.txt,1, Heard about this film a long while ago and finally found it on ebay for five bucks . was n't expecting much but wow was ever surprised . It's a story of a boy and girl in love trying to escape an evil king who wants the girl for himself and takes place in a huge castle reminds me of ICO for PS because some shots gave you a sense of vertigo . pretty standard but this movie is insane ! It's hard to believe such an original animated feature was made in Also the king was probably one of the creepiest character's I've seen in a long time with a feminine walk weird eyes crossed and a soft but scary voice . The only problem had with the film was that the boy and girl had no personality and hardly even any lines except for calling for mr. wonderbird large talking green bird save them . The animation was fantastic in most areas but some cells were missing from some scenes which sucked . It's incredibly original with flying police and giant mechs and even laugh out loud funny at times it's a real shame this is such an obscure title because it's really a good film . Check it out sometime .
8106_10.txt,1, Before saw this film did n't really expect to much from it although my friend advised otherwise . Due to this request from my friend decided was really going to watch this film . The minute sat down to view the film was absolutely blown away . From the credits was falling of my seat just could n't contain myself . The film is about Hitler in all the glory of comedy . Hynkel is the absolute double for the Jewish Barber who comes back from fighting in the war . Due to the heroics of the barber he manages to save one of the germans and by doing that gets a member of the enemy on board which helps in the struggle which the jews had . But things went wrong and Stolz was arrested but only then to escape to the confines of the Jewish surburb Ghetto Due to this escape the german army began searching which meant that the Barber and Stolz got arrested but again they escaped only to be mistaken for hynkel and consequently takes his poistion . SPEECH THAT CHAPLIN MAKES AT THE END IS FANTASTIC IT COMPLIES THE MORALS WHICH SOCIETY COULD ONLY DREAM ABOUT . IN THE SPEECH IT CONTRADICTS THE WHOLE MEANING OF THE FILM BECAUSE OF THE SERIOUNESS AND SINCERENITY WHICH IT ENTAILED AND IT DEFINATELY WORKS BECAUSE DID WALK OUT FEELING GUILTY ABOUT HOW WE LIVE OUR LIVES LOOKING AT THE SMALLEST THING SUCH AS BEING IGNORANT TO SOMEONE TO THE BIGGEST MOST PROMINENT THINGS SUCH AS WAR .
11914_7.txt,1, Toy Soldiers is an okay action movie but what really stands out is the amount of effort that the scriptwriters and director put into portraying American counter forces accurately . Just check out the end credits are more than a dozen US military officers and officials listed . The movie accurately portrays the FBI as having control of the hostage situation but turning it over the US Army's Delta Force are unnamed in the movie as the Pentagon was still denying their existence at this time once the President waived the Posse Commitatus Act of US Code . The US Army forces at the end are accurately dressed and armed for the time . And even the use of an AH Apache for air support might seem a bit over the top is not terribly unrealistic . Far more expensive and frankly better movies have portrayed American counter forces with far less accuracy .
12420_10.txt,1, Just got around to seeing Monster Man yesterday . It had been a long wait and after lots of anticipation and build up I'm glad to say that it came through and met my expectations on every level . True you really ca n't expect too much from hearing the plot rundown but after reading some of the reviews for it was ecstatic . mean what trash fan would n't want to see a gore flick about a deranged inbred hick mowing people down with his make monster truck ? went in expecting a cross between Road Trip and The Hills Have Eyes and got so much more . This was a horror comedy that actually worked . The film makers got it right when it came to making you squirm and making you howl with laughter at the same time . Kudos to Michael Davis for going all out with the gore and pushing the envelope with the sickass humor . Let me list just a few reasons why love this movie so much First off is the story . It's been done to death in so many other flicks . college guy gets wind that his childhood crush is getting married . He being the year old virgin that he is hops in his Vista Cruiser and decides to take the road trip to confess his love hoping that she will fall head over hills and all that good jive . Hidden in the backseat of his station wagon is good buddy Harley . Harley is the loudmouth former friend who laughs and talks just like Jack Black in High Fidelity . You ca n't help but like the guy but if he was your friend in real life you'd have to keep a whiffle ball bat handy all you want but have you ever been hit with one ? to keep him in check . So he's a little on the obnoxious side to say the least but you can tell that he's a loyal friend deep down . they're on the road and when they stop in a bar they aggravate the locals . Now they're being stalked by a leatherface clone in a monster truck . That's it . Yeah along the way they pick up a gorgeous hitchhiker but I'm too lazy and hungover to go into that right now . so just watch the damn movie . Second thing love was the humor . This one had some of the sickest laughs of any movie since Cabin Fever . Just how messed up is it ? Well wo n't even go into the whole cat scene and as for the corpse burrito'' thing I'll leave that to your virgin eyes as well . The bar full of amputees was somewhat disturbing and that guy who looked like John Turturro bothered me too . Harley although a totally obnoxious frat type can really sling off the one liners . Love the clogs by the way . need a new pair . The GORE . This one pours it on heavy . While the first hour plays out as a demented road comedy the last third is all about blood and guts . If the movie had n't kept such a light tone throughout it would have been a little disturbing but seeing how it was all played for laughs there is no way possible that you will be bothered by it . If you're still in your seat by the time it comes you'll probably see the humor in it too but seriously there were buckets and buckets of the red stuff . There was a big plot turn that DID N'T see coming and when the credits rolled was completely satisfied . had gotten exactly what came for and I'm really glad that bought it . Much like Cabin Fever it's going to get a lot of replay . The Look of the movie was outstanding . There was this deliberately cheap look that made the whole thing scream late and loved the exaggerated colors . It's obvious that Monster Man was done on a relatively low budget but much like Cabin Fever keep comparing the two it actually works in the movie's favor . Cabin Fever was an ode to the greats this was the answer to that . So take that for what it's worth . No CGI here . This is what we all needed . I'm not exactly sure why it did n't get a theatrical release because this is everything that Jeepers Creepers SHOULD have been . Thank god for Lions Gate .
10914_7.txt,1, Hollywood movies since the have treated gays as lepers . In condemning homosexuality the film industry has reflected only what the repressive society of its day espoused as an ideology . For example in the Otto Preminger melodrama Advise and Consent straight actor Don Murray was cast as a queer congressman who commits suicide rather than confess his alternative lifestyle . Gay movie characters have covered a lot of ground since Advise and Consent . In the movie In Out out of heterosexual actor Kevin Kline is cast as a homosexual teacher who comes out of the closet on his wedding day . While the conservative Hollywood of yesteryear stipulated that the congressional queer in Advise and Consent'' had to commit suicide the liberal Hollywood of today dictates that the gay English teacher should be embraced rather than maced . Basically In Out'' preaches good citizenship in the garb of a politically correct comedy . Director Frank Oz and scenarist Scott Rudnick endorse honesty as the best policy because honesty always ensures happiness . High school teacher Howard Brackett Kline of The Big Chill'' will be happy only after he comes out of the closet just as his once fianc Emily Cusack will only feel happy when she can ditch her diet . Ultimately the movie contends that straight society will accept gays when homosexuals can act with greater honesty and candor about themselves . The happily outed gay tabloid reporter played by straight actor Tom Selleck here effectively dramatizes this open commentary . Rudnick's lightweight script embellishes the true life incident that occurred at the Oscars when Tom Hanks paid tribute to a high school teacher . In In Out Cameron Drake Dillon a blond Brad Pitt style bimbo type actor wins the Oscar for impersonating a fruity foot soldier . Drake honors his mentor Howard Brackett during his acceptance speech . Not contend to stop there the candid Cameron reveals to a live television audience that Howard is gay ! Suspicion paranoia and horror set in as the media descend upon the sleepy town of Green Leaf Indiana . would a no high school English teacher's sexual deviance spark such massive media concern ? Among those reporters lurks Peter Malloy Selleck of High Road to China'' and he wants to do a week exclusive one on Howard . Howard however wants nothing to do with the witch media especially the pesky Peter Malloy . Howard denies Drake's gay charges to everybody including his fianc and his mom . Malloy lingers because he smells a scoop . The revelation has turned Green Leaf upside down . High school principal Tom Halliwell Newhart squirms nervously with all the media coverage . Halliwell warns Howard that were his marriage not imminent he'd have to give him a pink slip . Meanwhile Peter bets Howard that his marriage to Emily will fall through at the last moment and he'll be there to record the result on camera . Howard resorts to audio tapes about macho men . He struggles to reform himself . But Howard's efforts are futile . Guilt swells up inside him . And then there is Peter Malloy who rags him to come clean about his homosexuality . Finally at the altar in the sight of God Howard bursts . Of course bride Emily Montgomery is floored by Howard's gay confession . Predictably the school fires Howard but he shows up for graduation . Drake shows up too and rushes to Brackett's defense . Not only has the school stripped Howard of his job but they've also given his teacher award to somebody else . Drake appeals to the principal and wins Howard the unanimous support of the community . The biggest defect in Rudnick's contrived script is Howard himself . Rudnick has created a character too chaste to be true either by gray or straight standards . Howard Brackett looms as more of a saint than a sinner . He helps one student gain admission to college and he coaches the track team . How often do you hear of an English teacher doubling as a coach too ? Everybody at his high school adores Howard . He does n't have a mean bone in his body . Further Rudnick and Oz ask us to believe that nobody else in Green Leaf is gay . Where are Howard's gay friends ? Are they too scared to come to his defense ? No In Out'' is not targeted strictly at homosexual audiences . Oz whose screen credits include cute comedies like Dirty Rotten Scoundrels'' and House Sitter as well as Rudnick teeter on a politically correct tightrope . In Out'' is not a gay recruiting movie . The filmmakers show no interest in what prompted either Howard or Peter Malloy to prefer the gay lifestyle . Instead Oz and Rudnick are only interested in shoring up a thin premise Is he or is n't he gay ? They flesh it out to involve the community response to the answer . Finally when Howard admits that he is gay the filmmakers devote the rest of the movies to showing how a conservative Norman Rockwell town can accept him despite his difference . The most shocking scenes in In Out'' is probably when tabloid reporter Malloy does a lip lock on Howard . Straight guys kissing each other in a movie about a gay identity crisis are as hilarious as they are phony . Kline and Selleck grind their faces together in what appears as more of a head collision than a closed kiss . Nothing at all like the controversial British movie Priest In Out'' emerges as an engaging but labored piece of social propaganda with its okay message . If Ellen'' were n't the TV equivalent In Out'' would probably be heading toward TV as a new sitcom . Watching In Out'' is not so much about dealing with the issue of gay or straight but how to be a decent person in the last days of the century . What makes In Out'' a tolerable comedy about sexual intolerance is its equal opportunity cheers and jeers about queers and steers .
11409_9.txt,1, was recently at a sleepover birthday party with five other girls all my age All of us thinking it would be some harmless little movie such as Jaws decided to rent it along with Rat Race . watched Rat Race after When a Stranger Calls as to ease our fear . We put the movie on at at night and lay together in our sleeping bags hiding behind covers for most of it . screamed five times which is unusual for me as get scared in movies but never scared enough to actually scream . All of us were terrified to even leave the bedroom as we were all positive the Stalker as we called him for some reason get us . played a mean trick one everyone was all dozing off once Rat Race was over hid under my sleeping bag and said quietly and lowly HAVE YOU CHECKED THE CHILDEN ? They all SCREAMED like nuts and were so scared . All in all would rate this movie a The only thing did n't like was that There were too many false alarms when Jill thinks the Stalker is there and The kids never woke up during the whole thing until Jenkins kidnapped them and hid them in the cupboard at which time all they did was cry like babies . would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes thriller . But one thing AM SO NOT BABYSITTING PAST PM EVER AGAIN
350_10.txt,1, Ever since Nintendo has been making great video games such as Super Mario and Zelda . Most ideas would get a bit boring after years . Games made by Nintendo never seem to get boring because they're always adding something new . It went from arcade games to the Wii and hear that there's a new version of the Wii scheduled for release in The thing that makes Wii games so different is the fact that your actually doing something instead of just sitting on the couch pushing buttons . And have more good news . Super Mario Galaxy is to be released in
1108_8.txt,1, OK. warning for anyone out there who is a parent or guardian . Be careful about who you see this film with ie DO NOT TAKE KIDS TO SEE THIS FILM . I'll explain why . the title is misleading and the film has nothing to do with romance assume this was fully intentional on the producers behalf but is annoying the film itself is really very very disturbing . have some problems first is the fact that the film is neither violent or sexual and therefore is not a film But it IS a very disturbing film involves a child and his parents and a small town . OK it boils down to this . The film is not suitable for minors because it contains sequences and images that are unsettling and would be confusing to a child . Is has a bizarre quality to it and its ONLY because it has a child in it that makes me feel its unsuitable . As a parent myself feel strongly enough to want to tell people because read only the other day that it is having a release in theatres . hope im not offending the film makers by saying this but think its my right because its getting a release and has an rating only . its not violent or sexual Just weird and unsettling but pretty good in and of itself .
9220_8.txt,1, Um hello . Rainbow Brite . the name alone is hard to take it seriously like she could be the cousin of Strawberry Shortcake . but when you're a kid this is definitely serious stuff . So there's this vile snotty spoiled girl and she wants Rainbow Brites belt amongst other things ie the light of the whole universe and Rainbow Brite and her friend Cris are bound and determined to stop her . As remember Murky and Lurky had a minor role in this production . Maybe they wanted too much money ? So anyway snotty evil girl has a powerful jewel and she channels it's power to take Rainbow's belt . imagine ? But somehow Rainbow gets her belt back and re it with star sprinkles'' and kicks the bad girls butt with the help of Cris and his prism bracelet and they also save the whole universe in the process . So good triumphs over evil niceness triumphs over rudeness and Rainbow Brite and the Color Kids are once again safe to spread color and joy for all mankind .
10213_7.txt,1, saw this years ago and it's entertaining but not profound . The basic story is of a young man who dreams of Midian though he's not sure where it is or even if it really exists . Spoilers Follow He finally visits it gets transformed to a Nightbreed creature by being bitten by another one . Then he has to help the other members of the Nightbreed because they're being attacked by Canadians . for the accents they all act like Good Ol Boys . Not much in tune with the Canadian psyche eh ? Someone observed for monsters'' or Nightbreed substitute Jews and for the Canadians substitute Nazis and you're supposed to get an insight into the struggle by the monsters versus the humans . Well maybe . One major objection had was that while the underground city was interesting it was rather ramshackle and frankly dirty . This must be a convention for movies with underground settlements . One would think that if the monsters were the good guys some would have at least a little sense of decor . The storyline is a tad thin but that's to introduce characters . But it's entertaining enough for a repeat view .
4246_9.txt,1, The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency . Putney Swope is on the board for no other reason than the fact that he is black and the agency needs a token'' on the board . Swope is ignoring the meeting reading Jet magazine at the big table and everybody is ignoring Swope . Suddenly the CEO croaks on the spot . No time is wasted . janitor is called to haul off the corpse and the board immediately and unceremoniously tackles the business of electing a new CEO . And as the votes are tallied one by one the tension is built up and then finally snapped in a hilariously ironic climax to the vote that gives the viewer a delicious dish of logical implications to savor for the rest of the movie . If you've ever talked back to some stupid television commercial you'll like seeing this movie . Too bad there do n't seem to be any real Putney Swopes in the world .
4708_10.txt,1, My ex wife and saw and were intrigued by the trailer for this film . We waited for it to come out but when it did it did n't stay in theaters very long . Several years later bought it on VHS and am transferring it to DVD so can preserve it . found it to be very moving . It is about real events in a real country . BURMA got such a bad reputation for the political oppression it created that they changed their name . find women with little make on to be very sexy . Patricia Arquette is in this movie . Frances McDormand and Spalding Gray are in it only briefly . After coming home to find her young son and husband brutally murdered Laura is afraid of blood . bad trait for a doctor . Her sister talks her into going on a vacation to Burma . While there she witnesses a peaceful demonstration and has her passport stolen . In a bold stupid move she asks a tourist guide to show her something off the tourist track . Her guide is injured by soldiers and she spends the rest of the movie trying to get him and herself to safety . Every time watch this it reminds me that we in the United States forget that to a peasant living under military rule SOCIALISM where at least eating is virtually guaranteed looks pretty darn good .
6231_9.txt,1, really really liked this one . know it's rampant with what are now clich plot lines and plenty of overacting but it was hell of a lot of fun . In our quest for and horror cheese we come across many flicks that are so bad they're good . We also have some that are so they suck and then we have some that are so bad they are just bad . This is definitely so bad it's good . Some teens traveling come across an in the middle of nowhere a forgotten slice of roadside America and they decide to it out . They cross every line of inappropriate until it is absurd and they pay for it . They pay dearly . would not normally give a movie like this a but the girls in this one are the type that we miss from the ditzy scantily and FIT . These are n't the anorexic broads from today's horrible horror they look awesome in booty shorts . give it a out of kids .
9694_10.txt,1, should n't like Jackass Number Two . No one should . There is and never has been anything particularly redeeming about Jackass . And yet . one of the funniest things have ever seen and simply can not explain why . This new movie leaves the first one in the dust . It's so funny so horrible and so wrong . The whole team give their all with Jackss in chief Knoxville leading the charge . He's nuts . adore him but he's insane . And more power to him . With his burgeoning film career he could have sat back and just let everyone else do the dirty work but the fact that he threw himself almost literally back into the world of the so wholeheartedly makes me oddly respect him . More kudos must go to Bam Margera who previously seemed content to sit back and just make sure everyone around him did pretty much what he wanted . Here Bam is n't the tormentor but the tormented and is all the better for it . simply ca n't say what my favourite part is because laughed the whole way through . Admittedly viewed much of the movie from between my fingers but there has n't been a movie I've seen in a very long time that made me feel as invigorated as this did . Love them or most probably hate them the Jackass team have delivered above and beyond my expectations . But do agree with Bam . There can never be a Jackass number three because someone will die and want these guys to stick around .
342_10.txt,1, am a big follower of Indian Movies especially Malayalam and Tamil . Shame on India for not sending this movie as their official Oscar entry . have seen this movie and it has clearly revealed to me the maturity Tamil cinema has in its screenplay and narrative which bollywood better catch up with . the way to all we westerners Tamil Cinema is more qualitative and very different from Bollywood which is all about good looks glamour and promotion . Coming to the point what was India thinking when they sent a movie like to the Oscars ? That was a really a Masochist move . think they are trying to punish Oscar judges with boredom by sending Devdas since the judges toppled Lagaan last year . is just a brigthly colored but stale and predictable melodrama of Love fate and destiny . would keep away from it . Anyway not sending a movie like Kanathil Muthital shows how much of a revamp Indian administration needs to save them from poor administrators who lack intelligence . Now know why this country has so many issues . They are heavily talented but not showcased properly .
12172_8.txt,1, First of all am from munich where this movie takes place and believe it or not there are guys like Erkan and Stefan including the silly dialect ! know their comedy show from the beginning and my main fear was that the movie is just an assembling of their already known jokes but it is not ! The jokes are evolved through the story and make in their own special way sense . But if you absolutely dislike Erkan und Stefan hands of this movie . Everyone else it's worth viewing !
8988_7.txt,1, Young Warriors While this is a deeply flawed in some ways idiotic movie the way it continually defies expectations makes it decent viewing for the adventurous sleaze fan . Meet yuppie college student Kevin and his gang of lovable frat boy buddies . In what starts out as a particularly egregious teen sex comedy we follow this bunch of jerk and their antics which involve among other things making pledges tie bricks to their genitals . The movie abruptly shifts gears when Kevin's high school freshman sister is brutally raped and beaten into a coma by a gang of bikers who apparently have nothing better to do . When she dies in the hospital Kevin vows revenge much to the chagrin of his detective father . So far we've gone from Porky's through Last House On The Left territory into what is apparently shaping up to be your typical urban vigilante revenge flick . However Kevin and his gang's portrayal goes from vaguely sympathetic until they become kill lunatics . It's to the film's credit that it does n't glamorize the fascist anti rhetoric that Kevin continually spouts while still making it understandable that he would feel the way he does . The mood goes from lighthearted to grimy and downbeat very quickly and by the end it's so over the top and exploitative that it'll leave you incredulous . And that's the strength of this film . You never know what to expect next . At over minutes it's a little lengthy for this kind of fare but you wo n't get bored . Poorly acted for the most part with cardboard cutouts for characters and some particularly ludicrous situations and rather stupid dialogue this wo n't be topping anyone's list of forgotten classics anytime soon . got a kick out of it though and I'm sure anyone reading this knows if they're up for it .
1632_7.txt,1, read Angels and Demons about years ago and can honestly say to is one of the few books that could n't put down while reading . The movie however was pretty much what expected a lot of action with somewhat of a mystery storyline . Tom Hanks plays in my opinion a much better role of Professor Langdon than in The Da Vinci Code . You wo n't have to worry about this being as bad as The Da Vinci Code this is everything that it was n't . Much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy . If you have n't read the book no worries you will still find it very interesting . And if you have read the book well lets say you might be a little let down because found many scenes missing that was looking forward to . Overall Pretty impressive film for any everyday movie goer . But maybe not something too special for Dan Brown fans .
166_7.txt,1, Story about three eclipse even Indigo ha children beginning their love for murder . Oh and the people who are hot'' on their trail . Bloody Birthday a pretty mediocre title for the film was a nice lil surprise . was in no way expecting a film that dealt with blood psychopath kids . And may say it's also one of the best flicks I've seen with kids as the villains . By the end of the movie seriously wanted these kids to die in horrible fashion . It's a really solid horror flick but how these kids are getting away with all this mayhem and murder is just something that you ca n't not think about . Even the slightest bit of investigation would easily uncover these lil sh ! as the murderers . But there seems to be only a couple police in town well by the end only one and he seemed like a dimwit so suppose they could have gotten away with it . Haha yeah and I'm a Chinese jet Nevertheless this movie delivered some evilass kids who were more than entertaining a lot of premarital sex and a decent amount of boobage . No kiddin ! If you're put off by the less than stellar title dash it from your mind and give this flick a shot . It's a very recommendable and underrated horror flick .
3645_7.txt,1, As have said before am NOT a fan of Tweety . He's just so aggravating wish Sylvester would just eat him and get it over with . In this cartoon Sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans . He spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he spys Tweety is one of the passengers . The ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and Sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness . If only for once he's succeed by chewing and swallowing thus finishing of the irritating Canary forever . But as cartoons starring Tweety go this one is quite good but it's ALL thanks to that brilliant cat .
4589_10.txt,1, Most people are totally unaware that this movie exists . Fox which paid Judge to make it has kept it in the can for quite awhile and then spent nothing to promote it . guess that made many people think it was one of the garbage movies being flushed in late summer . Well am here to tell you that this is a funny and rather frightening look at a future that is not that hard to believe . Basically Judge puts forward the notion that the stupid are outbreeding the smart by a wide margin . Then these stupid are getting more stupid by basically spending all of their time watching TV and having sex which produces more stupid people . By a person of average intelligence today will appear to be a genius that talks all faggy . Seriously is this really that hard to believe . Oh sure this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid but still plausible . Luke Wilson is great as the time traveling army guy hopelessly trying to get back to a more comfortable time . Where this story will gain its cult status is with the numerous funny one like can we family style her'' and hey man I'm here ! This is a funny movie and a rather sharp social commentary on an American society that seems to be fatuated with self pleasure comfort and stupidity and guarantee you that will be buying this on DVD the first day it comes out and watching it over and over .
9706_7.txt,1, Just got out of an advance screening and wow was this movie hilarious . Possibly better than the first one but at least its equal . If you do n't like jackass or really unnecessary amounts of male nudity more than in the first then stay far far away . But if you dig the whole Jackass thing then this movie will not disappoint . Toro Totter is the greatest invention ever . OK. so my review was n't long enough . All else have to say is poor poor Dunn they really kick the crap out of him in this . So if you enjoy masochistic humor and prolific male nudity and by far the most disgusting female nudity ever Waters is involved need say more ? then this movie will keep you in stitches for it entirety . never stopped laughing and actually came out drenched in sweat .
10018_8.txt,1, have certainly not seen all of Jean Rollin's films but they mostly seem to be bloody vampire naked women fests which if you like that sort of thing is not bad but this is a major departure and could almost be Cronenberg minus the bio nightmarish stuff . Except it's in French with subtitles of course . man driving on the road at night comes across a woman that is in her slippers and bathrobe and picks her up while in the background yet another woman lingers wearing nothing . As they drive along it's obvious that there is something not right about the woman in that she forgets things almost as quickly as they happen . Still though that does n't prevent the man from having sex with her once they return to Paris his apartment . The man leaves for work and some strangers show up at his place and take the woman away to this block a huge apartment building referred to as the Black Tower where others of her kind whom the memory things seems to be the least of their problems are being held for some reason . Time and events march by in the movie which involve mostly trying to find what's going on and get out of the building for this woman and she does manage to call Robert the guy that picked her up in the first place to come rescue her . The revelation as to what's going on comes in the last few moments of the movie which has a rather strange yet touching end to it . In avoiding what seemed to be his typical'' formula Rollin created in this what feel is his most fascinating and disturbing film . like this one a lot check it out . out of
3075_7.txt,1, Might contain spoilers . This is just a good movie . Lots of good silly stuff to laugh at . However do not watch the TV version they cut to much out . Dom Deluise is rather awesome as the mafia Don who is hired to kill Robin . All can say about his ten minutes it's a long drive from Jersey . Also you got ta love them checking the script to make sure Robin gets another shot . Also Century Fox . Any bad stuff ? The rappers at the beginning and the end seem rather out dated . The songs were rather lame . One time while watching this movie could think out a few more times when they could have thrown in another joke or On the whole however an enjoyable movie experience . must watch for comedy fans .
4848_10.txt,1, had to call my mother WASP to ask her about this . Was it really that bad in the in New York ? Surprise she could n't remember . So told her to see the movie . Arthur Miller in not a screen play but a NOVEL for a change was when he wrote this in It is a painful depiction of anti Yet oddly enough there is a tender story of human relationships the Jew with Newman the non primarily underlying the cruel story . The acting is competent and the cinematography is very good . The only reason can think of for this not making it big in the theatre is that it's aaagh controversial . actually give it ten of ten . Maybe a bit high but it's so worth seeing .
6512_7.txt,1, do n't understand why this movie has such a low rating . It totally deserves more ! Sure it's completely ridiculous but that's what it was supposed to be . Do n't expect cinematic transcendence from a movie about beauty pageant contestants stranded on a Caribbean island ! What you should expect is a huge spoof of pretty much every relevant sci fantasy and block movie in cinematic history and even references to other spoofers . All completely exaggerated and sometimes totally unnecessary but that's exactly what makes this movie stand out . If you like parodies and enjoy say Leslie Nielsen or Mike Myers you're gon na love this . sure did !
6202_7.txt,1, enjoyed this series but felt that the whole thing was let down by the sound recording For whatever reason they've had to employ an awful lot of what's called ADR where the actors replace the original location sound with a re of it in a sound booth . The reasons for doing this are usually due to problems at the location or because somebody screwed up somewhere in the sound production chain . It would n't be so bad if the ADR was done well but at times it's just plain distracting . It's not just the ADR that's the problem the sound mix just does n't match up to the quality of performances and the pictures . I'd be curious to know what went wrong .
12052_8.txt,1, I've never seen a Bollywood film before but caught the first ten minutes of this laughed myself silly and hit the button on Sky I'm glad did ! hope do n't insult anybody basically the BF and loved it ! but we could n't take it half as seriously as the actors did especially the obsessed one understand is a huge Bollywood star because we've seen him on the cover of lots of dvds since and even saw a doll of him today in Hamleys ! The BF keeps on about this bloke am beginning to think HE'S obsessed ! He keeps saying that it's strange for the traditionally good looking one to be the anti of a film ! But then we do like films that are n't your stock predictable Hollywood fare It was completely over the top but really good fun . If all Bollywood films are like this then we're watching more . have had that bloomin song in my head all week and ca n't speak a word of Hindi ! PS any recommendations would be appreciated !
3765_7.txt,1, It took me a while to find this movie since they do n't have it yet on DVD my VCR is not worth hooking up again guess all the referencing to drug use is too much for some folks . But found a decent bootleg on Ebay and must say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is just retarded . It is a slap stick spoof in the vein of Airplane . must say that when watched it on Showtime or Spotlight growing up in the enjoyed the humor a whole lot more then than do now . But it's definitely worth watching just to see what they movie makers were able to get away with before the Just Say No'' hypocrites unleashed their propaganda . sing . are all on drugs'' hahaha It's a silly film and worth the paid off of Ebay to get it on DVD just do n't even think about comparing it to the original that's just plain stupid . What are you high ?
4067_8.txt,1, Contains Spoiler The movie is a good action but do n't know if the director cut too many parts but it seems that the bad guy die too fast . The end of the movie come the bad guy dies and that's it . The special effects are good and do n't regret paying to see it at the theatre .
2864_9.txt,1, Okay marked this spoiler so do n't be upset when wrap this up . Now went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie . And was right as almost every horror flick have ever seen it was predictable but not as bad as most . What helped was the story did not expect there to be a WHY'' to Kane's madness . But there was and while somewhat foggy you still got the idea and understand the madness . Now of course if you like something that will scare you for nights to come this is not the movie your looking for . But if your a fan of Saw or some other movies that claim their fame thanks to sadistic content this is a movie to watch . Now where really throw in a spoiler for a second warning . give this movie a perhaps because I'm a fan of the WWE and a fan of Kane but who does n't like a movie a little bit better when it stars somebody we love . However this movie could have scored a for me IF . at the end of the movie when it showed Kane dead on the pavement . While a dog pissing in his eye was CUTE'' it could have been classic with the Kane quick sit up and turn of the head . perfect would have been awarded if that would have happened . It was a perfect opportunity but either the WWE did n't think of that or a future sequel will begin with that very sequence mentioned . That's all .
5205_10.txt,1, Apart from the low budget there never seems to be more than Germans in one scene at any one time plus the same half tracks this film is absolute top class . Everything is accurate . That is the point think from the uniforms to to the horror and the disillusionment . is as grey as the field grey uniforms . Grey men with the life drained out of them . Forget US made Gung ho rubbish like Blackhawk down and Private Ryan . This is one of the best war films ever . Only Cross of Iron beats this for tension and story . Please could we have a proper Un German language with English subtitles version in the UK Without having to pay ridiculous import charges from Europe . Most other DVD's are multilingual . Why not this one

4585_10.txt,1, am rating this an because of the premise of the film . The acting was fine there was n't anyone that stood out as amazing or appalling . It is disturbingly true that intelligent people are having less and less children or choose to have none at all . dumb ass in supporters are procreating like rabbits . And though do n't believe the earth will actually exist in years can see Mike Judge's parodied prophet coming to be as life imitating art . The world is being run by idiots and it will get worse as the intelligent free people become the minority and the git done'' fans outnumber them . The proof is our farce of an election . But digress . If you are fortunate enough to have this playing in your city go see it . have paid my plus popcorn to see FAR WORSE rubbish than this Movie or Napoleon Dynamite anyone ? There are laughs there are cringes but overall this is entertaining . If you have half a brain you will think to yourself how this movie though funny is spot on and a bit uncanny . I'm not surprised AT ALL that this movie is almost completely unknown as Fox was the one distributing this and they would n't want any of their sheep to see this and think maybe WILL read a book and not watch or or my balls If our society does n't stop the dumbing down of everything the bastardisation of the English language Mr. Bush then this really is where we are going .
1050_9.txt,1, This is a delightful they kind of film . Well performed by everyone and peopled with interesting character actors . An intelligent witty script acted with the right blend of broad comedy and understated humor . Holds up for repeated viewings . the re of this film with the same name directed by Arnold Whatwashethinking is an unbearable mess painful to watch without a scintilla of the charm and wit of the original .
2784_10.txt,1, young Frenchman uproots himself as he becomes an Erasmus exchange student in Barcelona and comes back a better man . Sounds boring ? No way ! The movie is filled with colourful people all of them stereotypes British twat and her racist brother the sexually liberated Dane the ultra German In this case though the stereotypes are brilliantly done . You feel like you know people like that for one know an arrogant doctor and his trophy wife and they're just like the characters in the film ! they feel like REAL PEOPLE ! Go see this movie and enjoy the subtitles !
2809_7.txt,1, The movie is good and think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful . liked the movie . Can anyone tell me how can get hold of the songs from this movie ? Even the soundtrack will do . If that's not possible can at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers ? tried to look up amazon . but its not there . tried CD baby not there either . browsed through Google to get some details but there were n't any . would appreciate it if someone could give me the answer to my question . know that the songs belong to Country Music and is sung by a country artist . just need the title names along with the singer . would recommend this movie or rather the songs to any country loving person .
6830_9.txt,1, The movie was good . Really the only reason watched it was Alan Rickman . Which he did n't pull off the southern accent he did pretty well with it . Emma Thompson did really good she definitely pulled off the southern accent . like all the character in my opinion not one of them did bad thing have notice . have read all these comment and not one person has comment on Alan shadow . Which made him look even better and he pretty much had one through the whole movie . would give the movie a out of Another one of my opinions is the movie would been better if there was n't any sex . Still it was alright . Love the scene were he says Aw sh when he is setting in his car and see them in his mirror .
7622_8.txt,1, This movie is kind of good . It seem that they used the Tyrannosaurus Rex like a blown up balloon just like Godzilla just maybe back in those days scientist have n't got enough info . on all sorts of dinosaurs . Back in those time scientist still making dinosaur so guess this movie was base on a Tyrannosaurus Rex movements back in the There even a part where a giant rock fired by someone at the Tyrannosaurus Rex it damage the Tyrannosaurus Rex and it was knock out for a little while . At the end the Tyrannosaurus Rex went back to search for food . There is something wrong in the movie as well like a rifle how can one rifle kill a Tyrannosaurus Rex when it could be stronger than we are . If this film going to make a remake suggest make it more good and excited because watching a old movie seems like to have a remake of it if lucky .
8562_10.txt,1, watched this film with my family over a long Thanksgiving holiday weekend . am thankful that someone insisted that we watch it though did n't pay much attention until the end of the film when a head shearing seems promised but alas does n't happen . On the other hand watched this movie some years later and loved its liveliness absurdity sparkle and just plain fun . think that the film has a female tone . Women are not exploited in it even though am sure that someone might think that the movie is pure exploitation . think the movie plays with tropes of the period . keep thinking someone ought to remake it . And flesh out some of the implications in the original .
8208_7.txt,1, Following the advice of a friend got myself this movie . I'm very fond of computers in general hence why a film about identity theft on the Internet could not be left unseen . had some bad echoes about it but in the end was n't so disappointed the story though classical is kind of interesting and must have been really new back in the days when it was released in theatres . was gladly surprised when figured out that contrary to what we usually see computer actions are somehow realistic as they use Windows and normal computers . The storytelling is median and not bothering the viewer . The end is typically American . The actors performance is globally OK Sandra Bullock usually annoys me with her oh my god why me'' way to behave but this time she seems to have controlled herself . I'd recommend that movie .
3324_9.txt,1, feel very strongly that this film was just like Waiting to Exhale with white females in the As in Waiting to Exhale all of the female characters got mixed up with men who were either married or no good . The only difference besides the obvious was that there was n't much humor in this film . would even say that it was tragic . Only one of the male characters seemed to be kind and sincere Lange's guy but even then there was conflict in this relationship . The story was about three young women who shared an apartment together and who had hopes and dreams of success . Unfortunately for them romance did n't seem to come easy although they were young intelligent and attractive . This movie could be called a tearjerker with the saddest part involving Suzy Parker's character whose obsession of an ex leads to tragedy . This is a must see .
575_7.txt,1, This is a pretty obscure dumb horror movie set in the Everglades . It is really stupid and lame for the first half then it actually starts to get good for the last half . There is a scene with the hero running to save his friends interspersed with shots of a church group singing do n't know . It is mesmerizing . was impressed with the night time scenes because it actually looked like night unlike most low budget horror films where it still looks like daytime . feel like the director was really talented but was working with a miniscule budget and a tough schedule . There are a few scenes towards the end the one mentioned above and also the end credits that are extremely cool . This movie could have been a genuine classic if it left its Scooby Doo conventions behind and went straight for the throat . was surprised at how good this movie turned out to be . could n't take my eyes off of it and had to ask myself why ?
10542_10.txt,1, this movie is the best horror movie have ever seen . the acting is terrible and the plot leaves a lot to be desired but the puppet gave me nightmares for weeks . seriously if you have little kids do n't let them see this . of course am a little biased because of an irrational fear of puppets and midgets . also a body double cameo by the guy who does mini me verne troyer . and some gratuitous nudity a must in any low budget horror movie . all other horror movies will forever be judged against this in my book .
5402_7.txt,1, so . was completely in love with this movie . gaga for it even with all its plot twists . the one thing found really disturbing was the connection between the two best friends in Tim and Kyle . While the writer of the film gave us such a poignant moment between the two and their sexual experimentation he then gives us a plot twist that makes them half brothers ? the subject is n't brought up in the film . left unexplained and unaccounted for just thought that it was in bad taste and the fact that it was n't even discussed is even worse . we've created a taboo . let's not address the situation because that would n't really be Otherwise a spectacular film
9977_7.txt,1, When first saw the movie being advertised thought it was going to be another Disney movie that almost goes straight to video . finally got around and rented it . thought it was going to be bad because could n't see Shia in any other role than his recently cancelled show Even Stevens'' When turned it on was ready to turn it off from boredom in about ten minutes . It started a bit slow and could n't understand the beginning because the years did n't make sense then they explained that later in the show so was relieved of wondering about that . All and all thought it was a good movie and would recommend it . The cast was top notch and even though i'm not a fan of golf it easily kept my attention with a good plot .
8134_7.txt,1, This was Laurel and Hardy's last silent film for Roach Studios . However since the public had a real thirst for talkies'' this same short was re by the team just a few years later with only a few small plot changes . LAUGHING GRAVY was essentially the same plot except that Stan and Ollie were trying to hide a cute puppy from their grouchy landlord a goat like in ANGORA LOVE . This whole goat angle is the worst part of the film . While you could understand the boys wanting to keep a cute little dog all it is snowy outside why exactly they bring a goat home is just contrived and pointless . According to the plot the goat followed them home and so they got tired of shooing it away and kept it . Huh ? This just does n't make any sense it had been a giraffe or a cow would they have done the same thing ? Apart from being an unconvincing plot the movie itself is pure Laurel and Hardy with a familiar plot and familiar roles for the comedians . This film features quite a few laughs but unfortunately is n't one of their better films to wrap up their silent careers . This aspect of their careers just seems to have ended with a whimper .
3548_8.txt,1, respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration music I'll do each one separately Nicolas Roeg Verdi story about an assassination attempt in Vienna . Theresa Russell wife plays a man ! Not bad beautiful and exotic . Russell is great . Charles Sturridge No story but there is some haunting black and white imagery that fits perfectly with the music . Jean Godard Baptiste Lully . Horrendous . Pointless boring no plot no nothing . Filled with gratuitous female nudity . The worst ! Julien Temple Buck Henry Beverly D'Angelo and Anita Morris star in this funny if obvious story about a cheating couple . Pretty good . Bruce Beresford Korngold . Short lush and romantic . Very good . Robert Altman Rameau . Dull . yawner . Fran Roddam Wagner . This has Bridget Fonda in her film debut . Beautifully done love story with a fairly explicit sex scene . Ken Russell Puccini . Really strange but OK. Derek Jarman Chapentier . Lyrical look at youth and old age . Very sweet . The last is by Bill Bryden doing Pagliacci'' He has John Hurt dressed as a clown lip to Caruso When this came out it almost got an rating the abundant nudity and the sex scene It was given an with a strict warning attached saying the rating would be heavily enforced . After the film bombed that warning disappeared . The idea is n't bad and out of the segments were worthwhile . Worth seeing even if you do n't like opera . Just avoid the Godard segment . I'm giving it an
10533_10.txt,1, had such high hopes for Teletoon Retro to air this but instead of having shows such as this ones that do n't get the treatment that they deserve they air things that may have seen dozens of times before . The Centurions was the highlight of my pre years . know that may seem a little bit clich but it's true . After Duke from Joe Jake Rockewell is another one of those cartoon characters that really had a crush on . It's too bad that Teletoon Retro does n't see it the same way people of my generation do . Otherwise Teletoon Retro would be a lot better than it is .
2829_10.txt,1, And that's saying a lot . Rent this if you want to be staggered by oddness blown away by one of the most bizarre scripts direction and casting in the history of films . I'm staggered . ca n't believe watched it . I'm a big Bernadette Peters fan normally but this tested my resolve . Do n't read any more reviews here it's best if you know nothing about the plot . Just rent it . You wo n't believe what you're seeing .
6365_7.txt,1, lot of people do n't think Dan Aykroyd is funny . This movie proves otherwise . Aykroyd is brilliant delivering his one in this comedy . The only major problem with this is that it wastes far too much time near the end jumping back and forth from Aykroyd's character and the doctor who is pursuing him to prove he's a fraud . The doctor goes nuts like doctor Leo Marvin Dreyfuss in What About Bob ? The scenes where the doctor is desperately trying to get back to Los Angeles are silly unbelievable and unfunny . Other that this aspect the movie really is funny especially the first half .
9864_8.txt,1, Im a huge Lillard fan that's why ended up watching this movie . Honestly doubt that if he was n't in the movie would of enjoyed it as much or even watched it but once did watch it realize the story was pretty decent . bad ending must say but did see it coming . It's a low budget movie and some of the actors were n't really good but all in all rated this movie The suspense of wondering what Lillard was actually up to was what really keeped me interested in this movie . Its a good rental !
6510_7.txt,1, Okay think we're all agreed that Michael Jackson was the low point . And the special effects too . But please keep in mind that this was NOT a big film okay ? Not every film gets as much of a budget as Harry Potter or Star Wars . However thought it was pretty funny altogether . Nothing that would in my opinion waste your time . Parodies are always fun to watch and just because it was n't big budget does n't mean it's bad . think this was a good movie if weak at some points . Hope this comment helps .
4668_8.txt,1, Especially after watching THE MATRIX RELOADED ! After seeing the Matrix with all it's ridiculous fantasy make characters with their super powers it was refreshing to see an action movie with real people in situations that involved actual risk ! cared about these people and even though some of the stunts seemed a bit much it still left me feeling like it's possible'' verses what a stupid video game'' the Matrix This movie is n't brain surgery it's very straight forward . Some things are predictable like knowing that someone is going to be a back and that someone early on is going to die . Pretty obvious but SO WHAT ? The first minutes sets up our reason our motive our main objective . like that Theron and Walhberg did n't have any make scenes . am glad that they did n't go there . They kept it about funny dialogue ESPECIALLY SETH GREENE . That guy IS FUNNY ! This is a movie that would buy when it comes out on DVD . It's fun fast and entertaining . The only thing guess it's a big thing is that we are really rooting for the bad guys . This group of protaganists are already on the wrong side of the law . Not a good message for the kiddies parents please explain this to them .
9589_10.txt,1, OK. for a bit of a rant think . It's been flamin years since submitted my original comments praising this top footy comedy . the damn thing still has n't made it to video or DVD for that matter even been repeated on the telly Does anyone out there know why not Has there been a BBC error whereby the original copy has been deleted Listen up you lot in charge of ITV whack this on to DVD now Do you even realise how funny this programme was It makes Mike Bassett'' look as bad as the current pants Spurs team . Rant over . For the moment .
7898_10.txt,1, do n't care if some people voted this movie to be bad . If you want the Truth this is a Very Good Movie ! It has every thing a movie should have . You really should Get this one .
11976_10.txt,1, If you want to have a great time then this is THE movie to watch . Take the premise There is this college which admits people with minimum qualifications of BA MA MBA MCA and BCA . So you have to take into account the time consumed and thus it is obvious that all students are Also the school admits students of a dispensation and has a course of in weight loss and the only student who failed this course is Manisha Koirala . Only she was a snake in the past life . Still not convinced ? OK read on . Here's a scene . Akshay Kumar a college student is chased by Arman and he takes out a bazooka and shoots him ! Then throws grenades . Then one of the grenades hits Akshay . But does n't die and continues to fight Arman the snake plunges a half foot dagger into Akshay and stomps on it but Akshay is still there . Then Akshay gets on a jet ski and follows Arman . They fight and Arman chokes Akshay underwater and finally Akshay is dead . So we think as soon as Arman is out of the picture Akshay swims away to Raj Babbar Principal of this college Boxing Refree Parapsychology ka professor mumbling priest . But no one repeat no one takes the cake but a certain Mr. Nigam . You gotto watch to learn more .
11269_7.txt,1, if you are dating a girl that is into wicca ! many parts of this movie were killer and the feeling you get from this movie while watching it and immediately after is enough alone to sit through it all but some things really bothered me about this film that cant really put my finger on . definitely think that this movie is one that any art student or photography student should see of the camera style and graininess that ive never seen but that is just it . looks like an art student made it and the plot if there is any is so jumpy that you really need to be on a lot of drugs to get just what is going on
5373_7.txt,1, family is traveling through the mid West . There's widower Ben Bateman his girlfriend Nicky Capri and Ben's little daughter Reischl Then hit a town named Hillsboro where everyone acts more than a little strangely . Their car breaks down and they're forced to stay . They soon find out a witches coven has a spell over the town and is up to incredible evil . The story is not that good . People just figure things out of nothing and they just happen to find out where the witches are at the end . Also there are a lot of loopholes left dangling at the end . The acting is pretty poor too . Bateman and Capri are bland and everybody else is about the same . Only old pros Strother Martin and Jones give good performances . Still this movie does work . It forgoes blood and gore some but this is PG and manges to work with some very creepy visuals and atmosphere . The acting hampers a lot of it but it still works . Martin especially chews the scenery in his role . ca n't explain exactly why of like this movie but it did work on me . It's a quiet kind of horror that is n't made anymore . Hardly a masterwork but this deserves to be rediscovered .
1515_7.txt,1, Well this is new . Italian horror director Lucio Fulci shoots a film about a famous Italian horror director called . Fulci . After years and years of witnessing gruesome horror sequences it becomes hard for Lucio to separate reality from fiction and he often hallucinates about committing violent murders . He quickly descends further into a seemly endless spiral of madness and unverifiable venom . Even the dedicated psychiatrist ca n't seem to keep Fulci on the right track . Now when it comes to pure fun and entertainment value Cat in the Brain certainly is one of Fulci's most pleasant films . The gore is overpowering and copious to say the least . The amount of filthy massacres is impossible to describe especially when you manage to get your hands on the fully uncut version to with the aka Concert'' Decapitations all around victims intestines are spread on all sides of the screen and the chainsaws are working overtime ! The film also becomes unintentionally funny quite soon it's so exaggerated and a perfect experience to watch with a group of friends when there's beer in the fridge . Of course from a more professional viewpoint this production ca n't exactly be called a masterpiece ! There's not the least bit of tension or atmosphere to detect and the characters are completely empty In order to make more room for the gore characters are just being introduced for seconds and subsequently die a horrible death . Especially compared with Fulci's highlights like The Beyond'' or Do n't Torture a Duckling'' this film looks like a quickly warmed up snack . The best way to interpret Cat in the Brain'' is like a personal statement made by Fulci and a direct attack towards censorship . Perhaps after seeing so many of his films especially the latter ones being cut by censorship committees and bashed by pseudo critics he wanted to avenge himself by delivering a gory mess that simply ca n't be cut ! If you take out all the explicit violence and the truly sick make effects you only got about minutes of footage left ! Especially because the insane killings re later in the film as Fulci hallucinates about them again . You can almost hear our director think stuff like Let's see how you're going to censor this now ! Even the entire development of the murder investigation happens in the background . Are the victims missed by any of their friends or relatives ? Are there any police officers looking for clues that'll lead them to the killer ? You do n't know and Lucio does n't bother to inform you about that because that would lead to sequences that do n't require cutting . Oh and it's pretty damn pretentious as well ! The name Mr. Fulci'' or even Lucio'' is mentioned every minutes times throughout the entire movie to be exact and our director clearly enjoys being in the spotlights for a change . Hey certainly do n't blame him . over years of delivering amusing movies he deserved to have a little extra fun . You're a God Mr. Fulci !
9584_7.txt,1, OK so admit that it often seems like most of the Sylvester pairings have exactly the same plot Sylvester tries to get Tweety but repeatedly fails and always gets maimed in the process often with the help of a bulldog . guess that it's sort of like Wile Coyote chasing Road Runner other words mammals should never go after birds All a Bir has the same plot and sets it on a train . In a way the best part of these cartoons is seeing what sorts of schemes Sylvester comes up with to try and go after Tweety . We know that he's going to fail miserably but it's also funny to watch Tweety turn into a bad you've seen his really early cartoons you'll see that he was not cute'' at all but in fact had a cruel streak This one mainly works as a way to pass time . By the way thought that saw mean taut taw Sylvester pass a piece of baggage with the name Friz Freleng on it .
3690_8.txt,1, But a great cast ! Jonathan Pryce Kathy Bates Rupert Everett Lynne Redgrave Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd ! And that's just the beginning . I'm not totally sure that any description of the movie and plot are going to entice you to watch this one . Suffice it to say that it has something for practically everyone death singing a sparkly suit cell phones a little person looking woman actually a drawbridge not Medieval a boombox and a crossbow . Oh and a psychotic . And Barry Manilow . You will have to trust me when say that of you out there will hate this movie because of the lack of the Absurd Gene in your DNA makeup . It's not your fault it's hereditary . The other of you will probably want to change the channel after minutes but you HAVE TO KEEP WATCHING . Even at that at the end you may wonder why you watched . but keep in mind that absurdity thing . It should grow on you . It is a test .
11206_9.txt,1, When you're watching Distant you know you're not watching a French movie there's little sex and it's mostly elliptical and people do n't talk that much here there are a few lines scattered here and there and a couple of important conversations just to let you make sense of what's going on . It does n't look American either there are n't any car chases or shoot or violence unless you consider the killing of a mouse an act of blood or the daily tension of getting by a subdued catastrophe . At times the relatively long medium shots may remind you of Asian cinema but just reminds you the director does n't push things to the radical minimalism of some Taiwanese filmmakers but then again this is not a Taiwanese movie it's a Turkish movie . do n't know what that means do n't even know if that's supposed to mean something . The movie does n't have a plot proper and yet those few lines those somewhat long shots and that often mitigated tension gradually build a sense of something happening a sense of for lack of a better word that grows on you . By the end of the movie you may get the feeling you're going to miss those two cousins who have many things in common but are worlds apart .
1393_8.txt,1, saw this movie on television as SCREAMERS and loved it . heard an interesting story about this film . When Roger Corman released it to drive in the summer of his trailer department sent out an advance trailer which was not actually footage from the film . It was allegedly footage of a naked woman being chased around a laboratory set by a monster . During the film's opening at drive irate customers complained the did not see the movie they paid to see . Theater owners called Corman and said their customers felt ripped off . So Corman had to run off copies of the footage and send the positive film to theater owners to splice into the film themselves . Since the footage was never part of the film negative it has not appeared in any video DVD or television broadcast . Has anyone ever seen this footage ? Anyone who saw this film at a drive in the summer of remember this ?
8446_10.txt,1, Author msgreen from Canada The big problem was the China Syndrome'' claim that if the reactor error occurred and radioactive waste leaked out it could burn its way straight through the earth to China . lot of people have made fun of this and if the movie makers meant it seriously then yes it should be made fun of . The spill would n't make it anywhere near the center of the earth or even the molten rock . Even if it did make it to the center of the Earth how would it come out in China ? It would have to flow against gravity the rest of the way ! Also China is not the opposite side of the world the Indian Ocean is . This point is brought up by the characters of the film saying that of course it could not happen as the core would hit ground water and release a radio cloud raining down on the population . Before you try to find a weak point in the film you should watch it first ! Do n't judge a book by it's title .
647_9.txt,1, Meant to be some sort of a social commentary about the way that our lives were spinning out of control in the this movie plays more like something Mr. Schlesinger threw together after having a bad day on the freeway . mish mash of snippets about the nuts encountered along the freeway in Florida and along the freeway of life the cast is mostly wasted and probably ended up on the cutting room floor . The problem is that what DID N'T end up on the cutting room floor probably should have ! Now available on DVD it's kinda fun to see a comedy that would have cost million to produce had it been made in It rolls along and is n't too difficult to sit through and strangely enough in we're all still pretty much just hopping in our cars and going faster and faster heading nowhere .
11836_7.txt,1, This is one of the better Marion Davies talkies and one of the few to allow her to exhibit her skill as a physical comedian which was so endearing in her silent films . OK so she does a clunky tap number but even Ruby Keeler's dancing from the era does not hold up for younger generations . The problem here is the script . The story falls into unbelievable melodrama in the last reel . It's quite stagey and is obviously adapted from a play . but not well enough . Still there is some snappy dialogue and slapstick throughout . Worth a look .
3895_7.txt,1, can not say this movie was a hilarious but must have had a grin on my face the entire time . like this darker kind of comedy very bad things'' heads in a duffel bag'' or coldblooded'' The way the main character tries to get away with murder is a lot of fun to watch . To me it was not much of a surprise what the ending would be but the way that ending came about was . Another thing that sticks out is the way they have managed to involve the audience . The way Terry looks at us is hilarious you can almost pretend you're his accomplice .
9692_9.txt,1, First off want to say most of the people who give this a poor review do n't like this kind of comedy the movie is great if you have an open mind and are n't afraid to laugh at some stupid things . This movie is shot just like the TV show with a lot of short clips compiled into one long movie . Some of the scenes do n't even have dialog someone will just come out and do something unexpected and it is funny ! The only negative had is felt like wasted money on my Popcorn and Icee there was no way could eat or drink anything during this movie was constantly laughing . was honestly nervous of drinking some Icee and seeing something that caused me to laugh and shoot it everywhere . If you do n't mind some male nudity and you enjoy Jackass the movie jackass the TV show and viva la bam then for YOUR SAKE go see this movie . And if you DO N'T like the first movie or the TV show . Do n't see it and if you do see it do n't post a bad review about it . Hardcore christians who see this and bash it just does n't seem right to me .
974_10.txt,1, could watch this movie ALL DAY ! LOVE it . Probably my all time favorite movies . But by the way badger there are a few parts with bad language not TOO bad but it's not exactly rated . GREAT movie ! recommend it to everybody . Any way it's making me type lines of text so am going to keep typing until it will let me post this comment . Okay . Still typing . This is getting annoying . Ugh . still have four more to go . Anyway WATCH THIS MOVIE ! Even if you have already seen it . DO N'T CARE ! Has it been lines yet ? Nope . Only more lines left . do n't even know why it wants me to do this . think am done . Wait a minute I'm NOT done SORRY people . know it's torture listening to me . WEll suppose that you do n't HAVE to read this comment . But you should because wrote it . am probably done now . Finally bye .
9374_7.txt,1, have n't read the source Richard Brooks novel The Brick Foxhole which hope is not as infelicitous as its title but understand the original villain was a homophobe not an anti Semite . to be honest Sam Levene is written as a gay guy who picks up a drunken soldier . But okay you have to go with the flow . Consider Not even anti has been treated on screen yet . Many of the people responsible for contemporary movies were themselves Jews but anti had been verboten for years because it was considered unpleasant . So we can hardly blame the makers of this film for not leaving the victim a homosexual . Now that's REALLY unpleasant and besides there might have been many among the audience rooting for Robert Ryan to get away with it . We are by no means free of prejudice but we've still come a long way since Watching this again for the first time in years was impressed with the rather slow pace of the first half of the movie the many shots of two people talking the shadows the time that passes between the question and the answer the uninspired editing . But could live with that because of the film's subject matter and because of a few other things . One of the things that keep me glued to events as they unfold so deliberately is Robert Ryan's performance . The guy does a splendid job . At times he can seem thoughtful cheerfully subordinate and helpful to the police Any way can help yes sir . Then alone or with another soldier the simmering hatred rises to the top not so much through what he says but the way he LOOKS . That scowl that penetrating stare those dark eyes glittering . Wow . The film has taken a lot of heat because of Robert Young's preachy speech about his Grandfather's murder . That does n't bother me at all although guess Dmytryk did n't have to have Young shove his face into the camera while talking about MICKS and PAPISTS'' Still taking the context into account it's one of the more shocking moments of the film . Part of its impact is due to Young's almost casual delivery of the message and part of it is due to the message's not having been heard on screen before . Another feature of the film that transforms it almost into the surreal is the Paul Kelly character and his relationship to the whore Gloria Grahame . Holy Guacamole what elliptical conversation Kelly is given to . You know what told you ? All those things just told you ? They're all lies . His character neatly crosses pathos with creepiness . It's impossible to know what to make of him . He adds virtually nothing to the plot but the movie would be a lot less without his presence . It's a moody murky film . Its people live in the dark . And there is murder afoot . Practically no one screams or shouts . The horror that these men have experienced and that some of them still carry with them like malaria seems just beneath the surface . See it if you have a chance .
2409_8.txt,1, I'm not sure how can make ten lines out of this question but I'll try . When Julie went to the dance and they were dancing to slow music . What was the name of the song that was playing and who played it ? love that song ! And watch the movie over and over just to hear that one song . did several searches online and even looked up the soundtrack but sill ca n't find the song . It might be because the song they were dancing to was n't a complete song and just partial . would appreciate if anyone out there who knows what the name of the song and the group who sung it . Thank you . Frank
6966_7.txt,1, Seeing that this movie was on the IMDB Bottom simply had to rent it . SUPRISE ! SUPRISE ! have no regret of seeing this movie at all . In fact really enjoyed it . There's a level of camp in this movie that puts cult classics of the to shame . Is it stupid ? yes but Jim Wynorski proves that stupid is not necessarily bad after all . Rent it for a laugh that seems unintended but is actually meant to be funny . Wynorski is a genius . Hope he directs the next ninja turtles movie
6125_7.txt,1, Babs Johnson lives in a trailer with her son Crackers her daughter Cotton and her mother Edie Massey She's in competition with a couple named Connie and Raymond Marbles Stole David Lochary to be named the filthiest person alive . The film shows their attempts to outdo each other . This film is very much NOT for everyone . It's a in your face no holds barred assault in bad taste . Crackers has sex with a woman with a live chicken between them while his sister watches the Marbles pick up female hitchhikers impregnate them keep them chained in the basement and sell the babies to lesbian couples Divine and family have a party which includes cannibalism etc etc . It's disgusting but in a way not unwatchable . It's SO over the top and is so unapologetic about it that it's kind of fascinating . As director John Waters might say it's bad taste done well . Also it's kind of amusing to watch acting is so wretched by Massey that you just watch it in disbelief . friend laughed out loud at how bad Massey was improved in later pictures This is NOT for people who are easily offended . Even though it's over years old it's STILL shocking . However if you have an open mind and can take a lot of extreme behaviour this is a must The only part that really was too much is what Divine does at the very end .
12330_8.txt,1, ca n't describe the feeling when got this crappy VHS rental cassette in my hands about years ago . Somehow got my father to rent it for me and watched it twice with my little brother . Yes we got nightmares . This film was originally rated as PG in the US in many other countries including Finland it was restricted under or The film was aimed to teenagers but this must be the goriest PG film ever . There's no bad language or nudity in it what so ever . Originally made in stayed on the shelves for a couple of years before release . This is an a true well made horror flick . bunch of college girls decide to spent a night in a mausoleum not knowing that a supernatural evil awaits . You can almost smell the rotting flesh and feel the atmosphere of this movie . It's campy utterly stupid but they just ca n't make these movies anymore . There is definitely a certain feel to this horror genre . This one is still effectively spooky and entertaining after all these years . The effects are just oozing quality by Ellis Burman Jr and Thomas Burman . The make effects play a big part in this flick otherwise it would've been just a boring teen slasher . It's now available on DVD at last and it's a Special Edition DVD including some extras too . Commentary track is interesting . fact this version is n't so special after all . Below average transfer on DVD some glitches and scratches here and there At first it was going to be released by the Blue Underground but unfortunately it was canceled so Shriek Show released it without restoring the print . Too bad ! Great date Recommended ! Note ! only gave out of because of the nostalgic values'' otherwise out of
6750_10.txt,1, think this movie was made as good as it could have been . With only months and a budget I'm surprised this was n't worse . If you are not to care about the CG or special effects this movie is great . Okay the movie is not that well made sure it could have been but you try to do better in only months but the story is good and the movie is rather exciting . DO n't trust me when say that this movie is good cause also find the King Kong to be good . must confess that did n't watch the complete movie either . might have fast forwarded some minutes here and there .
11289_10.txt,1, Elias Merhige's existentialist experiment in the enduring is definitely one hell of a boring watch . This is like something Alexander de Large was forced to watch in Clockwork Orange . But despite just how unwatchable this film really is it is a success . If you are reading this and have not already seen the film then it is too late . For me at least the payoff separate viewings with lots of break in between mind you was seeing the list of characters the story was told . That's when the simple message hit home . But wonder if Merhige could have told a minutes story in about instead of However seeing as how the cast of credits is displayed prominently on the front page for this movie the cat is already out of the bag and you surely will only appreciate this film if you appreciate existentialist film making from the early century . Even then you might puke . commend Merhige for crafted a piece of art even if it is unwatchable
8205_10.txt,1, This Movie is a warning to all people sat surfing the internet on a typical day at the office . My Warning is not reveal too much about yourself Be careful who you cross ! are spies on this internet thing . thought that it was so scary what that man and woman combination did to poor Angela Bennett did not realise that somebody could take ones life away in one click of this mouse Angela thought did a sterling job of outwitting Jack Delvin and that awful girl my question is why does that computer make that noise when it works ? like a clicking sound mine does not do this or this one . This film also tells you that there is fraud on this internet Also why could n't Angela do the virus destroyer programme at a CyberCafe ? also thought that like all computers the transfer rate to disk was slow that is correctly portrayed in this film when you save the programme to your floppy disk the bar only moved slowly ! quite liked Angela's house at the beginning of the film as well Why did no one believe Angela ?
9732_10.txt,1, This is the kind of movie that you rent when you are incredibly tired or impaired in some other way . The acting in this movie is so bad it seems intentional and to let you know how bad the special effects are there is one scene when the puppets are coming alive where you can see most of a hand holding the puppet moving it about . The movie looked as if it was filmed with a camcorder . When saw this movie for the first time a fistfight nearly erupted when my friends and were calling each other names from this flick that's how terrible it was . If you enjoy getting mad at movies recommend this to you otherwise flee as though your very life depended on it .
10062_9.txt,1, For late cheese this really is n't so bad . There are a lot of pretty funny throwaway one was grand theft ! Thanks ! and Madonna gives a fine performance nothing award here but that goes for Razzies as well as Oscars . I'm curious to know if the movie would have been better received if she had used her regular influenced speaking voice rather than the hyper accent used instead . Oh well . As a side note got to meet one of the actors who played one of the motorcycle cops through my work he said that it was a fun film to work on but gave me the sad news that the actor who played Buck the UPS delivery guy died about a year after Who's That Girl
2300_9.txt,1, this particular title is very interesting . the whole movie was like watching a ninja RPG which is really cool . three magical swords three clans a horrible demon a political power yotoden has it all . the animation is decent but a little grainy the story is top notch and the fight scenes are real cool . one thing that really looks good in this movie are the monsters . they are pretty freaky . if you liked blood reign and ninja scroll yotoden is the one to see .
3237_7.txt,1, I've just watched this again on the BBC Channel It's not Jane Austen's best novel by any means but the film is a reasonable interpretation . suspect the Assembly Rooms at Bath would have been rather more crowded than shown perhaps they could n't afford the extras . Also why does everyone shut up so that the dancing couple can have an audible conversation ? I've never heard anything anyone has ever said to me when I've been dancing and suspect it would have been the same in the century in Bath . can not believe the US reviews they completely miss the ironic element that is in the film throughout . The gothic'' scenes are quite cleverly presented but you need to read them properly . I'm sure Jane would be mildly amused by those reviews . propos of nothing does anyone else think that Peter Firth gets to look more like Colin Baker former Doctor Who or vice the older they both get ?
2237_7.txt,1, caught this movie late night on TV and was expecting a low campy masterpiece'' was surprised with a pretty decent movie . Angelina Jolie's unique acting capabilities should say lack thereof ? make her perfect as an android and the other actors while terribly average are at least not terrible . There is a plot a fairly intricate plot at that involving conspiracies and the lengths a couple human one android will go to pursue their illegal romance with a big brother'' figure and android assassin thrown in the mix . The production and sets also were much better than expected . have n't seen the original Cyborg so ca n't really compare it to much else granted this film is no Blade Runner but as a late futuristic guilty pleasure its worth a watch .
12342_7.txt,1, This is an OK early horror flick in which a young girl Tilly is wanting to shed her goody two shoes'' image and becomes part of a girl gang called The Sisters . Their initiation for her consists of spending the night in a mausoleum . Too bad the mausoleum is the final'' resting place of some psycho Russian psychic and he's not quite dead yet . Seems this guy was found in his apartment with lots of things stuck into the walls from his telekinetic target practice plus there is a pile of young dead girls found in the closet . All proof that hitch hiking can be dangerous so listen up girls . The daughter of this man is rather distraught about her father's death and is confronted by a man that said he knew Reymar and given a tape to listen too . Her hubby West of Batman fame is there to laugh and scoff and not much else . But it seems that perhaps Reymar's daughter may also have some abilities that she does n't realize . Anyway having deposited their unfortunate pledge at the mausoleum the rest of The Sisters take off to go get stuff masks sheets etc to come back and scare the crap out of her but little do they suspect what's going on and they get more than the crap scared out of them . For even in death Reymar is kind of a busy guy and he's reanimating lots of corpses for entertainment . And it would also seem that he has a thing for jail bait . Overall this is acceptable horror nothing too intense but not terrible either . The DVD from Media Blasters also contains another version of the movie that's a rough cut guess only watched a little of it so do n't know how different it is from the theatrical release but from what saw guess it's a warts and all'' presentation . out of
7689_7.txt,1, had the privilege recently of viewing what is said to be the last Technicolor stereo print and found it much livelier and more touching than remembered . Also closer to the original material basically all screenwriter Richard Nash did was trim change much recitative to spoken dialog and insert a transitional scene or two a very amusing one for Pearl Bailey Oliver Smith's production design is stagy in the Li' l Abner'' and Dolls'' adaptation mode but it works well for this work's folkloric unrealistic quality . Stereotyping and racism are present but not to a wince degree . Further for a movie of its time it's pretty frank the adultery violent behavior drug use and self habits of the denizens of Catfish Row are not at all minimized in the telling . But there are debits beginning with all that variation from the stage text . The loss of so much compromises Gershwin's brilliance no wonder the family does n't like it . The reorchestration especially of Sammy Davis Jr. material is disconcertingly trendy and vulgar . George knew what he was doing folks you did n't have to mess with it so much . And while Poitier and Dandridge act well and their singing doubles sing well there's a huge chasm between the characters singing and speaking voices you're constantly aware of the artifice . What really counts here of course is the music among the greatest ever written for the theater anywhere . Despite all the tinkering it survives you'd have to be made of stone not to be moved by it . If the treatment is n't entirely to the estate's liking it should n't be there's still no reason not to spend some bucks to restore this ambitious filming of Gershwin's masterpiece and make new generations more aware of his genius .
9007_8.txt,1, The new voices scare me ! Kuzco does n't have to pass some frickkin academy to become emperor again ! It's the same thing over and over is n't it ? This IS a kids show right ? Yzma turns Kuzco into something stupid like an animal . He learns a lesson . EVERYTHING IS THE SAME ! David Spade and John Goodman never returned . Nothing changes Disney wo n't do anything it . It's probably one of the most retarded shows ever ! The first movie was so damn better ! Malina's probably the only person like . Kuzco's such a crybaby ! Kronk is retarded ! And Yzma's retarded that's even a word What meant to say is . How could you Disney . why ?
6256_8.txt,1, Okay this was n't the greatest horror movie I've ever seen in my life . Despite the fact that it's lower budget it's a pretty decent movie though . The monsters are unique and believable . Heck they're even kind of scary in the scenes where they show them briefly wreaking havoc on this poor family . Although when you finally do get to see the monsters completely you really think WTF ! those itty bitty things are after them ? The only part that really disturbed me is when they killed the kitty ! Not the kitty noooooo why ? Seriously though if you are looking for hardcore violence and gore this is not the movie for you . Go rent The Hills Have Eyes or something along those lines . If you have small children would n't recommend watching this with them though probably would give them nightmares about trolls in their room .

4990_7.txt,1, Comanche Moon'' had everything going for it . For starters Simon Wincer's back a man who's name is synonymous with high TV westerns . Unfortunately the problems with Moon'' are something even the most talented director could n't solve poor script based on a lackluster novel . Forget historical accuracies as any reader of the novels can tell you the biggest travesty in Moon'' is that it's not even consistent with information from the original Lonesome Dove'' masterpiece . So many wonderful rich moments in the miniseries and to an even greater degree the book are completely missing in Moon . Considering the fact that most viewers of Moon'' are probably coming with at least some sort of Dove'' background the lack of character and emotional backstory is downright painful . That said Moon'' is one instance where the adapted version could and should have been altered to make it more suitable for the screen . For example the novel Moon'' focuses largely on the Comanches themselves . To its credit the miniseries tries to service the Comanches but in the end it gives them just enough that the viewer just gets a sense they're missing out on some important part of the story . Similarly Val Kilmer's Scull loses out here too the role should have either been expanded so Kilmer Rachel Griffiths for that matter actually had something to do or the roles should have just been reduced to smaller supporting parts . Instead Kilmer gets top billing for a character that just leaves you scratching your head after his appearance in the completely bizarre final act . There's strange moments throughout the film that just make no sense to those who have n't read the book killer parrot ? what ? further there is n't a single scene that shows us that Call and McCrae are anything near the amazing Texas rangers they claim to be . Not a single one of their expeditions in Moon Dead Man's Walk for that matter ends successfully and Call and McCrae just seem to blunder their way through one pointless mission after another . Frankly Larry McMurtry should never have been given the job of writing the script and only did so because of the praise surrounding that other cowboy movie Brokeback Mountain . McMurtry can write good novels there's some dissension over the consistency of that statement but he's never exactly established himself as a scriptwriter . This production would have benefited from not only bringing back director Wincer but original screenwriter Bill Wittcliff to adapt the novel to screen . Witcliff does n't exactly have a mountainload of material to his screen writing credit but no one can deny he did a fantastic job at whittling down the original Lonesome Dove . With all this said Comanche Moon'' is almost a brilliant production aided by a terrific cast that unfortunately just are n't given enough to do . Steve Zahn's portrayal of Gus McCrae or rather his portrayal of Robert Duvall as Gus McCrae is dead And while some have criticized Karl Urban as Woodrow Call saying his performance does n't imitate the quiet stoic Woodrow of the original movie all can say is blame McMurtry because McMurtry is the one who both in the Moon'' novel and now the miniseries turned Woodrow from socially inept awkward but natural leader into some emotionless character whose lines are just dull and whose character motivations are only clear if you've seen them portrayed far more adequately in the sequel'' Still it's the cast that sparkles in Moon to the degree that left the miniseries with that same feeling of melancholy felt watching the original Lonesome Dove'' this time because realized it's probably the last time we'll see these characters appear on screen for a long long time to come and quite honestly this cast could have done so well in a well full network TV series . All in all aside from wasted opportunities with the cast the biggest travesty is that the original Lonesome Dove novel contained so much rich backstory for the characters that would have been fascinating utterly fascinating to see translated on screen . Unfortunately all that has been tossed aside in favor of McMurtry's tedious inconsistent and ultimately irrelevant prequel .
3814_7.txt,1, saw this before ho at the fantasia film festival in montreal . everything about it is either tipping the hat to completely ripping off tim burton . enjoyed it nonetheless even if it is extremely derivative . what most impressed me was the quality of the visuals given the obvious shoe budget . the set design and the props were inventive and original although the script definitely was not .
3568_8.txt,1, When die someone will bury me . And if they do n't what's the difference . Who gives a damn huh ? Thus the philosophy of life lack there of is summed up once and for all in this less than classic but nevertheless fun spinoff of Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy . In the opening scene three obviously evil gunmen ride into a western town and with menacing glares they intimidate all the pathetic normal people hiding in their homes . The observant watcher will notice that each of these three bears a striking resemblance to characters from Leone's For Few Dollars More . There is one guy in Eastwood's poncho one in Lee Van Cleef's black suit and one seeming to act like Gian Marie Volonte's Indio . But this movie is not about these guys . No sooner do they ride into town when they are gunned down by someone even cooler than they a mysterious bounty hunter known simply as the Stranger . No . this is an altogether different story . In an obvious copying of Leone's The Good the Bad and the Ugly three gunmen are again vying for a hidden treasure . Once again there is the bounty hunter and the Mexican bandit . The Stranger Hilton is a supercool bounty hunter with a penchant for shooting people while dressed up like a priest . He is after the reward for the bandit Monetero Roland But when Monetero's gang steals three hundred thousand in gold coins the Stranger gets sidetracked from his normal line of work . To round off the trio there is Edd Byrne's corrupt bank executive Clayton . He too wants the money for himself . But after the money is hidden away the only man who knows where it is gets shot . Now the only clue to the hiding place is a medallion that shows a family crest . The game is too find the treasure before anyone else does . And any gun can play . With plenty of gunfights fist fights and double crosses the action takes these three to the ultimate showdown ripoff a three way draw for the hidden treasure ala The Good the Bad and the Ugly but with a twist . This movie is not as good as Leone's films of course but in the end who gives a damn huh ? This movie is fun nihilism spaghetti western style . There are no rules no enduring loyalties and no right or wrong just the treasure and whatever it takes to get it . And though the movie is not classic the ending surely is . Hey maybe we all can get along after all for a hundred thousand a piece . If you like spaghetti westerns check this one out . It is fast furious and worth the look .
3622_7.txt,1, Spike Milligan's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years and is sadly no exception . The novel set in concerns the partitioning of Ireland in particular its effects on a solitary community the of the title Due to a colossal blunder half the village is now in Northern Ireland the other half is in the Republic . Locals go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence blocking their path . Drinkers crowd like sardines into a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint . dead man has to have a passport made out in his name before villagers can reach the churchyard to bury him . is a sort of Irish Milk Wood with comic characters and surreal happenings galore . The lead character Dan Milligan renamed in the film is impishly played by Sean Hughes and has conversations with the narrator Richard Attenborough Also in the film is Milo O'Shea Griff Rhys Jones David Kelly from Nest Freddie Jones Joe McGann and Elliott Gould . Interviewed for the of documentary writer Terence Ryan expressed undying admiration for the book . It shows on screen . But alas like the ill film of Hitch Guide To The Galaxy a good book does not necessarily make a good film . The trouble with is that like Milligan's other books they simply do not work on the big screen . is essentially a collection of jokes in search of a plot . No way can the film be compared to train wrecks like Lives Of The Potato Men Slags and Vampire Killers but then neither is it as good as it should have been . The last half involves a lot of running around by the police the British army some locals who have stashed explosives in a coffin and is really tedious to sit through . Ryan's decision to stick closely to the book is the main reason for its failure to work as a film . The other problem is the total absence of charm . Ned had this in spades while the Ted television series was funnier by far . Spike lived long enough to see the film and apparently enjoyed it . His daughter Jane has a cameo as Madigan's bride . The highlight for me though was the quotation at the beginning do n't mind dying ! said Spike just do n't want to be there when it happens !
3374_10.txt,1, I'd honestly give this movie a solid but clicked to try to offset the pages of imbecilic unjustified reviews . This is an interesting story all of the acting is good to very good Ms. Diaz who is totally out of her usual grinning role here yet plays it well . The sets are perfect and the cinematography is consistently appropriately creepy . It's a fine morality play and there is reason to explain the origin of the god being that's running the show so I'm glad the movie does n't try . It's really irrelevant to the story which is relatively long but quite compelling and summed up quite satisfyingly in the ending . Before you decide this movie is terrible really anything under a read some of the dozens of hated it'' reviews that are rife with misspellings lack of punctuation and capitalization and juvenile criticisms . Maybe the trailer was misleading or something did n't see it but some of these reviewers were apparently expecting Terminator or Saw reviewer actually compared this movie to Saw ! How utterly inappropriate and unrelated ! Seriously most of these reviews read like you comments according to these critics'' this movie is too confusing yet too predictable not enough action yet there's too much going on too smart yet too dumb explains too much yet leaves too much unexplained . oh and it's apparently a waist of time . Do consider the quality and source of the reviews before taking them to heart . I'm afraid these kids failed to understand the phrase altruism coefficient'' and were therefore utterly incapable of understanding the movie's premise adamantly claiming that they get it'' right before explaining how confusing it was ! If you know what those two words mean you will have no trouble understanding enjoying this movie . really wish there were a reviewer reputation system here so could be sure to ignore the rating of everyone who gave this movie star forever . See it for yourself and enjoy the fine presentation of an interesting couple taking an interesting moral test'' and facing the consequences . It's a good time in my opinion .
6272_9.txt,1, This film must have been quietly released on some other side of the world perhaps even in English . Hopefully nobody understood a word not there's anything to understand in this movie anyways ! Haahaa ! Call me a nut but think this is one of the best movies ever . Why would come to that conclusion ? Because it's my national pasttime to sabotage horrible films and this one begs for it every other minute ! Once became a fan of Myster Science Theater had no doubt in my mind they'd find it somewhere and use it . Sure enough ! The version they acquired was entitled Cave Dwellers'' using some strange intro footage not even from the film itself they were ashamed to use footage from their OWN film ! ca n't say recommend buying this film . Rather highly recommend getting the MST version . Sure to find it most anywhere MST DVD's are sold do n't miss out !

3942_8.txt,1, This film was adapted from the well known sutra on Journey to the West where a monk with his three students seek out to find a long lost book with regards to the teaching of Buddha . Though this movie is not as solemn as the previous films made according to the legend it did however managed to bring in romance and fun humorous scene . This real objective of this movie revolves around more on the monk who were primarily saved from being eaten by demonic flying creatures . One of his student the Monkey God managed to get him out from the battle in the nick of time but were in turn captured by the demons and cast into the deep throat of a dragon locked up in that particular dungeon . The monk awoke in a small village where he found Mei Yan so called ugly serpent daughter who fell in love over him at first sight . Though ugly she did not let her appearance be casted aside from getting to him . However a quest for rescuing his three students soon turn out to be filled with obstacles and each of which turned out to get worse with Mei Yan following the monk . Problems crept deeper and this is where conflicts between the relationship gets worse . The rest of the tale would be left at your own disposal but suffice to say this film does not depict the typical storyline of the book it is more for those who wants to seek out for a funny and light picture of what Journey to the West and the love obstacles really mean . Towards the very end the whole summary could be described with only one word and that is love . The monk went to show the Heavenly Gates the Celestial Palace and Buddha himself how love can overcome even the worst fear of all and deemed fit as the most powerful weapon that can be used against any enemy of superior powers . wonderfully created and funny acts awaits those who buys this ticket . There would be of course no regrets at least from my side and those who were with me at the cinema that day watching the same film .
3285_8.txt,1, This was a pretty good episode . Though no Trapped in the Closet'' or Cartoon Wars it had a lot of things going for it . The character of Al Gore and that bizarre super cereal'' thing was pretty darn funny . But the scene that made me adore this episode was one I'm sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest Cartman moments ever . When Cartman is superstitious of Kyle that he'll be stealing his gold of course is fake ! and he comes within inches of his face . Suddenly Kyle wakes up and they have that crazy conversation where Cartman tries to act like everything is completely fine . Cartman crapping out the treasure at the end though predictable was pretty funny .
7834_8.txt,1, Forget everything that you have ever read about the Mallachi Brothers straight release Snakes on a Train especially if it was a negative review . This movie is way more fun than the movie that it obviously rips off Snakes on a Plane . Frankly am surprised that more people are n't rhapsodizing about this low Asylum Release . Instead most reviews that I've read have nothing kind or critically worthwhile to say except the usual stupid herd mentality idiocy such as the acting was amateurish the action did n't numerically live up to the advertising and the entire thing amounted to a hideous waste of time . Of course it does n't help that the title is a tip to the obvious rip nature of this film . Actually felt that Snakes on a Train'' surpassed Snakes on a Plane'' for a number of reasons . First the producers used real genuine snakes until the last fifteen minutes when they substituted either giant fake snake heads or computer generated a super snake that consumed an entire Amtrak like train . How many movies have a snake gobble a train ? As a result Snakes on a Train'' ranks as the first movie to scale that height . Second this low movie employs some grisly gross effects . The woman who coughs up baby snakes ones fantastic ! The special effects of her forearms getting tore up later in the movie were visually enticing ! Also you get to see a little white girl get eaten alive by a snake . She was as cute as she could be no more than years old or thereabouts and she died screaming all the way as nasty ol giant mister snake head swallows her . Not only kids in jeopardy but kid eaten ! This is exactly the kind of graphic material that you wo n't find in of all theatrical Hollywood releases . Of course she was n't eaten by a real snake but it's the subversive thought that counts . Third it is one of those cursed upon movies where Alma Ruiz of That Guy'' the chief female character heroine a curse placed on her by her parents because she did n't marry the man that they recommended . As a result she is filled with snakes coughs up quantities of green radiator fluid slop then chucks up a baby snake . Imagine Medusa the mythical characters that had snakes for hair only with the snakes in her belly . Her psycho type boyfriend collects all the snakes that come out of her because they are heading to on a train to see a relative of his who can put all the snakes back inside of her and return her to normal . Talk about a whacked out character performing stomach churning routines . Prepare yourself for lots of slime blood and gore . Fourth the train had only about twenty or so passengers not hundreds . Nevertheless it looked like the Mallachi Brothers filmed this above horror flick on a real train with real snakes and they played up the swaying motion of the train on the tracks . Fifth the snakes slither around for the first hour quietly infiltrating the train before they turn weird and attack everybody . In other words it's suspense suspense suspense before people start dying from snake bites . Up until the last five minutes when the snake grows bigger than the runaway train and swallows it Snakes on a Train'' is warped wonderful and way It does n't have the Attention Deficit editing of a big league Hollywood movie . It's a fantasy about an unfortunate Hispanic women victimized because of her feminist at attitude . Altogether you've got gory fantasy type stuff suspenseful snakes slithering around the train and am over gigantic snake at the end . Incidentally they get on board the train because a bunch of other Mexicans have bribed a train employee and the Mexicans on board think that the girl is so cute that they let her and her boyfriend on free . think it's better than Snakes on a Plane'' if you want a tough little independently produced horror movie .

It was so clearly about teens in the early and called my mom hahaha turn to channel such and such the kid totally looks like if dad were a kid'' Um . Yeah . Turns out this movie is about my dad his friends . Even without it being about loosely based on my dad's childhood i'd say watch this movie ! It is just . to say the least the apathy instilled in teens even back then . This is a good human interest'' and showcases some strange sides of the psyche .
6882_7.txt,1, So the Koreans are now knocking off American horror flicks . But they are doing so with style . DOLL MASTER is a close copy of PUPPETMASTER and DOLLS and even has a little CHILD'S PLAY going for it . Several young adults are invited to attend a special event at a gallery filled with dolls only to find they are targets of a vengeful spirit . The dolls come to life and do some pretty nasty things to the kids . The gore level is reasonably high the photography and set design and production values are first rate the acting is n't all that bad and the scares are definitely there . DOLL MASTER may not be in the same league with TALE OF TWO SISTERS or even DEAD FRIEND but it's close . Give it a watch . You wo n't be disappointed .

Lord Rudy Ray Moore and D'Urville Martin really put this one together did n't they ? laughed a lot as often happens in these types of movies but do n't know what was supposed to laugh at because laughed at so many other things . am not saying the movie was bad but will say that a little more editing would have done wonders . am a huge fan of Blaxploitation so do n't think that it was horrid but know that The Human Tornado'' was several times better than this . think that those who can make it through this movie might need a Colt or two afterward . mean it really helps you to not notice the boom mikes when you watch it again .

And to be as rapid and as random and as creative as Robin Williams really is . There were scenes where Diamantopoulos had to say probably rapid fire lines and do different characters while delivering those lines all while sounds as much like ROBIN WILLIAMS doing those characters . that my friends is impressive acting . Its one thing to do a Robin Williams impersonation for a couple of minutes . Its another to do it for a whole TV movie . do n't know how felt about the whole show and do n't know how much they played with the facts but do know that it was Chris Diamantopoulos that kept me watching .

10540_10.txt,1, review contains a huge spoiler but do n't know how to explain how cool it is without giving it away saw pinoccio's Revenge'' a while ago . Now you might think it's just a rip of Child's play . Indeed there are similarities . However Chucky was a possessed doll who works independently of the kid . It is POSSIBLE that Pinoccio is possessed with a demon or cursed or something . however the puppet itself is actually completely inanimate . The KID is insane and THE KID is the one killing people ! Everyone including the audience the survivors and the Kid herself thinks it's the doll . But it's the KID . The nudity is almost a pity because otherwise could tell everyone to see it because it really is an interesting horror movie .
6927_7.txt,1, ham actor without a penny . Who better than Michael Caine to play such a character ? He is totally and utterly hilarious but as in most of Caine's performances he goes for it for real . The film seems to be a showcase of Dylan Moran and he's splendiferous in his double act with Caine . This however is where the script falters . Moran's impersonations should have been incorporated in a rather more organic way . They are too much of an act on their own and makes the potential plausibility of the plot fly out of the window . Never mind . Get it if you can find it . There is enough in it to make it a pleasurable journey .
7647_8.txt,1, This one surprised me . read a few reviews beforehand that called it a good movie and was prepared for the worst . Halfway through it suddenly realised was completely wrapped up in it and enjoying it a lot . There were some really tense moments that had you sitting forward fiddling nervously with the remote control or any other object in reach . Overall this movie definitely does n't deserve the tag . Credit must be given to Director Gary Ellis and writers Bill Boatman Todd King for their movie debut . hope these guys continue with bigger budgets and some studio backing .

Soon there are men after her and a small private detective Jackson This was action with some great special effects and really funny one from Jackson Although the action may get a little silly at times who cares ? After all are n't movies meant to be a good time ? Craig Bierko is fun as a ruthless villain . The movie itself was an all good time . Just do n't expect to have to think too much about it because then if you take it too seriously then the movie actually wo n't be fun but stupid instead . This movie does n't deserve to be called stupid or any other bad name .

She might have had doubt in her actual role . But eventually she does the role only a nun could do who has nothing but faith in Christ . In America there are so many movies that describe condemned criminals or jails . Those scenes especially execution are too much different from Japan .
4337_10.txt,1, Death Wish is exactly what a bad movie should be . Terrible acting ! Implausible scenerios ! Ridiculous death scenes ! Creepy evil villains ! The last minutes of this movie just might be the best minutes ever put on film especially in the scene where the decent hardworking citizens string chains across the street knocking down the evil bikers and then shoot them only to be joined by the neighborhood children in celebration . And how can forget the elderly woman with the broom ? She's sweeping out the scum ! And if that's not enough let's not forget how quickly the punks give up after Fraker is killed . I'm laughing just thinking about it . also love the death scene of Kersey's girlfriend . He just away after seeing her get blown up . It's little things like this that make Death Wish such a bad movie . And I'm not even mentioning the bizarre soundtrack . watched this movie because of Martin Balsam who seriously think is one of the finest character actors ever who's own getting beaten up by the scum'' scene is hilarious and walked away with a new favorite movie . Thank you Death Wish for making me laugh so hard . Some other things forgot to mention The weird sound effect after Kersey says Cash ! when buying his used car . Ha ! It's so evil sounding . MANDY Fraker . Mandy ! Did the writers run out of tough guy names ? The fact that the gangs apparently have a lend and lease'' thug exchange program need some more guys . And that Mandy has a working phone line in an abandoned building . At the end of the movie after Kersey blows up Fraker is it just me or does it look like the street gang is about to break into choreography as they're giving up ? Just watch how in sync they are after the female punk gives the stop'' signal . love this movie . Nothing cheers me up like Death Wish
7628_7.txt,1, Stupidly beautiful . This movie epitomizes the bad it's good genre of films . The only two talents in it are Richard Boone and Joan van Ark and only Boone is any good . It's kind of sad that the man who rose to fame as Paladin should wind up in this ugly pile of celluloid . While he turns in a fantastic performance could n't help but feel that he so outclassed all his fellow actors in this piece that he should n't even have been there . The effects in this film are laughable but fun . The idea of a dinosaur being buried in the wall of a cave and suddenly coming to life is gold . When the gets killed watch how it falls . It's clear that the stunt performer in the FRONT of the costume knows the timing best . He falls to the ground well before the back half of the dinosaur follows suit . Speaking of there is nothing good to say about the purple tyrannosaur in this flick . It seems to have some kind of stealth technology since Bunta to be the best tracker in the world twice fails to notice it until it's within biting range of him . do n't know how all the prints are but in the version own the Tyranno's roar contains Godzilla's trademark bellow . This is loads of fun to watch if you like bad movies . love them and especially bad monster movies so consider this the gem of my collection . If bad movies are your thing definitely get this one .
3341_8.txt,1, This movie was released originally as a soft apparently with the explicit sex deleted . Later the producers relented'' money and re it with the excised scenes restored only about minutes guess since Kristine was of age it was held against her and her promising career came grinding to a halt . guess its all in the timing Pam Anderson's career Ronald Reagan was in charge during Kristine's debacle had not heard about Nancy Reagan's affairs Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinski were in full swing during Pam's coming out'' The sex is just icing on the cake both version satisfy . This naughty musical is way above similar of others that were released at the same time .
4301_9.txt,1, This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that have seen However am only in the second season . The typical Columbo activities are both amusing and irritating . His cigar ashes causing him trouble have been seen before And the bit where he always identifies in some way with the murderer this case cooking the scene on the TV cooking show distracted from the main theme . Also not explained was why the brother at the beginning of the show was cutting part of the wires of the mixer . The reason was never explained did it serve any purpose . But the part disliked the most was the death of the bride to be This was never explained and it is the main reason why give this episode such a low grade .
9068_7.txt,1, The story in this movie is fairly implausible grade stuff but the script called for a creepy guy to play the lead and in that meant Peter Lorre . And Peter is at his creepiest in this one as island owner Stephen Danel who gets prisoners paroled to his custody to work at his island diamond mine . Upon arrival the parolees discover that they are slave mine workers that can be beaten or killed at the whim of Danel . Only two things seem to have it worse off than the slaves Danel's wife and monkeys . Monkeys tick him off so much that his violence towards them probably leads to the only meat the slaves get . Lorre is perfect in his role here and creeps up the screen in industrial fashion . Although the script is not Casablanca caliber the editing is very tight and there are no wasted scenes . This is a very watchable story but I'm not sure what niche this movie filled . Too long for a short subject and too short for a feature length film I'm not sure how this was marketed to theaters . just caught this for the first time on a late night morning TCM showing . Lorre fans will not want to miss this one if they have n't seen it .
8544_10.txt,1, the hour was a movie just chanced upon . in late at night this movie kept my fascination throughout the entire film . quin is this poor unsuspecting guy who just wanted to fall in love with a woman by simple jealousy goes on this incredible journey movie a hidden treasure .
10354_7.txt,1, felt compelled to comment on this film because it's listed as the fourth lowest sci of all time on the IMDb . WHAT ! Sure this movie is crappy but it's HILARIOUS ! It's not awful on an Ed Wood level it's more surreal and uneven . There are some classic moments in the film . The brain surgery is gross and great and even nuttier when you consider that the film was rated PG ! Gor chasing after his dolly before getting battery acid dumped on his face Mine ! Gimmee ! Zandor Vorkoff's speeches at the beginning of the film Before Amir Kali was but another weak nation struggling to break free from centuries of stagnant feudalism ! Angelo Rossito also has some great lines No Gor ! No ! You want these keys do n't you my pretties ? It is absolutely wrong that this is the lowest sci on the IMDb because it is ENTERTAINING . No matter how bad a film is if it still manages to be weird quirky unsettling or entertaining it has merit and does n't deserve to be dumped on and dismissed . wo n't defend most of Al Adamson's films but this one along with Dracula VS. FRANKENSTEIN and BLOOD OF GHASTLY HORROR are entertaining enough to make up for their awfulness .
2616_10.txt,1, this episode is not incoherent like another person said . the source agreed to help because he was not going to keep his word if you pay attention . he says after she agrees to stay down there in hell GET RID OF HER AND BALTHAZOR SO DO N'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEM IN THE FUTURE'' and also he did n't let COLE WARN THE SISTERS LIKE PHOEBE ASKED IN EXCHANGE OF ACCEPTING THE DEAL that's why PRUE DIED because she got hit harder than PIPER and on the head and there was no PHOEBE to call for LEO this time and in the past LEO SAID THAT SHE ALMOST GOT HERSELF KILLED . pay more attention next time ! and there is not a TO BE CONTINUED . after this episode . it is the ending of season and on season they ca n't show anything from PRUE because she owns the rights of it PRUE'' so the producers would have to pay her for whatever they show . this is the last episode she is in !
5864_10.txt,1, remember this film as the other person that commented said . recorded over it but wish had it now just because it had to be one of the worst movies ever . Funny in a real bad way . remember the tag line on the box was The ultimate frontal lobotomy'' got it from my mom who got it from a friend at work who said it was the worst cheesiest movie she had ever seen so my mom said My son will probably love it . and the woman gave it to her just to get it out of her possession . then later taped over it which regret . also remember the corck screw'' thing was one of those ball catcher things . the yellow cone shaped things with a red button'' at the end and when you hit the red thing it sends a ball flying . Well they used that with a crank on one end and a corkscrew in the funnel . When the killer killed they would show him coming forward with the weapon'' and then cut to a close up of what appeared to be raw chicken and fake blood on the victims head . do n't know what else to say about this gem'' except that if you like bad films it does n't get any worse than this .
4192_10.txt,1, Forget Easy Rider Head is THE film about the Almost laugh as the Monkees reduce their entire career to a one TV commercial about dandruff ! See the foot Victor Mature try to figure out what the heck he's doing in this film ! Hear Frank Zappa his pet cow on leash tell Davey Jones Your music is awfully white'' Experience the Monkees only live performance as a real rock band play the honest first real punk song Sky Listen as Davey Jones sings a Harry Nielsen song about having a transsexual father ! Be confused be very confused as confused as Terri Garr is when Mickey Dolenz makes sexual innuendos about her in her film debut ! Witness futile protests against the Vietnam War leap out of nowhere and just as quickly disappear ! Watch Mike Nesmith spit on Christmas while wearing a velvet Victorian smoking jacket in a cobwebbed Gothic horror sound Let yourself drift into the karmic bliss inspired by a comic version of Indian mysticism delivered by a hammy white character in black while Peter Tork pretends that he knows how to play a guitar ! Discover Academy Award winning director Bob Rafelson's first feature length film as written by Academy Award winning actor Jack Nicholson ! Pretend it's not happening when the Monkees commit group suicide by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge ! Take drugs take a lot of drugs take as many drugs as the cast and crew evidently did while making this film ! With Head the Monkees revealed themselves as the angriest snottiest entertainers in Hollywood history bar none . It is bewildering to discover that they blamed the failure of this film on bad promo . To be sure the promotion was virtually non but did they not recognize how angry how down depressing how self this film actually is ? mean this film is a trip on bad acid to the suicide ward of a mental hospital . The only film know to be this depressing is Terry Gilliam's Brazil and like Brazil this film reveals why life in the later Century was almost unbearable if you were lucky . It's not simply that Western culture was suffering from serious information but the information itself was just bad bad more bad and dismal . In fact it was the overload effect itself that kept people going since this allowed people to keep distracting themselves with one crisis or another if news from Vietnam became too much to bear they could turn the channel and watch a documentary on the rising unemployment rate . The positive'' response to the reality revealed in Head was Woodstock three days of peace and love and nudity and mud and bugs and bad food and dirty drink and poop and pee and bad acid and Peter Townsend almost killing Abbie Hoffman . All taking place behind a steel fence under the lovingly watchful eyes of a veritable army of NY State Troopers meaning that the freedom'' of Woodstock Nation was as illusory as the song John Sebastion thought he was singing while so strung out he could barely speak . assholes too stupid to come in out of the rain was one critic's judgment on Woodstock think it was Andy Warhol The one good thing occurring there was Jimi Hendrix's Star Spangled Banner . Two years previously the Jimi Hendrix Experience had gone on their first National tour of America as the warm band opening for the Monkees . See it's all connected somehow . You owe it to yourself nay you owe it to your unborn children to see the real only to be found on film in this bizarre miraculous and utterly absurd tribute to one of the more interesting capitalist scams of the later Century .
9938_8.txt,1, young theater actress reluctantly accepts her first major part in a staged play as Lady Macbeth thanks to the mishap of the production's diva falling in front of a moving car . success winning her accolades Betty Marsillach instead horror as the one responsible for getting her to this point terrorizes her in cruel ways . First her stage manager boyfriend Stefano McNamara viciously stabbed with a knife while she has to watch rope to a pillar in his uncle's vast mansion keeping her eyes from closing thanks to needles scotch under her eyes with pricking a result if she blinks . Allowing her to escape Betty again finds herself in this unfortunate position when a specific gold chain is found on her Lady Macbeth wardrobe that had been torn to shreds by the madman after killing a series of crows which escaped from their cage in the equipment room by the clothing designer who is first knocked to the floor by an iron and subsequently stabbed heinously by a pair of scissors cap off this nasty scene the chain falls into her throat with the killer having to cut open her throat to find it while not specifically elaborating this act Dario uses the ripping sound of the scissors for optimum effect with the camera often retreating back to the victim's dead face Having nowhere to turn Inspector Alan Santini Barberini playing him cold and bland at Dario's request to catch the psycho as Betty relies on her few remaining friends for comfort the theater director Marco Charleson of GHANDI CHARIOTS OF FIRE who would later die of AIDS sad footnote Dario revealed in an interview that Charleson informed him at the end of the shoot that he was HIV positive the stage after a successful horror movie career despite being rejected by critics and pal Mira Nicolodi Dario's former squeeze her agent and confident . But the serial killer is quite driven and a showdown between them will of course occur in the theater as Marco has added an interesting change to the production using the crows at his disposal . think this is Dario at his most savage nihilistic . Although he has certainly made later gruesome films as his Masters of Horror entries and SLEEPLESS would suggest this film really ups the ante in pure violence towards the victims of the psychopath . His method of forcing Betty to watch was admittedly a gag by Dario regarding the type of audience who like to look away from the more horrific parts of horror movies . found myself rubbing my eyes every time she just has to blink Dario shoots the pricking from point achieving a tormenting effect from our perspective as if we were the ones with the scotch taped needles holding our eyes open like how Dario will show the widened eyes of Betty horrified at what she's being forced into watching as little blood tears down the needles when she has no choice but blink . The photographic work of Ronnie Taylor is impeccable such as the crow's point shot in the theater at the end as it searches for the killer . Or when the camera travels'' through rooms in the theater following the killer who wishes to see his muse from a box seat . Or the dream sequence where we are taken into Betty's memory of an event regarding her mother's death by a certain killer donning the same mask and gloves as the one causing her trauma at present . The highlight in my opinion is the peephole bullet sequence masterly staged by all involved as the camera follows a bullet which shoots through the eye of a victim exploding from the back of her head going through a telephone Betty planned to use to call for help . We even get a crow pecking the eyeball from the killer add to this vicious scene the crow is shown with the eyeball rolling around in it's beak Only aspect did n't care for often pointed out by naysayers of the film is the final'' ending which personally felt was a bit unnecessary but guess Dario wanted to point out that Betty was indeed not like her mother a woman with sadomasochistic tendencies which in a twist relate to why the killer torments our heroine . The rock music used during the violent scenes did n't bother me because felt that those moments of wicked graphic attacks needed a jarring thud which heavy metal can often provide .
2775_10.txt,1, Susie is an original and is n't like those other bad Disney film a boy named Zach moves to a new town and has trouble at school he is good basketball . a girl in the died with her boyfriend when their car was crashed off a bridge .

1634_7.txt,1, Before seeing the sneak preview today of Angels Demons cleared my mind of any uncertainties that might hold me back from enjoying it the enormous amount of hatred towards Dan Brown the fact that it was written by Dan Brown and because Dan Brown's name is slapped on all of the posters . went in with an open mind and expected the worse but instead what got was a and a half hour Roman cat and mouse game with Forrest Gump and that is by all means good entertainment value . The movie hangs loosely on the actual novel itself . Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon jets off to Rome after the Pope's sudden death and the re through Papal Conclave . Arranging all of this is the carmelengo Patrick McKenna However he soon learns of a new threat one that involves a secret brotherhood making its presence known an anti time bomb that Vatican City is now targeted with and the kidnapping of four cardinals . Langdon using his intellects trust me you'll be hearing a LOT from it is given the task of finding and rescuing them using the mysterious Path of Illumination . Aiding him on the quest is CERN scientist Vittoria Vetra who is also the co of the anti The movie itself runs at an uneven pace . One minute Langdon and the Swiss Guard are speeding to save a branded cardinal the next minute he bores you with pointless information about every random object he passes evidently slowing the book's much anticipated action sequences down . It makes for an interesting read on paper but on screen it can go either way . The character's are decently written onto the big screen . Ewan McGregor does a convincing performance as the quiet but knowledgeable Patrick McKenna famous accent included . Tom Hanks is slightly more agile intellectually and physically since his last performance in the mediocre Da Vinci Code . Stellen Skarsgard plays Commander Richter the straight leader of the Swiss Guard . Unfortunately neither his nor Ayelet Zurer's performance are worthwhile ones and instead of playing a part in the story they are just kicked aside as assets . However Angels Demons accomplishes what DVC could never a thrilling fast movie filled with satisfying explosions beautiful recreations of St. Peter's Square and Basilica many of the churches and a pulsing bomb counting down the midnight hour . Ron Howard does a decent job at directing this second Langdon adventure this time taking in much criticism and almost completely exchanging the boring dialogue for tense chases While newcomers might call it a National Treasure with a much larger threat there is still enough contagious suspense eye and brilliant still shots of Rome to breathe in . Fans of the book might feel differently towards the movies drastic changes but considering the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracy it generates does exceedingly well at keeping the viewer locked on to the screen this time rather than on their sleepy shoulder . good book adaption that will both appeal and entertain .
8936_7.txt,1, Watching Plots with a View'' Undertaking Betty'' in the US got the feeling that there need to be more movies filmed in Wales . This one portrays a woman Blethyn in a small Welsh town trying to get away from her cheating husband . So she and the funeral parlor manager Molina come up with a plan . there are likely to be some glitches along the way . would actually say that Christopher Walken's character is the neatest in the movie could he not be ? But overall the whole idea is just a really neat one stacked with some uh oh'' moments . the haunted house scene . It's the sort of movie that wish that could enter just to experience it . Also starring Lee Evans Naomi Watts and Miriam Margoyles .
2968_7.txt,1, After seeing Meredith in Beyond the Prairie'' had to buy another film with her staring . can not believe how she let herself into this teenage flick . It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen . Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on Beyond the Prairie'' It's worth it at any price this one needs to pay you to see . This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman . Perhaps some of her latest might fit but have n't seen them . She has the smile of a Cathrine Bell and eyes of Dana Delany with a much younger body .
8973_7.txt,1, Well we definitely did see and and many other people were actually expecting worse . It did have some good parts too it that was not expecting it still did fail in other areas though . First off the acting was above average . love Phillip Seymour Hoffman in this movie and liked Tom Hanks . Hoffman was the glue to this movie . If it were not for him this movie would have crumbled and hit rock bottom . His performance was by no means stunning but absolutely necessary . He gave a good witty cynical performance in what most other actors could have easily made his character into a clich Tom Hanks really gave a nice loose performance and did not disappoint but he certainly did not impress . What could not stand was that Julia Roberts was involved in this movie . She was as big of a miscast as have ever seen . For one she is a bad actress at least to me she was to young for her character and was to phony even for the character she was playing . The directing was average to me . I'm not really a big fan of the recent Mike Nichols movies and I'm not exactly impressed by this one either . It was made with such a Hollywoodish cartoonish touch hat could not stand . The worst part about it was that he tried make it be a really meaningful movie at the end . love meaningful movies but not when a movie tries to rush a scene or two at the end and show something that tries to justify the rest of the garbage spread throughout the whole movie . That is something that Mike Nichols has seemed to have done a lot in his recent track record . The one impressive part of this movie was the writing . The dialog was put together very well and was able to let the story play out . The writing was what was able to really able to take this movie to an above average level . In so many scenes found myself laughing in part by the writing . Well that is some of what we saw at least . lot of the scenery was good in the movie if you get what mean but not a lot other than that . did like that this movie did not glorify everything America had done . It is obvious that during this whole war in Afghanistan the gave weapons to the people who are now against us . This movie kind of show we are too blame for that . It shows that what may seem good in the short term may turn into something horribly wrong in the future . This movie did have a good original message but it just did not deliver it right . Overall though it was entertaining .
1911_8.txt,1, blaxploitation classic this movie was terribly influential in rap music for the toasts'' that Rudy Ray Moore performs . Toasts are long rhyming stories that are funny and deliver a point and you can see how they would naturally evolve into rap . For more on toasts Rudy Ray Moore and why this movie is important go to Dolemite . Which leaves us just to talk about the movie itself . This movie packs in a great deal of laugh bang for the buck as nearly every shot has some sort of outrageous element or dialogue . It starts as Dolemite is being released from prison in order to find out who framed him and bring him to justice . was unaware that prisons release people so they can prove their own innocence but that's me I'm a neophyte in the prison scene . He is helped in this by Queen Bee who is Dolemite's lead prostitute and has been running his brothel while he's been gone . She has also put all of his prostitutes through karate school so now he has an army of female karate fighters . watched this movie in two parts which is usually a mistake but in this case it provided an interesting contrast . The first part watched on my lunch break while exercising and was n't enjoying it much at all . It struck me as particularly poorly made blaxploitation with a ludicrous story shoddy craftsmanship guess that makes it sound like it had SOME craftsmanship tons of outrageous locales outfits and dialogue . But was n't enjoying that fact it kind of made me feel dirty . Let's face it a white guy watching something like this to laugh at the outfits and the things the characters say is essentially getting an enjoyment out of it that is racist how ridiculously those black people dress what silly things they say . was n't really enjoying it was n't laughing and was n't looking forward to watching the rest . Later that night when was in a much more relaxed state watched the rest legitimately loved it . Like Disco Godfather which had watched a few days previously this has a warmth and sweetness at its core that makes it likable even when it's silly or violent . The character of Dolemite has an element of self about him that makes the whole thing fun and the appearance of several actors who were also in Disco Godfather implies that we're watching the group effort of a bunch of friends who just want to make something fun together . Even the poor dubbing karate fights and everything else just makes it that much more charming . What find interesting about the Dolemite films is that they have some moral ambiguity do n't see in other blaxploitation films and certainly in very few mainstream films . In this one there is an African woman who gives a speech about the Mayor saying he has done more for the black community than anyone . We later find out that the Mayor is surprise corrupt but like that the movie would present this woman as essentially misguided and not try to redeem'' her in some other way . There's also the figure of the Hamburger Pimp who is presented as a useless junkie and no one makes an effort to find some redeeming socially positive angle to what he is he just is . In Disco Godfather the religious character Lady Reed plays is presented as just nuts for wanting to pray for her child hopelessly lost to angel dust . like that the films would present such harshly critical portrayals of people in their own community without sugar or trying to redeem them to make them more palatable . There are a lot of hootworthy elements such as when Dolemite says Move over and let me pass or I'm gon na be pulling these Hush Puppies out your muthatf There is Queen Bee reaching over and answering the phone Dolemite's Total Experience . And you will not be able to miss you may wish to cover your eyes the extended nude scene by the REPULSIVE Mayor . am all for mustachioed pervy older men but even have limits my limits are usually a few miles past most people's so be warned . The DVD had is clearly edited which is noticeable in certain of the dialogue scenes and at the end when Dolemite's killing of a major character with his bare hands obviously excludes the main event . If you do get the DVD however be sure to watch all three trailers for the Dolemite films as they are a hoot . was n't going to watch The Human Tornado but after seeing that trailer you'd better BELIEVE that am . Also there is a scene in the Dolemite trailer that do n't remember from the movie when Dolemite swings at a Mexican thug obviously misses and the guy flips himself into a nearby car trunk . After watching the first half was going to say to skip this and watch Disco Godfather as the film and story has marginally improved but after really enjoying the second half would advise watching this one over Disco Godfather as this one is even more exuberantly fun outrageous and good has those toasts which even if one does n't understand the roots and nuances of the form are still something to see .

5839_9.txt,1, ca n't stand people who comment on this program or other HBO programs as too graphic'' or unnecessarily graphic'' or that they contain gratuitous nudity etc'' Guess what ? Prison life is n't PG The gratuitous'' graphic content is TRUE TO LIFE of this situation . Prison contains inmate rape deals and showers . If you do n't like it then do n't watch the program . I'm certainly no fan of prison rape but if it was left out of the show I'd be surprised and lend the show less credibility . If the prisoners did n't curse it would just be silly . Sure it's gratuitous language but that is REALISTIC . The show is good some of the viewers . so much guess .
2383_8.txt,1, Scooby Doo and the Monster of Mexico was no doubt the weakest of the modern Scooby Doo animated features . Loch Ness Monster is a considerable improvement . This time the gang head off to Scotland to see the Highland Games and visit Blake castle Daphne's ancestral home . And would n't you know the castle happens to be in the fishing village of Drumnadrochit on the shores of Loch Ness . During their stay they meet a few interesting folks . First there is Fiona Pembrooke a scientist who has drowned all of her money into finding the Loch Ness Monster . Sir Ian Locksley the boss of the National Heritage Museum of Scotland he is staunch non of Nessie . The Haggarts the own a cozy Inn on the shores of the loch . The sons are a couple of local jokers always into mischief . Del Chilman a wild paranoid hippie dude who is convinced the monster is out there and will stop at nothing on find her . And finally Duncan MacGubbin the dock master who has seen Nessie too many times to count . Most of these characters are stereotypes which gets a bit annoying as this is teaching younger audiences a load of crap and giving the wrong impression . However if you can immune yourself to it you'll be alright . Being from Scotland ca n't help but wince at the awfully mimicked Scottish accents . Fact We DO N'T sound like that . Soon enough Nessie looking rather more demonic than shows up and causes havoc . Looks like the gang have another mystery on their hands . The usual chase scenes clues and Shaggy's wacky disguises follow . There are plenty of laughs . The animation is splendid with some atmospheric scenes and locations . And the plot a lot better than Monster of Mexico . The only bad thing this time around is the music . miss Louis Febre's scoring and the songs here are pretty rotten too . Where are the Hex Girls when you need The region DVD is in crystal clear anamorphic widescreen region ai n't with Dolby sound . Some okay extras are included . Definitely worth getting .
10356_7.txt,1, American final entry in the Blood Island'' series of Filipino horror films concerns Abdul Amir Hadley ruler of a fictional country . He dies of cancer yet it's figured out how to bring him back put his brain into a donor body . The mad doctor in charge Taylor puts it in a highly unlikely body the facially scarred giant manservant named Gor Bloom doctor friend of the ruler tries to remedy matters and put an end to the mad doctors plans . Film partners Samuel Sherman and Al Adamson corral several actors they've worked with before including Taylor Adamsons sexy wife Regina Carrol Angelo Rossitto Zandor Vorkov and Vicki Volante . They tried to go for the feel of the previous Blood Island'' entries but one can tell this was made stateside . While not necessarily a good'' film it's got a bunch of amusing elements to add up to an entertainingly trashy whole . malevolent dwarf gory operations a rather unconvincing makeup job on Bloom the political intrigue subplot caverns full of cobwebs etc . The narrative is actually pretty coherent with plot twists thrown in here and there . think it could have been trimmed a bit some scenes drag . But it's got its fun moments and an ending people might not expect . For this kind of thing the acting is n't too bad . Both Taylor and Rossitto are fun the latter seems to be having quite a good time in his role . Volante is appealing enough and Williams is in the heroic role . In any event it's nice to see all of these familiar faces in one of these films . Absolutely nothing special but as a trashy horror'' use the word loosely none of this is exactly scary film it certainly amuses .
148_9.txt,1, director Park Chun returns with what must be one of the yuckiest and at the same time most serious vampire flicks in movie history . Trusting the latest Hollywood fad vampires these days are supposed to be rather nonviolent asexual love chevaliers instead of the evil rampantly sexual blood mind man of yore . This is the film you want to see if you want to remember the sticky thrills of the past . well at least in the second half . starts out with a lengthy character exposition culminating in a slightly different love story . The vampire transformation of a priest is over quite some time sidelined by the romantic and sexual aspects of the story which makes for some awkward viewing . But the last minutes or so are surprisingly gory . Well maybe not so surprisingly if you know and a Cyborg but that's OK but guess it's fair to say that beats Park's earlier films in terms of in violence . All in all be warned that this is neither art cinema nor a horror flick . It may be too disgusting for many and too tame for some . is original entertaining and fortunately a little less weird than Park Chun earlier endeavors .
2604_7.txt,1, After Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman'' with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than Dorothy Provine from It's Mad Mad Mad Mad World'' to play the role . The downsize is that cute and blonde Provine may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into Allison Hayes size shoes . This role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal Provine is more the girl next door type . She may have taken and done this role to prove she could be sexy but the material lets her down . Lou Costello however proves he can do a movie without Bud Abbott feeding him lines and he even interjects a dramatic role in some of his scenes when he not turning to Gale Gordon as his front man for gags . Gordon however establishes that all he can be is blustery perturbed and pushy much the same character he creates later on The Lucy Show . Charles Lane also plays the same role in everything he does a straight man and his screen time is limited . The special effects are convincing for the time but would have liked Dorothy to have been a little more than cheesecake and dressing and at least have been allowed to become dangerous . As the movie's lead character she takes second billing to Costello who is in all of the movie with Dorothy several times vanishing like a sub The whole movie put together just ca n't decide if it's supposed to be science fiction a comedy or just a parody of the Allison Hayes classic . There's a lot of good scenes some very funny humor and some very ridiculous camp that affects the rest of the film . Still do like this movie for it's empowerment of women there's not enough movies out there like this one . If this movie had a chance to be remade today I'd highly recommend Courtney Cox and Jason Alexander in the lead roles and allow me to completely re the original script . Courtney tops my lists of actresses who believe could and should adequately play gorgeous giantesses although have to admit that if either of the titanic beauties Allison or Dorothy came after me I'd go quietly
8510_8.txt,1, I'm sick and tired of people complaining that Never Say Never Again is just a weak remake of Thunderball . Yes that movie's influence is unmistakable but the tremendous and almost universal inferiority of re films is reserved for such thoughtless and unintelligent films like the re of Psycho . While it's true that the opening theme of the twelfth Connery's last Bond film is one of the worst of the entire series the film itself still manages to stand on its own despite many other weaknesses . Besides that even the weak title song is made to blend pretty nicely with the closing dialogue in the film . Sure Sean Connery was getting a little on in age when this movie was filmed least by James Bond standards but there is plenty of evidence in the narrative that makes it clear that this was not exactly unknown to the filmmakers . James Bond is near retirement before he is handed his assignment having spent most of recent time teaching not doing and there is even the tongue in cheek insistence from that he pay more attention to his health dieting and training and getting more exercise and whatnot . Besides this is James Bond remember ? This guy is supposed to be some kind of super human and all of his fans are getting all upset because he's got some gray hairs . When this guy retires at the end of the film sends poor a hilarious cameo from Rowan Atkinson to tell Bond that without him he worries about the safety of the free world and all of you people ca n't get over the fact that he's not a sprightly young man anymore . Come on Sean Connery could STILL play James Bond just as good as he ever could or at least better than anyone else ever has been able to . The majority of the film deals with the elaborate plan to steal nuclear missiles and hold the world hostage Dr . Evil would say hell let's just do what we always do'' so there's clearly not much new there but this is one of the Bond films that had the better one liners . There's the amusing scene where Bond is asked for a urine sample you could just fill this beaker for me'' here ? There are a lot of good one but the sexual innuendos aimed at Mr . Bond are especially prevalent in this installment . But then later he happens to throw that very urine sample into a villain's face making him scream as if his face were burning off . Not a very good attempt at comic relief especially since this guy had been kicking Bond's ass with some sort of super device that could cut through pretty much anything . And of course Kim Basinger stars in this film as one of the best Bond girls of the entire series . It's no secret that Never Say Never Again has dated badly and one of the things that has dated the worst is the special effects with the one exception of the flying missiles which were obviously fake but still impressive for The colored contact lens at the beginning of the film was totally without effect and the laser watch was one of the worst things in the entire movie second only to those damn sharks . Evidently Fatima Blush put some sort of device on his scuba tank that attracted sharks they did have weird guiding mechanisms of their own in a scene that more than likely inspired the classic line have one simple request . And that is to have sharks with FRICKIN laser beams attached to their heads ! And then of course there is the exploding hotel room scene which was redone in an episode of The Simpsons and which was obviously followed by another obligatory and overly casual one from James . The domination video game created by Largo the film's villain is an especially memorable scene and the film also boasts what is probably the best motorcycle chase in the entire series to superior to the laughable one in Tomorrow Never Dies But despite many strengths the film's weaknesses are left clearer in the audience's mind at the end of the film due in large part to the anticlimactic underwater conclusion of the more obvious parts borrowed from Thunderball and inferiorly recreated Never mind the fact that Largo revealed some crucial information to Bond as he left him in the tower alive Evil's brilliance once again just leave him there without actually witnessing his death and just assume everything went to plan . What ? the climax of what is expected to be a fast action film should never take place in a muted underwater atmosphere . All in all Never Say Never Again ranks very highly on the James Bond scale and Connery's wink at the end of the film well as the two closing lines suggested at the time that he may still return for another turn as Bond . Clearly this is no longer very likely so we can only hope .
9788_10.txt,1, This film is not at all as bad as some people on here are saying . think it has got a decent horror plot and the acting seem normal to me . People are way over what was wrong with this . It is simply classic horror the type without a plot that we have to think about forever and forever . We can just sit back relax and be scared .
12178_7.txt,1, have n't read the Anne Rice novel that this movie was based on but who knows maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting QUEEN OF THE DAMNED and is probably better for your health . It is n't that this movie is necessarily bad for your health but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie . You can count the number of pages by Anne Rice that I've read on one hand but after seeing this movie and Interview with a Vampire get the feeling that she writes really good novels . The plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history . Still Stuart Townsend's voice narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than Brad Pitt's vampire narrative ever did and you can tell that QUEEN OF THE DAMNED's limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the Anne Rice storyline . While Interview decided to go with lace and elegance QUEEN relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously . One can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places . The costumes and rock roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack . However I'll give credit where credit is due . The soundtrack is excellent . Korn and Disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like Butthead . The film opens with a very cool Goth zoom splice montage but after the first ten minutes or so the directing degenerates quickly . It's as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there was n't enough time and enough money to do an Anne Rice novel justice . What results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects . Unfortunately QUEEN OF THE DAMNED fails to do the genre justice just as its John Carpenter counterparts fail to impress . Where are the yellow contacts ? Where's the pale blue make Scene after scene shook my head reminiscing about the days of Salem's Lot and Fright Night when low budget was done right . There are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage . Props to Aaliyah and may her soul forever rest in peace . She might have become a renowned actress had her life not been taken from us so prematurely for she did give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing . Did mention that the soundtrack was good ? Let's see what else can say ? It was n't too long . The Anne Rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like Francis Ford Coppola got his hands on it . There are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot . But all in all it was a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of second vampire movies out there . The director of this movie went on to direct a new Battlestar Galactica mini series if that tells you anything . JY Jimboduck
1581_8.txt,1, know that Guts of a Beauty and Guts of a Virgin are crap films and are hated by many but I'm gon na put myself under the bus here and say like especially Guts of a Beauty Entrails of a Beautiful Woman Watched it the other night with some folks at the pad and was surprised how well it actually went over . Entrails is the type of madcap cheapo horror softcore sleaze epic that you really just do n't find too much of outside of Asia Japan in this case It's basically a rape flick with a reincarnated monster instead of some silly shotgun murders or a motorboat noose or even a ticked off Daddy with a chainsaw . stuff's just silly . Would n't you rather see a hermaphroditic monster with a hilarious little snake monster for a winky ? PERVERSION FACTOR This movie is high in graphic sometimes wacky rape sequences fake pop shots and satisfying masturbation and monster sex sequences that you oughta like if you like Corman nuggets like Humanoids From The Deep . dunno maybe that's a stretch but personally did n't think Entrails of a Beautiful Woman let me down as an avid fan of Asian sleaze and bizarro Yeah know sometimes some of my recommendations are not always everyone's cuppa tea for those of you who like the same kind of garbage as do but stand behind this one .
8831_10.txt,1, Duck needs to watch this film again as his major criticism is completely baseless . The film never once forgot about the time delay and it was mentioned explicitly in a couple of places . The crew were never shown having conversations with mission control that did n't obey the time delay rules . One thing did think was a bit far was the amount of risk involved would a crew land on a planet on which pressure suits would only last two hours ? doubt it . Would a manned space ship go into a star's corona ? doubt it . Would humans land on a moon that was being bombarded with huge amounts of radiation ? doubt it . Also the ship seemed overly sturdy . Would a ship designed like that risk atmospheric flight to slow it down ? doubt it . Would it survive being hit by comet debris ? doubt it . think in both cases the stresses on the structure would be too much . But all the unlikely scenarios were compensated by some nicely done special effects good editing and production and some good acting especially by the actors portraying the ship's commander and the Russian cosmonaut .
5437_8.txt,1, Actually I'll admit I'm a political junkie so this resonated with me but the erratic nature of Ms. Green know what they did to her but the ending was such a copout and totally inconsistent with the film itself . Why ca n't Barry and crew just left us wondering what he was going to do ? Let us debate it . Instead they have this oh I'm not worthy'' bullshit ending and it just shows that when the chips were down it's better to leave the table instead of doubling down . Stop the Disney ending and putting a bow on it . Life is n't easy they should have had the courage to give the main character some backbone . We had to listen to the rhetoric the entire movie . and then it turned sniveling and the stupid inane behavior by Ms. Green the crap was out of her system just made for a ridiculous near end of the movie that was icing on the cake .
1894_10.txt,1, find this film meretricious tentative lethargic and skillfully a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid . But admire the courage to throw away a script turn the camera on and act a fool . find the inauspiciously performances lighting cinematography sound and whatever film school laws Urville Martin broke funny . Speaking from a film directors perspective there is times just want to drop everything and have fun on the set . This film looks like fun . When other aspiring film directors ask me advice just tell them to watch any film by Rudy Ray Moore . They always return a puzzled look asking me why not watch the masters Woody Allen Scorsese Lucas Capra ? laugh and include that you always want to know what not to do in cinematic story telling first .
536_7.txt,1, Since am a fan of Natalie Portman had to see the movie . enjoyed every minute of it . It plays out in a very sincere way . Throughout the whole movie at seemed as if Natalie was the mother and Susan was the mother . Susan's character kept making bad decisions and kept getting burned because of it . heard that there was supposed to be a love scene involving Natalie and some in Outside Providence but Natalie would only accept the script if that scene was removed . And think that is great . think that a love scene would have ruined the tone of the film . Natalie must have a knack for picking good movies to be in because have n't seen her in a bad film yet . So any movie that has Natalie Portman will no doubt be seen by me . good film .
11285_8.txt,1, Begotten . magic . Terror . slight boredom . That Begotten'' is for acquired tastes goes without saying do n't just happen to watch it unless your friends are real art movie buffs . must dig the weird macabre bizarre . must dig cool flicks . you must dig to find diamonds . Begotten'' is one of the most visually dazzling and mystifying films ever known to man . visual part is something to behold no one can prepare you for . since the film is devoid of any type of dialogue visual part is pretty much the only part . is a visual film . soundscapes created for the film are magical and groundbreaking but still . sight of it . God commits suicide in a particularly gory scene then from his corpse rises Mother Earth who impregnates herself with God's semen and gives birth to Flesh on Bone retarded child . then abandons him he gets tortured by heathen creatures . comes back save him ? but she and her son get murdered by the horrible creatures . The film is about the meaninglessness of life about the fact that we come to this planet to suffer and to die that when something dies something else is born etc . The film's no . quality is of course the visuals setting haunting images other quality . you're done watching feel like an alien . THAT mesmerizing . When people say it should last instead of they're right . they're not could last just that everything happens to such a slow pace . fact plot summary provided is all that happens in the film no kidding . do n't know . a flame burning away the darkness .
1083_7.txt,1, Once again must play something of the contrarian . Most of the reviews for Ab Tak Chappan have been extremely positive . Mine is positive but only slightly . out of is equivalent to a letter grade from me . It seems that a lot of the praise is rooted in two factors One that Ab Tak Chappan is more realistic than the typical Bollywood film and two that it is trying to do things differently . The first point could n't care less about . I'm not looking for realism in films and so do not score higher for a film that shows a story and characters closer to how believe the real world to be a big fan of surrealism fantasy absurdism and so on although do not dislike realist films merely for the fact that they're realist . For the second point agree that it is commendable to try to do things differently . However do n't think originality'' versus formulaicism makes for a better or worse film in itself . film can be original'' and poor just like a film can be formulaic and excellent . What matters are how well the film does whatever it sets out to do and how enjoyable or aesthetically rewarding that is to the viewer . Ab Tak Chappan is based on the true story of a Mumbai cop named Daya Naik . Naik was an encounter specialist'' Encounter specialists who could be said to be early instantiations of real world Judge Dredds'' are trained to operate like the criminals and gang members they pursue and they're basically given a license to kill acting as policeman judge jury and executioner in a matter of moments . Ab Tak Chappan follows the story of Sadhu Agashe Patekar the encounter specialist based on Naik . We see him at work interacting with his fellow encounter specialists and engaging in violence . We see him at home trying to live a normal life in his less surroundings . We see him trying to adjust to a new commissioner'' halfway through the film . And we see his odd relationship with a notorious Indian gangster Don Zameer Zafar Purandhare All of this has the potential to make a fabulous gritty film . agree that it's nice to forgo the typical Bollywood musical numbers and romances every film needs that stuff Ab Tak Chappan producer Ram Gopal Varma is famous for leaving music and romances in the background or by the wayside in many films that he's directed or produced . Additionally Ab Tak Chappan has some good performances almost gives off a Death Wish Charles Bronson vibe . It also has admirable cinematography hand stuff near the beginning of the film was particularly effective for example . It has a great score that mixes more of a moody Hollywood action score with traditional Indian instruments and modalities . The violence is well done and gritty . There is also decent exploration of subtexts including the morality of encounter specialists the idea of following orders and so on . The encounter specialists are shown having to largely divorce themselves from ideas of right and wrong . More poignantly the film questions the merit of blindly following orders . Parallels are drawn between the encounter specialists following orders and say members of a country's military and we're shown what a corrupt situation this can lead to . But just knew there was a But'' coming did n't you ? director Shimit Amin and his scriptwriters have created a story with far too many characters far too much sprawl and that moves a bit too slow . All of these problems may be due to Amin and crew looking at the Godfather films which Ab Tak Chappan has some least superficial resemblances to although from a policeman's perspective . Most of the encounter specialists we do not get to know very well are shallowly drawn characters to say the least except for Agashe and Jatin Shukla Vaid For one Narayan did n't know who he was until at least halfway through the film . His name is mentioned a number of times but I'd only get glimpses of him until the scene would change . Then everyone would change clothes by the time they appear again and I'd have to start all over figuring out who Narayan was . The same thing happened with Agashe's first commissioner . The film was already far into the new commissioner before could figure out the relationships . It seems like there are new characters in every scene . We never learn the stories of most of them . While that might have some artistic merit in that the encounter specialists are mostly killing people they do not know anything about they're mostly doing so on orders since we do not learn much about most of the encounter specialists either it's difficult to find characters to care about and that does n't exactly make for a gripping film . The primary villain is Zameer . But until about halfway through the film there's no indication of this . He does n't get much more screen time than the other villains parading through the film and he's literally phoning his performance in'' in another location communicating only by telephone for the majority of the film . We do n't actually see Zameer doing much . To an extent the film depends on a couple twists'' that necessitate not showing Zameer doing a number of things but we could see him do other things and a lot of the other villains could have been left out . That would have tightened up the film a bit making it more focused and about a half shorter both of which would have benefited its impact . This is not an action film by any means . For at least the first minutes or so found myself admiring Ab Tak Chappan's considerable style but saying Okay get on with the story already''
7107_7.txt,1, House of Dracula'' is n't all that bad of a film and is rather decent at times . Arriving at the home of Dr. Franz Edelmann Stevens in his seaside home Count Dracula Carradine discreetly seeks a cure for vampirism . He starts work on a potential cure involving blood transfusion the Wolf Man Lawrence Talbot Chaney Jr. arrives at his estate looking for a cure to lycanthropy . Working with the two patients he discovers a possible cure in a mold found near the laboratory and after searching the area he finds the Frankenstein Monster Strange buried nearby . Becoming obsessed with reviving it Dr. Edelmann keeps neglecting Dracula and Larry's requests and after demanding that they get their treatment instead of him working on the Monster they turn on each other in a climactic showdown . The Good News This was a rather decent film . There is one main idea that is quite creative and imaginative . This is the first film to openly propose the idea of vampirism as a blood disease and one that can be transferred from person to person through the exchange of bodily fluid something that would be taken up by later genre works but rarely as directly as this . There's even a microscope slide of the parasite that is believed responsible for the condition . It works in some rather nicely used ideas and comes across as a rather nifty idea even if some of the execution is a little stale . The fact that each of the creatures has at least one standout scene is a nicely done idea . The Wolf Man has a marvelous scene where he transforms inside a prison cell to the doubting members of the search party and goes crazy . Dracula's initial appearance of appearing as a bat and flying toward a prone figure sleeping and then appearing in human form looks really impressive . The Monster rampage is well handled and an appropriate amount of destruction is caused . The large bat that Dracula transforms into always looks decent for once and is quite realistically done . It's a thoroughly decent affair . The Bad News There are several things that were n't all that great about this one . The fact that the film combines so much potentially intriguingly plots and ideas that it really does n't know what to do with them . There are several different back that have to be mingled together and which should be clear enough to mix well together and seem coherent . This really does n't have any of that . The plot is rather flimsy and does n't really give a preferential treatment to any of the stars and instead concentrates on one then another and then includes all three in the ending . The monsters only seem to get engaged with each other for the smallest possible reason makes it a big distraction . The ending is for once a big let and seems entirely like it was changed at the last minute . There's a few other small things that were n't all that spectacular and pretty much also contribute to this . The Final Verdict It's quite a decent film and manages to get through most of the time with an entertaining style . Nowhere near the classic status of each monsters debut features but it's a nice enough watch for fans of the monsters and of Universal films in general . Today's Rating Violence
10219_9.txt,1, This movie is masterly directed by Clive barker he really knows how to establish a rapport between the audience and the characters . think there is a sequel missing for this one Barker should have dedicated to the sequel for this movie instead of doing the boring Lord of illusions that is one think was a real garbage . But also think that because of this and because of the lack of the sequel NBreed has become a dark cult classic of horror films .

We are consummate experts in the art of bad movie and this film was quickly placed in the top of awful movies . so if you've just got the beers and weed in and need a film to laugh like a drain at DROID GUNNER aka PHOENIX is the film for you ! Marc Singer is totally aware he's in a turkey of a film here and milks it for everything he can ! Matthius Hues is sublime in his wooden acting and musclebound moronity that a word ? as he grunts But want my thousand ! Pure Shlock Gold !

1379_10.txt,1, was trying to work out why enjoyed this film ? Its not because of money spent on it that's for sure ! Did see a painted water pistol in there ? Maybe they do n't have the same sort of visual effects houses in the Scotland ? Or maybe they just did n't have any money ? The making of clearly shows a gang of very plucky guys making a movie against the odds . Awesome ! But what really liked was the grit of the performances . Mike Michell and Patrick White play the lead parts like normal guys . No Hollywood histrionics here . OK so the effects work is n't very good . The spaceships just do n't look as good as they should in todays FX world and I've seen much better free stuff on youtube . But the film holds together very well once they get to the Planet . Was this filmed in Scotland or just by a Scottish crew ? Or is it just better effects work ? Did they edit out the water ? By the end kinda loved this film and was disappointed when they all died .
4552_8.txt,1, Well on the day that Rob Schneider plunges himself further into the black hole of notoriously bad movies by starring in the absolutely not Deuce Bigalow European Gigolo'' there a film called Roadtrip which was followed by a sequel called Eurotrip ? And now there's Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo followed by sequel Deuce Bigalow European Gigolo . smell a pattern . Perhaps soon there will be Spiderman European webs are Hotter . not am writing about this much maligned time of release film . was one of those maligners must admit . turned my nose up at it even while Chris Farley shoved cocaine up his nose and the SNL cast struggled through one of the worst seasons in their history in the Norm McDonald anchorship notwithstanding . Films like Happy Gilmore Tommy Boy and Black Sheep came out in the couple years after this period and we realized there was a dark future for the caliber of Spade films . However watched this film the other day ten years after and years after Chris died and could not stop laughing . Yes it's not particularly sophisticated . Farley does what Farley does unlike Manny being Manny but his Van Down By the River'' motivational speaker shtick in which he laments that while he may not wash enough'' or wear well clothes'' or use deodorant more than twice a week'' translates well here as the ever self character who realizes he's not the brightest not the best and could stand to lose a few pounds . All the same he's trying his best to do what he's supposed to . And David Spade just tosses off his snide one as he did for Spade's Hollywood Minute'' and basically stings Farley's self There's really not a whole lot more to say than that . love the one scene when Farley catches Spade spanking his monkey and then makes a couple quips about it . Ca n't remember what the first one is but the second one they're lying in their hotel beds and Farley says to Spade Do you like baseball ? Spade mutters something inaudible in response and Farleys says the New York YANK Anyway Farley does his awkward painfully sensitive frat shtick . If you like you like it . could n't stop laughing .
8059_8.txt,1, After World War II the ungoing crime in Phenix City Alabama encouraged by the money from an Army base just across the river in Georgia got even worse . Gambling prostitution loan sharking and the like helped an organized crime apparatus in the city . Soon it was too bad and violent to even tolerate anymore . This movie is based on the real story of that fight . By the standards of the it was shockingly explicit . Although low that same small budget helped with the realism requiring location shooting . very gritty film . Richard Kiley was marvelous as always and John McIntire stolid . Why this good movie is n't on video is a real puzzle !
3493_9.txt,1, The Ali show was really something amazing he was so stupid wannabe rapper but no one he interviewed noticed that he was just pretending . Sasha Cohen is actually very intelligent guy who pretends to be stupid so he could get really honest answers from people . And it is very funny . So did n't expect movie to be good cause it was all acted no real people or interviews . So the basic point of all show was lost . But was wrong laughed all the time it was one of the funniest films ever saw . Sure it was stupid but who cares if you ca n't actually brake in to safe with a car battery like someone said ? It was n't supposed to be a realistic documentary . And it is n't like the show it goes in totally different way but that does n't mean it is bad . When finished watching was totally impressed but now when some time passed realized that it was not that special anyway But it still deserves a nine well at least for what it is supposed to be .

1941_7.txt,1, think this is a pretty good movie but one thing makes it VERY interesting to me . It is blatantly obvious once you look out for it the main characters in this movie are the inspiration for the bullies on The Simpsons . Layne is Jimbo John is Kearney and Tony is Dolph . There is even an episode of The Simpsons where Jimbo uses the line poked her with a stick . The Jimbo connection is the most obvious with the knit hat and long hair and the voice . Kearney has the shaved head unlike John but is the big dumb one . The Tony connection is pretty obvious with the long parted haircut and even the second status .
6389_8.txt,1, The Psychopath trip down memory lane . saw this film many years ago on a old black and white children's show host Mr. Rabbey avenges the brutal abuse that parents inflict upon his kiddie fans . Mr. Rabbey looks like he's always on the verge of losing it finally cracks and decides to go on a hunting trip . Watch out bad parents cause Mr. Rabbey is on the prowl ! What happens next is priceless . However trying to find this movie will be quite a chore . What makes this film notable was the fact that Joe Maniac'' Spinell made a short promo reel for a film based upon this one . In his unfinished film he plays Mr. Robbie a clown looks like a pudgy out of shape Edward James Olmos who avenges his young fans child abuse by going after their parents . Sadly Mr. Spinell could never find the funds to complete the project . The film was going to be titled Maniac II Mister Robbie'' Rabbey or Robbie the similarities are all too close for comfort . Pretty violent for a movie . Recommended .
1699_8.txt,1, this movie is not as bad as some say it is infact think it more enjoyable than the original maybe that why some people hate it as much cos they dont want to admit it a good great movie . most if not all fx were done by which didn mind at all cos it was an enjoyable movie . Phil Buckman was in my opinion the best guy in the movie Julie Delpy was rather attractive she brought the sexiness to the movie . there were a lot of wisecracks in the movie which thought were good . this movie is in my collection but the original is not because dont like it as much as this one . was not bored when watched this movie it kept me watching unlike some horror movies could mention like oh say driller killer suspiria argento movie thats to name but two . this is an ok werewolf film it should be in people collection if they like werewolf movies maybe get the original at some point maybe . have only one complaint and that is Phil Buckman should have been in it more than he was but apart from that the movie was fine . rating for this movie an ok werewolf movie not the worst one out there .
7412_7.txt,1, just saw this movie in a sneak preview and before reading my comment you have to know that it is very subjective because love Techno Trance Club House and music like that . The movie deals with Carl whose brother Jason whatever his name was died in an accident he fell off a rooftop drunk'' Carl meets his brother's girlfriend Sunny and the two of them quite unmotivated some kind of private investigation about Jason's death and Carl gets involved in Jason's ex that was filled with clubs and drugs . The movie itself seen from an artistic point of view is nothing more than a big pile of The plot is predictable all of the characters are extremely cliched and two boy from a small town young good innocent girl big bad drug king . the list is endless and most of the acting such as the plot are just not credible . Matthew Rhys performance of the stupid boy coming to big London and sudden taking drugs from people he does not even know does not seem very credible unlike his female counterpart Sunny performed by Sienna Guillory whose behaviour seems more realistic to the spectator . Nothing more than a joke was Tim Curry's performance of the drug king Damian a phony caricature too eeeevil'' and just too ridiculous to be true . BUT If you like club music club scenes such as the selected tracks are simply brilliant if you enjoy a simple lovestory with a sweet girl like Sunny confess lost my heart that makes my comment even more subjective guess with some twists and turns you will definetely enjoy this movie . Anybody else out of view out of personal view and also my final vote
11987_10.txt,1, liked this movie . No one know likes it but do . did n't like it as much as the first one but it was still good . The script and plot may not have changed at all but the story was better than Caddyshack The only reason did n't like Caddyshack is . NO RODNEY DANGERFIELD ! think the movie would be better if Rodney Dangerfield had Jackie Mason's part . Although did like Jackie Mason in the movie it would be alot better if they kept Rodney Dangerfield . Another flaw in the movie that did n't hate as much was Dan Akroyd . The movie was done years after the first one . Bill Murray Carl'' could've quit his job as an assistant greenskeeper and joined the military you know ? If Warner Bros. had thought of that it could've made the movie better also . This was my comment for Caddyshack II . give it out of It could've been better but good nonetheless . If you've seen Caddyshack and are debating on whether or not to see Caddyshack say give it a try .
12238_10.txt,1, Basically an endearingly chintzy and moronic version of the nifty early subterranean creature feature favorite The Boogens this entertainingly schlocky cheapie centers on a nasty squirmy wriggling monster who makes an instant meal out of any unfortunate souls foolhardy enough to go poking around the notoriously off limits Gold Spike Mine . Your standard motley assortment of intrepid boneheads hectoring hard mine boss cute but insipid blonde babe feisty lady geologist boozy inexplicably Aussie seasoned old mine hand charmless doofus hunky jolly guy and arguably the most annoying character of the uniformly irritating bunch a nerdy bespectacled aspiring writer dweeb who's prone to speaking in flowery melodramatic utterances trek into the dark uninviting cave in search of gold . Naturally these intensely insufferable imbeciles discover that the allegedly abandoned mine is the home of a deadly ugly multi beast who in time honored hoary fashion proceeds to gruesomely bag the group one at a time . Directed co co and co with dumbfounding maladroitness by Melanie Anne Phillips acted with dismaying flatness by a rank no cast further marred by lethargic pacing a drably meandering narrative murky under eye cinematography a shivery redundantly thudding pseudo Carpenter synthesizer score and a cruddy herky stop motion animation wormoid thingie that's only quickly glimpsed at the very end of the movie this extremely clunky amateurish and hence quite delectably dreadful would scarefest commits all the necessary bad film missteps to qualify as a real four stinkeroonie .
5682_10.txt,1, I've read many unflattering comments regarding this film and the only things have seen that they all have in common are boring'' and unrealistic'' First of all they used real frickin crocs ! How much more realistic can you get ? No CGI no animatronics no miniatures . Just a croc and a piece of meat . Have fun fellas ! There is no question that this film gets off to a slow start . Character development what little they had anyway does take a bit of time and think this is primarily where this film lacks . However when the film gets going found the action picked up dramatically . do n't mean to say that there is a lot of action . If anything there are more moments where the croc ca n't be seen at all and the people are just waiting . However we know that there is n't going to be any relief and that the croc is just biding its time . This had a similar eerie feel to other films that achieve their horror through non such as Open Water film that has been criticized by some viewers as being boring'' Personally think that viewers who find themselves incapable of feeling the suspense have had their attention spans surgically removed at birth but that's just me . Finally the characters feel real and the situation is such that it really could happen to anyone in the right circumstances . Furthermore the deaths are completely real and at times it's a little tough to watch . All in all this one's a winner .
6993_8.txt,1, This was a sleeper'' for sure ! Much better than thought ! Never realizing it was a horror flick . who was this gorgeous voiced hunk named Vin Diesel . spice and intrigue to this otherwise unpromoted film The monsters in this film were quite unusual not the same ol run of the mill gobble types ! ending was great too for a change not all bad guys are bad'' give it thumbs up
12380_7.txt,1, The problem with so many people watching this movie is the mindset they watch it in . People come looking for a horror film or a So Bad It's Good'' movie . Jack Frost is neither of these . It is to put it simply a very good movie cleverly hidden inside a very bad one . To view it as anything other than a screwball comedy funnier than all three absolutely meritless Scary Movies'' combined is to misinterpret the movie on a basic level . It would be like watching Shawshank Redemption and then complaining that there were no explosions . The premise is simple the characters from the first movie haunted by memories of Jack Frost take a vacation to a tropical island . new improved Jack comes after them now with essentially the powers of Hydro from Spider essentially he can turn from water to snow easily and quickly divide himself multiply himself and worst of all he's managed to grow an immunity to his only former weakness . What's sad about this movie is that the brain dead fans of the first Jack Frost simply HORRIBLE movie ca n't appreciate the change of tone for the sequel . Just as Alien was a horror film and Aliens was all about action Jack Frost was a weak attempt at gimmick horror and Jack Frost is a cleverly written parody of the gimmick horror genre . Most of the entertainment comes the live action actors who serve admirably . Particularly funny among them are Ray Tooney a caricature of a retired British Colonel from the early Christopher Allport an insane hilarious spin on his wooden performance from the first film and David Allen Brooks the once serious role of manners to new totally bizarre heights The lack of memorable quotes'' disturbs me . As a horror movie Jack Frost Revenge of The Mutant Killer Snowman rates a zero . But you have to understand IT'S NOT HORROR MOVIE .
5255_7.txt,1, My sisters and my cousin forced me to see this chick movie . Its not the kind of movie would prefer to see but it really was n't that bad . would n't want to see this movie but after watching it could n't say it was bad just not my kind of film . It was very accurate in acting out what woman really talk about and do in certain situations . As a guy was n't TOO amused by the jokes but man the women sure were . They related to the movie and yeah it was funny to see themselves on the big screen . OH EM GEE DO THAT TO HAHA'' I've never seen the original nor would care to . If you are a girl this is a must see but maybe girls would say this movie sucked probably . do n't see a year old going Wow remember going threw that when was No man would have this in there collection but ca n't say it was horrible so meh .
4327_9.txt,1, What's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season . Here is my forecast The hatch was indeed blown but somehow everybody inside survived . Buts lets see about that . The episode at the end with the tent is an observation team monitoring the tracking device installed on Desmonds boat by Penny . Now that the magnetic shield around the island was lifted the signal was picked up by the observation station and they are going to send a rescue mission . After the destruction of the hatch the island is not isolated any more and other ships are going to arrive The others are finally going to share their secret with us poor observers Was it actually confirmed that there are going to be seasons of LOST ? Cheers Mike
6193_10.txt,1, a scarily real drama there is n't another drama out there that has scared the crap out of me like this has the characters are not your typical Islamic terrorist you have a blonde haired blue eyed guy who is as dumb as he looks he is a converted Muslim . well respected business man who pretends to be Jewish and a Frenchman who has converted to Islam but has clearly taken the word of the Koran to a whole new level . The hero of the plot is Darwyn who is an undercover FBI agent who has infiltrated the terrorist cell and has to do all sorts of god awful things to prevent himself from being detected . The first episode is a small taste of what's to follow . Although it is about Islamic terrorists the drama has a unique way of pointing out that not all Muslims are extremists which is comforting to those concerned with racism considering half the terrorist cell are Islam converts it makes you think that maybe they are the ones to be afraid of . The most chilling drama I've ever seen . The reason its so chilling is cause you never know who your friends your husband or your neighbours really are . Terrorists can be anyone anywhere anytime .
733_7.txt,1, This film also known as do n't look in the basement'' is actually not bad . It is a little known film even to die hard horror fans but found this movie pretty entertaining . Do n't get me wrong it's certainly not without its problems but do think more people should give it a look . The story of a hot nurse going to work in a sanitarium is certainly an appealing one to me . thought the acting which seemed forced at first somehow got better as the film went along . It seems like the actors really got into their roles . There are some good colorful characters including a guy who thinks he's still a soldier one who thinks he's a judge an adult with a child's brain and an attractive girl who craves attention so bad she drops her clothes when any man gets near her . The title do n't look in the basement'' has about as much relevance to the story as the last house on the left'' has on that film . If you like movies with creepy characters in a mental ward like do check this out .
3010_7.txt,1, This one started excellently . The photography and audio are the best I've experienced in years months Especially the use of and colours in single sequences is astonishing . Also making Jennifer Lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself but I'm not sure what Singh wants to accomplish with that . Now for the minuses . The screenplay was awful . Lopez's part turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot . She seemed to star the movie only to sell herself and the pic . The three beds seemed just too obvious . The baptizing of the child Carl was a psychologically too underlined way to embark the motive which Carl under . And so on . Anyway the movie had great way of showing where Singh comes from . Why is it that the most talented directors seem to emerge from India nowadays ?
3745_10.txt,1, Before talk about the ending of this film will talk about the plot . Some dude named Gerald breaks his engagement to Kitty and runs off to Craven Castle in Scotland . After several months Kitty and her aunt venture off to Scottland . Arriving at Craven Castle Kitty finds that Gerald has aged and he has grown meaner . Gerald has certain rules for the castle rules have been the same for years Gerald does not want them to stay but Kitty insist on staying by making excuses . One night her aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall . It scares her so much that she faints and excuse they must stay longer . Kitty becomes more worried about Gerald after she tries to go in the maze but Gerald catches her and is even meaner to her . Kitty then sends for reinforcements she calls their doctor who is actually their friend and his wide . Then to make things not look suspicious they invite a couple other friends do n't really do anything Blah blah Kitty and her aunt end up in the maze where the most suspense of the story is . They somehow get separated and they try to find each other . But the aunt stumbles upon the creature . it is the moment we've all been waiting for what is the creature lurking in the shadows ? is a giant FROG ! OMG what is better than that ! After seeing the aunt the frog literally goes crazy and runs oops mean hops up the stairs to the top of the castle . The frog then leaps out an open window . We then go on a shot from the ground and see the frog gall towards us yeah this movie was in But you want to know what is funny is the frog that falls out the window is actually a toy because it is the size of the frog before it takes the leap . It is then revealed that this was all evolutions fault blah blah and Kitty and Gerald get married . Then the last shot of this masterpiece is of the grave of the frog in the maze the only place where he was ever really happy
1368_8.txt,1, Man ca n't believe the largely harsh and negative comments for this movie . Okay it sure ai n't no sophisticated work of cinematic art . But it is a good deal of entertainingly tacky fun . For starters the titular pumpkin supernatural killer dude has to be one of the single most laughably silly and unscary things to ever stumble in front of a camera he looks like something you would see in a fourth carnival spookhouse . Secondly the moderate gore is ridiculously fake and unconvincing with the definite highlight occurring when this annoying uptight ultra woman gets electrocuted by a toaster . Then there's the always welcome presence of the ever Linnea Quigley who's memorably introduced taking a nice long utterly gratuitous shower that goes on for two minutes . Amazingly we also have appearances by deceased schlock picture legends John Carradine as an evil warlock and Cameron Mitchell as a horror TV show host . Moreover scream queens Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith have fleeting cameos . Lead child actor Ryan Latshaw projects all the charm and acting ability of a moldy old tree stump . Pretty brunette Rachel Carter pops her top and bares her cute little breasts . The cruddy special effects are decidedly less than special . The score is suitably overwrought . Yet this film overall has a certain endearingly hokey appeal to it which in turn makes this honey a real delectably cheesy hoot to watch .
12428_7.txt,1, While driving in a highway to the wedding of his beloved Betty Adam Jungmann is surprised by his former schoolmate Harley Urich on the backseat of his car . Adam has broken off with the inconvenient and moron Harley because of Betty Along their road trip Harley makes fun of some rednecks in a bar and later their car is chased by a giant monster truck on the road . After some incidents they give a lift to the hitchhiker Sarah Brooks and sooner the trio is terrorized by a scary monster driving the monster truck . In spite of having one of the most annoying characters have ever seen in a horror movie the irritating Harley Monster Man'' is a surprisingly good trash horror The story is a collection of clich beginning like Joy Ride'' or Duel'' then it turns to one of the countless rip of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' there is a surprising twist ending with a hook for a sequel . There are hilarious scenes Aimee Brooks is extremely sexy and this film really entertains . My vote is seven . Title Monster Man''
10073_7.txt,1, So Madonna is n't Meryl Streep . Still this is one of her first films and a comedy at that . Give her a break ! Sure the movie is mediocre at best and pales in comparison to its earlier counterpart Katherine Hepburn Bringing Up Baby . For what it is though piece of fluff it's quite a bit of fun to watch . I've yet to hear anyone that slams Madonna's acting skills back it up evidence or even adjectives other than awful'' bad'' or other such vague descriptive words . If you wan na see bad acting or justify the argument that singers should stick to singing how about Whitney Houston ? She's had the most undeserved commercial success of any actress in history and could n't act her way out of a hatbox . The American public obviously can not discern the difference between a credible performance in a movie and star power . think Madonna has always been at least credible in her movies . Get real people . Madonna is so
4741_10.txt,1, After watching Waco The Rules of Engagement'' was just sitting in disbelief of what was witness to . big cover up by the FBI a massacre by gung happy government agents ? clearly remember the Waco standoff was years old at the time and watched it all on CNN . remembered reflecting about all the children as watched the Mount Camel compound burn in April remember feeling sorry for the children but clearly felt that it was the fault of their evil leader David Koresh and the other Davidians . Gazecki's film shows clearly and beyond doubt even though it is biased that the FBI lied over and over again . think that this film was a big contributor to the reopening of a new investigation of the incident in The outcome of this new investigation was in some sense predictable the judgement relied on fact that was just as grey as the facts that the Davidians presented . was very disappointed about the verdict because as far as know it did n't take into account all the lying misinformation and evidence cover by the FBI and other officials . Why have no one be prosecuted for hampering the work of the Texas Rangers investigators ? Why were they allowed to contaminate the crime scene and bulldoze the compound shortly after the incident ? These are questions that have n't been given answers to by the government . Most importantly what about the children ? In this new investigation have n't been informed about who was responsible for spraying the CS flammable tear into a compound with many hazards for igniting this gas and have n't found any answer to whether the children's muscles contracted due to the effects of the gas while they were alive . If they did would surely think that the Janet Reno or who ever was in charge of the raid should be indicted for mass or manslaughter . The question that was raised by Gazecki but not mentioned is Was is a direct plan for the people in charge and their tanks to cut holes and burn the building down with intent ? plan that would have been accomplished with efficacy or were the officials in charge so incompetent that their were unaware of the consequence of their actions ? Both are equally frightening . Even if the Davidians set fire to the compound the officials in charge surely provided them with the opportunity to do the job . If the officials in charge knew as they claimed that the Davidians would set fire to the compound why the did the tanks cut all the holes in the building making it into a furnace and why did n't they have plans to deal with the fire that they knew would occur ? Dark questions that still wo n't go away The final and most relevant issue of this film is the way that the Davidians are demonized by the government through the media who just feeds it in to the public . clearly remember the resentment felt for the evil Davidians that saw on CNN in Now that I'm older can see a clear line of communication coming out of the government every time they are gearing up for a massacre of civilians along with the intended targets . Demonizing people with words like they have different unlawful values then us'' they do n't enjoy freedom'' and they are a threat to our freedoms and way of life'' makes them so much easier to kill''
9635_8.txt,1, OK. film Segal's last few films once again goes beyond the knock down kick in the groin shoot in the face get revenge against the bad guys for hurting my sister's niece's cousin'' stuff Seagal was into for a while . Geepers Steven started thinking and using his bucks to make movies with actual ideas in them . SURE . is plenty of action in this flick but also some thought and heart . It's not an Oscar flick but well worth the effort unless the viewer is so into brain dead violence that it hurts to have to think for longer than a second . It's worth a rental . two !
3599_7.txt,1, Once you can get over Nic Cage playing an Italian soldier who loves opera and believes in making love not war you can get down to enjoying this beautiful film . This could be used as an advert for tourism in the Mediterranean . John Hurt is great and Penelope Cruz is n't bad as you might expect . Christian Bale's character is somewhat one which is a shame . The main drawback of this film is the adaptation from the book having been told subsequently the differences between the book and film plots feel cheated out of a much better and more convincing storyline .
11193_7.txt,1, Distant'' is a slice flick which follows the mundane activities of two adult male cousins one a photographer and the other an unemployed underachiever . There's little doubt that auteur Nuri Bilge Ceylan is a work in progress with considerable talent . However this little foreign minimalistic arty dramady is so full of empty filler and so devoid of story or anything engaging or provocative that it will likely appeal to only the most avid devotees of cinema and mainstream audiences should look elsewhere . personally grew quickly bored with the slow pace of the film and found myself fast through the empty spaces and there are many between dialogue plot development and denouement . Distant'' is a very nicely done bit of esoterica .

Disappointing resolution does not take away too much from rest of flick which shows an interesting slice of life .
8749_9.txt,1, Compared to the acclaimed Hollywood remake this film is less flashy but much stronger at providing an overall picture of the drug problem . The remake loses the most interesting of the three plot threads that of a farmer whose meager livelihood depends on drugs as a paying cash crop and whose increased involvement with the drug trade in an effort to better himself destroys himself and his family . Additionally the story of the daughter's addiction goes into the problems not only of withdrawal but the high likelihood of relapse . This original miniseries makes good use of the additional time to go into the issues more thoroughly and remains stronger meat on this controversial subject .
6247_10.txt,1, OK. have seen just about everything . some are considered classics that should n't be like all those Halloween movies that suck crap or even Steven king junk some are considered just OK that are really great . like carnival of souls then some are just plain ignored . evil ed or pumpkin head and brain dead the bud Cort one'' then some stick in your head once seen and never leave . what this did to me . for my money this is much better than last house on the left . house was great till the ending . it blew chunks . kind of dummy is gon na give a blow job to someone who just killed their kids stupid find the movie bully'' or even funny games'' if ya want realism and to be creep ed out . this damn thing stuck with me for years . cause chuck Connors always was scary . Tanya Roberts is the best female victim ever . the chick being smothered in plaster still is one of the all time worst killings on film . the telekinetic powers thing blew my mind and came totally unexpected . to mention the dummies wax figures puppets etc . should be right there with psycho house chainsaw it's a classic . deservedly so .
2330_10.txt,1, LCDR Tom Dodge despite having a reputation among submariners as a renegade and maverick to reader Maverick does not mean Tom Cruise'' Maverick means non is actually an intelligence operative for the Vice Admiral of his submarine fleet . The Vice is concerned about our old friends the Russians hosting yard sales with their old diesel fleets . Countries like Lybia North Korea or Iraq would love to get their hands on this baby and slip a nuclear warhead into Norfolk Harbour or Mayport Florida . And this was years before The Admiral assigns Dodge to assume command of a moth WWII diesel sub and mount an exercise against the surface fleet and the USS ORLANDO a top of the line fast attack sub . Dodge takes command and in no time whips up the bad news bears . err mean his lovable group of oddball submariners into warriors . Despite having welcome aboard'' tattooed on his penis he is a competent and fair commander he does not choose favorites and he delegates authority in a responsible manner . The US NAVY could not have come up with a finer piece of recruitment propaganda than this handsomely made under gem from the creator of Police Academy''
2313_8.txt,1, ca n't explain it but find this movie not only funny but so enjoyable feel compelled to watch it over and over or at least did when had cable TV . always felt it was a really poorly made movie but perhaps that is because watched it on cable . plan to get a DVD of this movie to really take an honest look at at but more importantly to just have a good time watching it . liked the plot and the idea of the movie and especially liked the cast . always wonder if the cast enjoyed making the movies they are in and this is no exception . This film deserved a better fate than it received and Kelsey Grammar deserved at least one love scene with Ms. Holly . Who would n't ? The characters in this movie were the kind of guys could identify with when was in the military and the zaniness was exact . Nice going troops .
10906_10.txt,1, Joan Cusack steals the show ! The premise is good the plot line interesting and the screenplay was OK. tad too simplistic in that a coming story of a gay man was so positive when it is usually not quite Then again it IS fiction . All in all an entertaining romp . One thing noticed was the inside aspect . Since the target probably was straight they may not get the gay stuff'' in context with the story . Kevin Kline showed a facet of his acting prowess that screenwriters sometimes do n't take in consideration when suggesting Kline for a part . This one hit the mark .
11453_7.txt,1, group of obnoxious teens go to a former funeral parlor for a Halloween party . They get trapped inside and become possessed by demons that they have accidentally awakened . The possessed teens start killing the others off and seem to be led by Angela Kinkade who floats and talks in a really deep voice . The remaining teens that have n't been possessed yet are forced to fight off the demons and try to escape the house . This is a pretty decent horror film with great special effects which include Linnea Quigley has a couple nude scenes as usual gouging out a guy's eyeballs and pushing a tube of lipstick into her nipple . There's also a scene where a couple has sex in a coffin and a guy getting his tongue bitten out . This is a great film to watch with a bunch of friends late at night while eating some pizza . The terrible acting and atrocious dialog almost ruins it though . Overall would give it a out of
5332_8.txt,1, Simply delightful claymation feature from Nick Park and company spoofing such film as King Kong'' and The Wolf Man'' has Wallace and Gromit as rabbit security finding it difficult to solve a major problem in their village . giant were is feasting lavishly on the vegetable crops of the citizens ! What makes this even worse is that the great vegetable festival is about to commence and the citizens have all prepared dutifully to win the top of prize . What makes the situation even worse is Wallace is the reason behind the whole vegetable rampage . was testing out a new invention regarding taking his brain waves in an attempt to brain wash captured rabbits into disliking vegetable crops . What occurs is catastrophic as some sort of hybrid were is created in the process . it has more to do with Wallace than he could ever imagine . It'll be up to his loyal startlingly intelligent fast dog Gromit to save the day . This is a clever and imaginative effort from the crew behind other Oscar winning claymation features starring Wallace and Gromit . Seeing good ole claymation is refreshing considering the CGI boom that has featured rather lackluster fare here recently as the industry spits out more and more mediocre product . Here we get a full feature with witty humor and some wild stunts featuring marvelous animation not to mention gut sight gags .
6495_8.txt,1, What do you mean son of actor not an actor . You do n't become an actor just because your daddy is a superstar does n't work that way not in UK at any rate . Macbeth version is a low budget Scottish movie . You ca n't compare this to the Polanski version because Polanski has all the budgets in the world . Jason acted throughout school but his big break came in when he landed the role of Robin Hood in Britain's Robin of Sherwood'' television series . He has appeared in many films since then including Shanghai Noon'' and Lord of the Rings Jason has since moved behind the camera forming the production company Unconditional Entertainment . He recently wrapped filming on his latest movie which stars Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ray Winstone . And all this has nothing to do with being the son of Sean Connery . If you think Jason said to Sean daddy wan na be in Macbeth movie that they are going to film and Sean said sure son whatever you say and made a phone call and got his son the role you are mistaken . In fact Jason Connery is being cut out of his father's will . Seeing as how his father is Sean Connery that's a big chunk of change Jason will be losing out on . The reasoning behind the decision is apparently Sean's strong feelings that his only son should learn to provide for himself . The relationship has become fairly strained with Jason even threatening to change his name . Of being the son of Sean Connery realize that I'm always going to be compared to my father . There are innuendos all the time . Should spend my whole life justifying myself ? So stop being a jackass and accuse him of not being able to act just because he is son of Sean Connery deal ! Watch Jason in Bullet to Beijing and you'll form a different opinion about his acting ability .
1935_7.txt,1, This is one of Barbara Stanwyck's earlier films and it sure does have an unconventional theme . She's making money by dancing with men at a dance hall . She really does n't like the work but it's a living . Her boyfriend seems like a pretty nice guy but she's also pursued by rich guy Ricardo Cortez . Well after marrying it turns out her nice guy'' is a thieving womanizing weasel and rich Cortez turns out to be a heck of a guy . By the end of the film Barbara simply has had enough as any SANE woman would walk from this horrid marriage . In the and early Hollywood did pretty much anything it wanted and some of their films had themes or scenes that would surprise many today as nudity adultery and bad language . While TEN CENTS DANCE is n't a blatant example of this morality it does have a theme that never would have been allowed after the toughened Production Code was created and enforced starting in In some ways the Code was great all parents did n't need to worry about what their kids saw in films as nudity in BEN HUR However it also tended to sanitize some of the movies far too much there is no way this particular film could have been made and approved because it tends to glorify divorce serious no and thereafter . This is really a shame as do n't think TEN CENTS DANCE was bad at all to discuss this since the star Stanwyck was married to a philandering thief . Even so allowing the film to end with her divorcing him and marrying a man who himself was twice divorced just could n't have been . Overall the film is interesting and thought Plus it was well and suited its relatively short run time . Give this one a look . FYI Ricardo Cortez was actually NOT Hispanic but changed his name because of possible prejudice because he was Jewish . He was an excellent leading man of his time but today is all but forgotten .

Things unravel and reravel and it's all joyous to watch . Jordan must have played bad guys in his career but he never played the same one twice this one is just too lovable to hate . Niven never played a slicker bad guy oil all over . Two fine actors we've lost that wish we had back .

2473_10.txt,1, ca n't believe missed this one . Made in with a budget that would probably allow you to make one indifferent episode of a TV soap this is minutes of sustained sharp as a knife film making . You will find the outline plot etc elsewhere on this site . though that the whole thing was shot using a single hand held camera . all the dialogue is improvised . none of the had appeared in front of a camera before . It sounds like a recipe for disaster . Instead what we get is hippies cops running around in the California desert in what evolves into a not fair . i'm on that person's side'scenario . The only problem is the director keeps making you shift your allegiance and at the end of minutes we're still not sure who has one . Brilliant . Quite brilliant .
2654_7.txt,1, Space Odyssey'' is set in and the main character is HAL . computer . That's right a computer who talks and thinks entirely on its own . This was made in and to think by it would be conceivable that computers would talk is a joke . If this was in a talking computer that had emotions and made its own decisions would be considered just as moronic as this . There is nothing in this film that provokes any kind of emotion . It provokes two reactions and one is called sleep . It starts with nothing but a pitch black shot for well over two minutes . Then the first shot we see that has some kind of lighting is The Dawn of Man'' sequence . So if it's in chronological order the blackness prior to this is the birth of the world ? During The Dawn of Man'' sequence out of no where a huge monolith comes from'' out of the ground from the sky we'll never know where it comes from but for one reason or another it's there . The monkeys go Apesh ! once they find this monolith that only man could have made but that's the catch'' man has n't evolved yet . So who made it and where did it come from ? What is its purpose ? The monkeys find a tool . The monkeys use bones to fight an opposing group of monkeys . The monkeys with the weapons are now the dominating group because they have used their mind to gain an advantage . The more advanced monkeys and more importantly smarter and more innovative monkeys are the dominate group as they have taken over the watering hole . We quickly jump into space millions of years later where we see a bunch of spaceships floating around to classical music . We can see the earth the moon the sun the universe and for a film made in the visual effects are stunning but outdated . The score is legendary . The cinematography is spectacular . The editing is atrocious . There are countless shots of boxy looking space ships floating in outer space for what feels like an infinite amount of time . Once we board the ship there is n't much to talk about . For the next hour Kubrick shows various shots of life in outer space . Kubrick shows us the life of an astronaut which is very boring and we completely get the message . The spaceships interior and exterior are bulky and outdated looking . Remember what the first cell phone looked like ? Me neither but that's what the future looks like in All the characters have clothes and hairdos that resemble The chairs are decorated in bright red colors and oddly shaped because we all know in the future we're going to be sitting in weird looking chairs . The computer screens are hideous looking and this is obviously prior to HDTV because the clarity is atrocious . All the TV sets look like they're from so it's not all that futuristic . Like all films set more than years in advance they look terrible and unconvincing . Just because this is Kubrick we should n't say Well that's how you would think it looks . No would n't . Just like would n't think a computer would be talking to me in the year It's not going to happen and if someone made a film right now set years in time and had a talking self thinking computer would laugh at the stupidity of it . Just like did with HAL is the liveliest person shoot'' just called him a person . HAL is a computer but he has more life than any of the muted characters in the film and he actually thinks he's alive . HAL is the only thing that's lively and he sees the humans as his maintenance men taking care of him while he does all the work . HAL reads'' the lips of one of the very few conversations between Dave and Frank and he sees'' that they are planning to turn him off . This is where the only dramatic part of the film enters An ensuing battle between a red light and a guy in a spaceship trying to get into the bigger spaceship . Oh the drama . Once HAL thinks he has the upper hand Dave makes his way back into the spaceship proving mans ingenuity . Dave proceeds to terminate HAL . HAL pleads for his life as he slowly fades away which like everything else seems to take forever . The final act is just as tedious as the first two . Once again the monolith that the Apes found appears at the end . It comes out of nowhere again . Then an infant is born in a placenta shield overlooking the earth from space . What is Kubrick saying ? Is it about transformation ? Dave to an infant ? Is man evolving again ? Is Kubrick saying this is the end of man and the start of'' whatever that alien looking thing is ? Maybe I'm going crazy trying figure out what this crazy director is trying to say but the more think about the more the beginning and the ending make sense . There are so many questions left unanswered especially for the purpose of the monolith . If you can make it through the film it should spark some thought . In the end the film struggles with getting to where it wants go . The first act and the third acts are strong but the second act meanders around hovering in one place for what seems like eternity . There is some intriguing stuff in the film that will provoke some thought if you give it a chance . Once the start of the film makes sense the ending works much better even if you still do n't what Kubrick is trying to say which do n't .
7956_10.txt,1, If you want to see a film with no guns blood sex shouting angry people hero bad guys girls or even clumsy love words and you want to see a film in which every shot has the meaning of LOVE'' this one is a must see film . For me I've been waiting for a film like this all of my life .
8082_7.txt,1, The film is a remake of a BBC serial called'My Friend Charles as such gallops thru the material in a relatively short time . found it fast moving unpretentious . anyone else notice the scenes the end John Mills was being gassed ? producers obviously decided to omit the scenes censorship ? notice when he's sat by the window of the flat breathing closely followed by similar scenes with the car window open . The Francis Durbridge serials all seemed to inhabit the same universe of unexplained happenings being not what they seem the villain being someone close to the hero predictable universe in some ways one with its own rules regulations .
2099_7.txt,1, Like another poster mentioned Ch . local Boston TV station showed this multiple times over the years on Saturday afternoons . They paired it with the first sequel Return of the Ginat Majin'' Now have n't seen it since then . it never left me . Aside from the atrocious dubbing and faded color this was a pretty good fantasy . Technically it is n't horror . the statue comes to life at the end . It's just about a village ruled over by an evil man . There's a giant stone statue there that the villagers keep praying to to help them . no avail . But things go too far the statute comes to life and destroys the bad guys . then it starts going after the good guys too ! Well with some cool special effects at the end how he got rid of the main bad guy Also there was an enchanted forest worked in which was kind of interesting too . No masterpiece but an unusual combo fantasy film . Worth catching not if it's the dubbed print .
9453_7.txt,1, The movie was great and everything but there were a lot of mistakes in the soccer'' scenes wonder if any of the guys who were working on the movie have ever seen a soccer match before . first of all do n't understand how she wanted to try for the boys team ? in soccer boys and girls cant play in the same team and these are the FIFA rules . And do n't get me started on who when they found out that she was actually a girl they let her continue to play . second of all players cant paint their faces with colours and play like that again FIFA rules not mine . and do n't get me started on the way they scored goals its was ridiculous completely unrealistic . and all the players seemed like they did n't know Jack about soccer . and when duke was training Viola why did they only concentrate on shooting what happened to passing and dribbling . or was shooting her only problem ? and why the hell were all the posters on the wall in their room were for players from Chelse do n't they like any other players from any other teams . it was like this was the only team they know . but other than that the movie was good and enjoyed the rest of it just the training and the game scenes were unrealistic for me . they really should have consulted some one a bout them .
1370_10.txt,1, Crazy Scottish warrior race stranded deep in outer low on food and budget free started ten now down to three who will help these men of pluck with visual effects that semi suck but kinda liked the freaky being if met one then I'd be fleeing but not if had Scottish mates we'd f'n swear and avoid that fate so in the end it was n't botched it was a DVD I'm glad watched but if they ever make a sequel dump some actors not all were equal some were good with gritty acting some were wooden and should maybe pack it in but the action kept me watching all the shooting shouting did n't stall I'll tell my friends not to fear and watch again in another year .
9877_8.txt,1, Halloween The producer's cut review ! Halloween starts of with a recap of the horrific ending to Part five . If you thought the last chapter was dark this one will really blow your mind . mysterious Man in Black'' has raided the Haddonfield Police Department freeing Micheal Myers . In the process poor Jamie Lloyd was abducted by strange cultists . What they want with her ? Who knows but let's just say her long suffering will end soon . Doctor Loomis is back spending the rest of his twilight years trying to stop Michael Myers from killing any more innocents luck friend of Loomis Doctor Wynn comes back after a four sequel hiatus to help the good doctor . Another old face from part one guest stars as well . This dark and dreary sequel was dismantled during the post production editing . For some reason the distributors felt that the final product was n't worth the average horror film watcher's time . So they decide to dumb it down . Then after having the film sit on the shelf for several months it laid an egg at the box office . No matter what they did to the film they made it worse . They should have left well enough alone . Hey the film company knows better than the filmmakers now . they ? Producer's Cut recommended Released version Not recommended
5259_7.txt,1, Mary Haines Ryan a rich woman discovers her husband is cheating on her with a younger woman Mendes She does n't know what to do and friends Sylvia Fowler Bening Edie Cohen Messing and Alex Fisher Pinkett Smith try to help . OK was no reason to redo the movie . That's a true classic and does n't need to be updated and redone . Naturally it WAS done . This has gotten some of the worst reviews I've ever seen for a motion picture . love the original and have seen it MANY times was constantly comparing it to that . Now this is n't a classic but it's not that bad . SPOILERS ! First the bad story is old and was updated . Really man cheating on his wife is hardly shocking today . Meg Ryan wonderful actress is pretty terrible here . Her face seems unable to change expression ! could n't believe how bad some of her scenes came over . Eva Mendes is bad too it's not entirely her fault . Her role is badly written and she has to compete with Joan Crawford from the original . Smith's character tough lesbian goes to pieces in an operating room . It IS funny . it's showing that a strong woman instantly goes to pieces when confronting an emergency . Also the script inserts some clumsy passages where Ryan talks to her daughter about being yourself . In those moments it seems more like a Lifetime movie than anything else . Now the good movie retains the originals decision to NEVER show a man on screen . This movie is about and for women are n't needed a man Bening is just great as Fowler she's on screen the movie makes a great leap . Also Smith is just wonderful does n't overplay underplay her lesbian character too much . Messing is good too but she's not in this much . Bette Midler is just hysterical in a small role and Cloris Leachman pulls off the nothing role of a housekeeper . The direction is good too during a fashion show sequence . heard director Diane English purportedly had a lot of trouble directing her first full movie but it does n't show in the final product . Also there are some clever references to the original certain lines that were inserted with no fuss . saw this in an audience full of women were a few guys but not many and they loved it . The movie ends on an operating room sequence that had everybody howling . So was n't needed but it's not the disaster people are saying it is . Also are saying we do n't need a movie with all women . Well not ? see plenty of movies with all guys in the cast and no one complains about that ! Ignore the complaints and bad reviews and see this . With a better performance by Ryan might have given this an or but as it is can only give it a
9383_7.txt,1, can honestly say that Death Bed The Bed That Eats'' was a much better movie than expected . Allow me to clarify the plot in case the title of the film is a little too vague there is a bed that eats . An evil bed . It eats people . Several unsuspecting women on an outing'' of some kind stumble across the sinister sack'' and ultimately fall prey to it's hunger . The bed's devouring process consists of a yellow foam soaking people into it's inner . stomach acid all complete with chewing sounds . This is a very strange cult flick and the only film from George Barry who had forgotten he made it until word of it's newfound cult status got back to him and he decided to release it on DVD . Not a bad movie at all if you can look past the lousy acting and enjoy the hokey effects the most laughable being the guy whose hands are eaten off and he is left with only plastic looking skeletal fingers . Pretty dreamlike tone to it too coming across as very surreal and aberrant mainly the whole thing involving the artist behind the painting and the demonic back story of the bed . If you like bizarre no oddball flicks than definitely seek out Death Bed''
3910_9.txt,1, I've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was in it as well did n't give Me the best impression of the film then to be dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sit there expecting a pile of pants was shocked to find that was scared stiff all the way through the film it was predictable yes but the build up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the film made it REALLY scary for me was watching through my fingers the whole way through . So say go watch it and decide for yourself and if the fact that its a scary film does n't convince you to go watch it then it also has Chad Michael Murray in it which ca n't be bad to watch for a couple of hours eh ?
12417_9.txt,1, Five minutes in started to feel how naff this was looking you've got a completely unheroic hero and his overweight fool of a friend . Seen it all before yeah right . was getting ready to be bored out of my mind for a good few hours . This is something have become quite used to . have n't we all . Then after a few minutes of testosterone fuelled insults and such the truck appeared . Okay the filming techniques used to make it look fast were clumsy but who cares ! That truck is amazing ! Soon however that is taken away again and we're back to the geek and his overweight friend . But now i'm satisfied that at least it wo n't be too terrible . then proceed to be amazed again and again by the cleverness of the film . There are so many jokes at their expense it's like everyone in the world is in on this except the two of them . The mind behind the makeup and effects was a genius swear it . Believe me if you are a man you miss so many of the jokes in this film there is so much here that only a girl can understand . Brother Bob is by far the best hillbilly killer that can be found anywhere the fact that he's sewn together just adds to the effect . There are of course some really dud science facts in here but is n't that always the case . When our is having a nose bleed and using the blood to lead brother Bob to his death now that is rubbish . There is no way a nose bleed can be that bad and not mean a severed artery or something . I'm all with the use of too much blood but that is taking it a little too far . The incest jokes are a little predictable but funny nonetheless . And the way brother bob meets his end is more than classic . Overall this movie rules it really breaks out of the overacted melodramatic strain of horror that we got so much of in The end of this move simply could not have been better . This is a definite must watch for anyone who likes their horror with several side orders of gore and attitude .
11274_8.txt,1, Anyone who correctly identifies the opening images as God killing himself without reading the end credits certainly deserves a free ticket to a rest home in Transylvania . would imagine this as being a favorite movie at Twin Peaks'' dark lodge on movie night if time existed there . would think that a better title might have been How much fun can you have with someone who's almost dead in the forest with only neolithic technology ? The answer it would seem is quite a bit . So despite the silly God Killing Himself the uber apt phrase taken from a previous letter the more clearly Alistair Crowley Hi I'm the Beast deal with it ! than Christian cosmology ca n't believe another viewer had the thick to see the Judeo Bible in this despite all of that . this is a daring important work that most people should not see . am both impressed and creeped out that it was made at all .
10938_7.txt,1, enjoyed this movie okay it just could have been so much better . was expecting more action than what got . was more of a comedy than anything else . Granted it was serious in parts and it had a good fight scene here and there for the most part it was more romance and comedy with some action and no horror at all . Which is hard to do with a vampire movie . vampire hunter loses his partner and must train another his sister is going through a difficult break up but she is being pursued by a vampire of all things . Granted this vampire is rather nice and not into sucking blood . So that is all there is really to it except for a plot of another vampire after certain royal vampires so he can gain ultimate power . Some of the problems with this movie is that its plot went here and there and the movie had a very uneven flow to it that and it seemed to shift genres a bit much too . One minute action the next pure comedy . However the girls were cute there is good action the comedy was worthy of a chuckle or two and Jackie Chan makes a rather energetic appearance or two . This movie probably just needed more development in some areas such as the villain who is basically not really explored at all . So for a movie with a few good fights and a chuckle or two this is rather good . why was it rated have seen stuff we have made that is PG that is a lot worse than this .
3491_7.txt,1, No real plot no character development no Scorcese direction but seriously were you really expecting any of this ? The only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious nearly on the same level as Borat . Sure the ending drags a bit but if Borat's cameo did n't crack you up you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys . Sacha Baron Cohen is possibly the greatest comedian ALIVE and here he gets more laughs than Jude Law on a nude beach . dare you not to laugh . If you can pull the ten pole out of your behind for an hour and a half and just enjoy some well timed and extremely stupid jokes in a stupid story about a stupid character see this stupid movie . You'll be glad you did . Keep it real !
6626_7.txt,1, It came as no surprise to me that this was a very depressing and draining movie . After all it's all about the impact of war on civilians AND it's by the king of depression'' Ingmar Bergman . In other words so many of Bergman's works delve deep into human misery and angst and so this movie seems not so extraordinary coming from this director . Even though it is more difficult to watch the last half of the movie offers perhaps more insight into the lower depths of humanity . That's because initially the main characters Ullman and Max Von Sydow try to overcome adversity and are basically decent a bit stupid people . However as deprivation after deprivation occurs they Von Sydow become less and less humane and more animalistic ANYTHING in order to survive . Fun to watch NO FREAKING WAY ! But an interesting insight into human nature . PS thing LOVED about this film is that it avoided a stupid movie chiche . When the couple sat down with the shopkeeper to drink a glass or wine they FINISHED the wine completely ! In most movies they barely touch their drinks or leave them untouched . It drives me crazy as would NEVER leave a alcoholic beverage without drinking it unless it tasted terrible or had a bug floating in it ! BRAVO !
11444_8.txt,1, saw Night of the Demons first before saw Night of the Demons'' Unfortunately my old Blockbuster thought it was a good idea to have the sequel but no first one . Looney huh ? Now think all horror fans need this movie . It's like McDonald's you know it's bad for you and you'd rather have The Cheesecake Facotory whatever pricier restaurant you prefer but you ca n't help but just wanting the cheap stuff . Night of the Demons has it all your innocent sexy goes by the rules chicka your token black guy that surprisingly does n't get killed . You're slutty girl you're slutty guy you're dark girl or guy the goof ball the cheesy settings of a haunted house bad acting and lots of unnecessary nudity . Is n't this stuff great ? mean know deep down in my heart of movies that this was pretty bad but it was a good bad for horror movies . Horror fans should enjoy and dig in !
695_10.txt,1, This movie is all about reality submarine warfare in WW was not a clean precise science . There were no computers giving exact enemy details there was no precise instrumentation to control the sub . Not all the crew went to fight with a song in their heart and a smile on their dial . People with expectations of seeing a pretty war'' in this movie will be grossly disappointed GOOD they deserve to be disappointed they deserve to have reality shoved into their face . War is not clean exact fought by people about to break into song . It is endured by scared cold hungry desperate people willing to do anything to survive . We Dive at Dawn'' is a fine example portraying a desperate situation needing desperate actions .
10066_7.txt,1, Madonna gets into action again and she fails again ! Who's That Girl was released just one year after the huge flop of Shangai Surprise and two after the successful cult movie Desperately seeking Susan . She chose to act in it to forget the flop of the previous movie not suspecting that this latter could be a flop too . The movie received a bad acceptance by American critic and audience while in Europe it was a success . Madonna states that Some people do n't want that she's successful both as a pop star and a movie The soundtrack album in which she sings four tracks sells well and the title single was agreat hit all over the world as like as the World Tour . The truth isthat Madonna failed as an actress the script was quite weak . Butit's not so bad especially for those who like the it's such a ramshackle trash colorful and joyful action movie At the end it's very funny to watch it .
7650_8.txt,1, This would definitely not have been my kind of movie but my husband saw it on TV and said it was really good . So on his recommendation bought a copy since did n't know if it would ever be on TV again . had never heard of anybody in it except Armand Assante . At first had a hard time getting into the story because the first part of the movie is a jumble of images and it does n't make much sense . It is only later in the movie that it all comes together . The scene if that's what it's called is a bit jarring it sometimes looks as if a few frames have been cut out of each scene and the scenes are jerky guess that was done to add to the unusualness that's a word The story veers here and there and just about the time you have it all figured out everything turns upside down and you have to readjust your thinking as to who is the bad guy and who is not . Or bad woman . The acting is very good kept thinking how much Norman Reedus looks like Leo Decaprio . The ending was a real twist totally unexpected which liked . good show .
2414_7.txt,1, first viewed this film shortly after it was put out on video in dismissed it offhand saying that Julie was no Daniel never really giving it a chance and saying it was horrid . But here it is years later its on Disney and im watching it again . And I'm finding that it isnt as bad as made it out to be . Miyagi is still Miyagi just as kool as ever the musical score is still there pleasant as ever . And Swank's character isnt that bad her acting is pretty good considering the script . It beats the third installment by a wide margin . So my original rating of has been raised to
6986_8.txt,1, It opens with your cliche overly long ship flying through space . All could think at this point was Spaceballs'' and hoping there'd be a sticker on back that said We break for Nobody . The movie then shows some cryogenic freezers with Vin Diesel's narration . I've always thought his voice sounded cool ever since saw Fast and the Furious . From when found out he was as criminal thought the movie was going to be cliche . It was . It was very cliche and fate seemed to be against them at every turn . Black out every years . Lucky them they land on that day . Aliens can only be in the darkness hey it's a solar eclipse . As much as thought it was too easy and just a cliche the movie pulled through and kicked major even went out and bought a copy of Pitch Black after seeing it . really ca n't wait for Chronicles of Riddick .
1983_9.txt,1, eXistenZ combines director David Cronenberg's traditional love of blood and gore and exploding heads with the more confusing aspects of a reality twisting David Lynch film . And it actually works effectively . wo n't bother trying to give even the bare bones of a plot synopsis here because it'll only cause more confusion . All you need to know is that the film is about a virtual reality computer game that is so incredibly lifelike that it becomes difficult to tell the difference between reality and virtual reality . The film almost seems to abandon its technology fearing point at the end but then it throws in the final twist in the very last line of dialogue . There's also some very gross sexual imagery based around the in the protagonists backs as well as some very gross acting from Jude Law . He manages to come off as naive and stupid and boring and any other annoying habit you can care to think of . Jason Jennifer Leigh comes off much better and everyone else can be called a supporting character including Willem Dafoe in a functional if unspectacular role as a money mechanic . Overall eXistenZ is a very effective sci film about the possibilities technology can present and the possible consequences it will receive .
6239_8.txt,1, Despite a silly premise plot devices and low budget Trap manages to be striking . An inventive scored film must see . You have to throw rationality out the window to fully appreciate what the director was trying to do If you can manage that will be in for a pleasant surprise . Also take note that this is one of the few semi horror films that was n't spoiled by numerous sequels .
1511_9.txt,1, Cat In The Brain'' is a series of extremely violent sequences knitted together by a plot that feels more like an overview describing director Lucio Fulci's most notorious years of film The movie could also be seen as a dark comedy of sorts effectively spoofing the various claims that violent cinema causes violence in real life . Fulci goes further than that he casts himself as the star the central figure of the film thus showing the audience who is the man behind all the cinematic gore . Cat in The Brain'' is not about presenting a clear story and following it . Instead it pokes fun at some of the clich that have been surrounding the horror genre for years . Lucio Fulci plays himself as a horror director struggling to keep his humanity intact . Years of violent film making have finally began to reach him . It starts slowly steaks and meat in general begin to disgust him his colleagues assure Fulci that all he needs is some rest . But that does n't help and soon the grotesque ideas for his movies begin to overwhelm his daily thoughts . In an attempt to find a cure for his dangerously maddening mental state Lucio starts going to the local psychiatrist . Unfortunately that does more wrong than good and Fulci is thrown into an even bigger mess as the psychiatrist turns out to be a psychopath who mimics the murders from Fulci's films in real life . The film retains all the trademarks of Italian splatter cinema good or bad they are all here . So any comments about the acting or the technical aspects and budget constrains are quite irrelevant as to the quality of the film . It is a visual experience no doubts about it . Fulci throws in an incredible amount of violence easily surpassing pretty much everything he's made . Amputated by chainsaw limbs cannibalism child murder decapitation these are just some of the many grotesque acts witnessed in Cat In The Brain'' Some of them are obviously recycled from a few the director's less profile movies but they do n't stand out of the context and actually feel quite at home here . As noted before the movie exists much better as a satire of the genre rather than a serious piece . The way some of the violence is presented does help establish that idea . Such sequences shortly after climax are rejected by the reality in the film as they are revealed to be actually scenes inside a movie that Fulci's character is directing . This sort of film in film'' presentation lessens somewhat the impact of the gore . But in no way does it make it an easy to watch film . Oh no this is far beyond and above the levels of gore found in mainstream horror and gorehounds will in no doubt be satisfied with that fact . Lucio Fulci was a very polarized figure . People either hate his work or love it . Cat in the Brain'' wo n't convince any of Fulci's detractors in the opposite but it is nevertheless an interesting part of his filmography . One that fans should really check out .
6930_7.txt,1, To surmise this film involves two actors and Moran trying to con a gangster . The plot is flimsy at best as several plot holes occur throughout . However this normally should n't matter as the comedy should carry a film like this . There are some genuinely funny bits provided by Dylan Moran However other times there are long melodramatic scenes that fail to add anything to the movie . Caine's character seemed overdone to me . Especially at the start he continually quotes Shakespeare and acts like a pompous actor . One could say he was playing the part properly but the character seemed to me flat and unfunny . Overall would say see only if a fan of the actors involved . Otherwise wait for video or tv .
2160_7.txt,1, Night Hunter starts in as a young Jack Cutter Aguilar is unexpectedly handed the family tradition of becoming a Vampire hunter when a fellow Vampire hunter Sid O'Mack Haim betrays his family hands them over to the Vampire's to aid Jack on his quest he is given a book that contains the name of every Vampire alive or dead whichever way you look at it . Jump to Los Angeles where the now adult Cutter Dragon Wilson also credited as co has but four names left in the book including Argento Murdocco Carmella Crawford together they are the last of the American Vampires . As they all dine in a restaurant Cutter crashes the party kills them job done right ? Wrong as King of the Vampires Bruno Fischer Guest calls in the last four remaining Vampires from around the world the French Tournier Ford the Asian Hashimoto Yuan Ulmer Fralick Sangster Klyn to track Cutter down kill him . Meanwhile Detective's Hooper Aurelius Browning Casey do n't have a clue a nosey reporter named Raimy Baker Smith becomes involved in the battle between Cutter the Vampire's on which the very fate of Earth rests ! Directed by Rick Jacobson thought Night Hunter was quite a fun way to pass odd minutes . The script by William Martell mixes martial arts horror with a fair degree of success it moves along at a nice pace is at least never boring thankfully does n't seem to take itself too seriously . The character names that reference other horror film director's are a little tacky though . Some may be surprised at how closely Night Hunter resembles Blade yet was made a couple of years prior the lone moody long coat wearing Vampire hunter who happens to be an expert in martial arts the scene set in a nightclub the innocent woman drawn into the world of Vampire's . Night Hunter does n't really stick to traditional Vampire film law for instance sunlight only irritates their eye's they can only breed on a solar eclipse stakes through the heart garlic is no good as the way to kill a Vampire in Night Hunter is to break it's neck . could have done with a bit more horror a bit more blood as it leans more towards the martial arts side of things . The dialogue is suitably cheesy the character's are just about likable enough in a silly way . Director Jacobson does his best to ruin the film the actions scenes are OK but lack a certain something for some bizarre reason whenever an action sequence takes place he shakes his camera constantly it's like the camera is placed upon a washing machine full cycle ! Hey Rick mate it's not clever or stylish it's irritating annoying . The gore is disappointing with a few gory gunshot wounds a few splashes of blood breaking Vampire's necks do n't involve much blood unfortunately . With a budget that probably did n't amount to much Night Hunter is competently made throughout . The acting was bad most of the time what's with Dragon thing in Don Dragon Wilson's name ? Has he legally changed his name ? Does he sign cheques Don Dragon Wilson ? Does he get mail addressed to him in that name ? think might do something like this from now on want to be known as Paul Killer Klown Andrews . Night Hunter is one of those crap films that transcends it's limitations awfulness to become pure golden entertainment . If you like your films fun then Night Hunter might be for you if your looking for big thrills in a similar vein Vampire's veins blood get it ? then Blade it's sequels would probably be a better choice . What the hell liked it so sue me .
7704_10.txt,1, watch this film with horror in my heart because my mother also was a crack head like Michelle . i've been wondering where Michelle is now . there has been times where had to find my mother in places was scared to be but more scared to leave her there ! to see Michelle act like that made me wonder where she was sleeping all that time ? watched in hopes the it was never that bad for my mom ! and what want to know is . where did Matt and Tracy tear that ass up'' worst scene for me was watching Tracy shoot up in an old navy dressing room ! never who try clothes on before you and it looks like all of them except Michelle has aids ! where are they know can we get an update ?
12240_10.txt,1, was completely drawn into the story but wonder if perhaps should n't have been so sympathetic to the Hurt character's plight for respect . Because when it boils down really think that glam reporters such as Barbara Walters is the devil . maybe the filmmakers were telling us that we're all unknowing supporters of fluff news stories .
8873_10.txt,1, In a really neat spin on Hitchcock Larry Crystal and Owen DeVito lead unpleasant lives Larry's ex has gotten rich by publishing a book that he wrote and Owen has the most overbearing mother imaginable . When Larry tells Owen to calm down by watching Strangers on a Train'' Owen gets the idea that they should do criss murders like in the movie . And just like in the movie Larry thinks that it's a joke but Owen's serious . How they came up with the idea for Throw Momma from the Train'' I'll never know but it's a hilarious movie . There is n't a dull moment in it . And that ending was a hoot . Crystal and DeVito are at their best and Anne Ramsey is as much of a hag here as she was in The Goonies'' modern classic .
10599_8.txt,1, saw this movie with hopes of a good laugh but when watched it did n't stop laughing for weeks they are such bad actors and it made this movie so much funnier to watch . BTW Ryan Dunn did n't eat the toy car he shoved it up his ass The random appearances from the skaters and Vitos parts were great . Gim me some grapes Vito . No Valo your grapes are at the store . would n't recommend any one under to watch it frankly they would n't understand half of the jokes in or what they are talking about . love VLB and after watching this movie could n't help but go buy it or the Viva La Bam series . What is the deal with this stupid comment thing ? It has to be lines what kind of Bull is that ? should be able to write one as long or in this case as short as want . I'm just going to keep typing until it tells me can actually send it . Its just a waste of time expected to just say what wanted it was n't too much but then I'm told have to keep putting more in and then it corrects my spelling so what if did n't spell something right you get what mean still . This is ridiculously long . who live by the Sword get shot by those who do n't
7442_7.txt,1, This movie was definitely scripted with FF VII fans ONLY in mind . am someone who has never played the original game and watched it with a friend who was a series fan . From a visual and technical standpoint this movie is just as good as The Spirits Within'' if not better but from a story standpoint was pretty lost . One major plot weakness that stood out to me was the scene where all'' of the children dying of geostigma were brought to the healing reunion'' by the three Jenovites . All told there were about kids in all . Hmmmm . thought that this Geostigma was an illness of pandemic proportions . understand why they did it that way budget but it just seemed cheesy after all the explanation about how the bad guys needed to collect all of those who had Jenova cells so that Jenova could be reincarnated . The subtitle version that we had fan sub from the internet was a pretty direct translation and therefore probably added to my confusion . It did prick my interest in FF VII however and spent a few hours on the FF VII wiki reading about the main characters and the plot . Once read the Advent Children wiki things made a lot more sense . If you are a video game or Sci fan this movie is a pretty good flick but like a previous review said it comes off like a minute fight scene . You never really get to know any of the characters and the story does just seem to jump from scene to scene without much explanation even though some explanation just might be required . Thank goodness for wikpedia .
11882_10.txt,1, This movie would had worked much better if this was the first Critters movie this is a low movie with only two Critters shown on Why this looks like a fail is because this is the last Critters movie and it's so low that it seems the director made the whole movie with his own pocket money . However did like this movie compare it mostly with the third movie were bad Critters have a more serious tone in it the first half of the movie without seeing one Critter yet you have a scary feeling watching it too bad they did n't milk'' out the Critters mean even if they only had two puppets they could still have used them on a lot more . The Critters also have different deaths in this movie which made this a little special especially at the end with the frozen Critter . Ug has a promotion in this part and is different in this movie which took me by surprise . Lastly liked this one because it also has some kind of conclusion to the series so at least we wo n't see a Critters anymore . Oh one last thing missed one scene in this movie we never see a Critter shoot a spike from its back maybe these puppets did n't have that feature but was very disappointed not seeing that Critters we see a lot of spike shooting which was the only good thing liked about that movie
4635_10.txt,1, There is no denying that this is a bad movie . The acting is n't great likewise the script acting and direction . Still can not wait until its video release from Anchor Bay . Everyone knows there are several bad movies out there that have a tremendous appeal to them . This one tops my list .
8_9.txt,1, I'm a Petty Officer Class and have been in the USCG for years and feel that this movie strongly represents the Coast Guard . There were only a few scenes that were far fetched . The most far was when PO Fischer went down inside of the sinking vessel to pull the vessel's captain out of the engine room . that would never happen . Swimmers are not allowed to go inside of any vessel no matter the circumstances . Second the Command Center in Kodiak it looked more like a NASA command center . we do n't have any gear that hi Third the Captain of the Airstation would not be running the search rescue cases with like people on watch . In reality it would be an or as the SAR Controller and maybe other support personnel like an assist SAR Controller a Radio Watchstander . Otherwise the movie was dead on think they should have incorporated more of the other rates in the CG and their roles in search rescue instead of just Aviation based rates . Some of the scenes from school reminded me of my days their and the dumb stuff did and got in trouble for in my younger days .
1570_8.txt,1, It's a sad state in corporate Hollywood when a movie surprises you by not taking routes you've been seeing in the movie house since day one . had literally no idea how this film was going to end because it went left when expected it to go right zigged when expected a zag etc . This could have easily unraveled into generic suspense thriller or depressing white trash drama but it stayed a course all its own till the end . It is a sad story though . Not because of what happens to Alice but because of the sad world that surrounds her and leads her down this path . The plot has a quiet dignity of form that's usually reserved for theater but the pacing could use some tightening up . Either way it's a very good film and for some reason suspect sour grapes from those who have scored this one low .
3418_8.txt,1, normally do n't like surprises ! Watch this movie by chance in a motel in South Africa second week of a three month motorbiking holiday in ZA . Apart from being well shot and acted it helped me in understanding the countries problems tremendously . Just watched the Million Dollar Baby'' and had to look up Hillary Swank since the name sounded somewhat familiar and her acting was superb . Did n't realise she was the solicitor in the Red Dust'' Well now i'm not to worried that she will disappear as so many other sidekicks of Clint before . Now am being asked to write ten whole lines of comment which is rather ridiculous for have written what wanted to write . OK here it goes think if you are from a western country especially Europe watching will help you to understand a little better why what is happening is happening down there ! So this hopefully will fill ten lines .
1618_10.txt,1, OK am a sucker . loved it . had no expectations and had them all fulfilled . It was a terrible movie . loved it . have managed to wear out a DVD from over use . No one can understand my obsession . ca n't either to tell the truth . For those who have seen the movie this will come as no surprise but asked the clerk at the video store if could buy a copy and could because there were two in stock and only one had been check out and over half of the time it had been to me . Now the movie is terrible . The special effects are terrible . The acting is terrible but loved it . The actors are silly the plot silly the goofs numerous being able to see through the monsters The arachnids'' looked like they were made out of plastic garbage bags they were There was light underground TNT was n't deafening etc . You must really love to get any enjoyment out of this . helps enormously for others .
9064_7.txt,1, This film was original in an unoriginal way . Although many movies have tackled the subject of suicide and mental institutions it was always about treating the patients and making them better because of the doctor's assistance in this film however we follow a depressed guy who falls in love with a suicidal girl and will stop at nothing to make her happy even though she does n't care for happiness at all she just wants to die . This was a very interestingly cute romance comedy that in nothing less than enjoyable . This is a fun one to check out if you ever get the chance you just have to be open minded about the material . Overall give it a just voted to get the rating higher
719_7.txt,1, To summerize this movie nice for TV but too small for the theatre . enjoyed watching this movie at home but wont watch it a second time . The concept is good but what ends up in the movie is just a summary . The end had a twist but is still unsatisfying . Maybe it was the intention of the director but it was n't worked out like a it should be . But then again it's an OK kind of movie .
7335_10.txt,1, Wow what can say it was a good movie very different to all the boring remakes we see lately the only thing would have liked to see a bit more of an ending like when Jane left her husband Im guessing she was going to Serena cause she fell for her just her but everything that she is so wish Producers would actually show that sort of ending instead of leaving to it your imagination sort of ending really hate it when they do that . The aerial acts looked like fun but guess you'd have to be light and muscly would like to see more movies like this one maybe the could do a sort of sequel of Jane and Serena . were in Jane's shoes would have went for the girl too she was attractive .
12020_10.txt,1, think that just sums up this film . Watch it and you'll find out why . The acting of the lead character John Keem is really really bad and he has no on screen charisma whatsoever . It's very funny because of this thought as is the ending where Keem beheads the bad guy despite the fact he is unarmed and has surrendered . Brilliant !
8829_8.txt,1, let's suspend belief for a moment and let's stop pretending we could might or ought know how it is'' or ought to be'' there in space . Human knowledge in that area is probably primitive as say middle ages maps are compared to today's satellite maps so we really have no clue . considering this is just'' a BBC TV docu it gets much better than many big budget Hollywood blockbusters and that is just incredible . all in all a show worth watching as it portrays the CGI enhanced and fictionalized account of what we know of the solar system this far . probably fictionalizing and CGI the whole thing is the only way to make it palatable to a large public . Ever watched clips from REAL space missions and REAL space probes ? The quality is generally average to poor and the comparison would be between looking at a chest what it tells about the human body and compare it with a CGI cyborg movie . one would be most entertaining ? Yet the chest is real while the cyborg flick is just fictionalized SFX . actors do a good job . None i'll tell my grandchildren about but very fair for it being a BBC docu
1383_10.txt,1, WOW ! Talk about a film that divides the audience ! This is a real love it or loath it kinda movie . Personally really enjoyed it . noticed that other reviews are comparing it to Pitch Black this is kinda dumb as the only thing they have in common is SAND ! People can be real stupid . No this film is far more in common with The Thing people fail to notice is amazing they even have the same basic music Lots of Carpenter touches are there blue collar heroes sharp humor endless rolling landscapes full of death and things not understood . Perhaps what stops this film being a real classic is it's deference to other Carpenter works . Not least Dark Star which it has something in common with . I'd be interested to know how much it REALLY cost ? Is that even possible ? Maybe it was based on a short film that cost But did find myself strangely moved when the various space dudes died . They are so underplayed that it's like watching a documentary at times . Having said that the script is kinda clunky and only about half of them can act however and I'm not sure the big guy playing the Captain is one of them . But his gun is AWESOME ! Give it a chance if you like early Carpenter you might fall for it just do n't expect
4524_8.txt,1, taking into consideration the Chan films that would follow this is n't bad . Plenty of stereotypes beginning with the Black man in the beginning and when the police captain orders that every Hindu in town'' by rounded parade of stereotypical characters enter the scene including Shemp of the Three Stooges . Charlie seems to move quickly around the city going from Sutton Pl . to the Village in a flash . ending is silly . An obvious toy airplane is used as it climbs through the sky and then nose dives . Ed Wood could n't have done it better . The final scene is absurd as the murderer will obviously incriminate himself in his attempt to quiet the one person who knows his identity . Overall it is worth watching .
162_8.txt,1, Three children are born at the exact same time a lunar eclipse . before their birthday they embark on a killing spree . Birthday'' is a typical slasher from early a pretty average stuff with plenty of nudity . evil children never generate any menace and there is almost no suspense . is also no gore or scares in Bloody Birthday'' the film is mildly entertaining . no real explanation is provided for the kids sudden homicidal mania . murder scenes are quite gruesome for example we've got death by handgun bat rope and shovel . if you're a fan of early slasher movies give this one a look .
2479_9.txt,1, As far as fake documentaries go anyone ? this one is up there with the best ! It looks very real and that is what it aims for . In recent light of events this movie is even scarier so you could say it was ahead of it's time when it was released in the One can only hope that a government like that does n't exist ! Looking for terrorists and interviewing people just like that ? Of course the people interviewed all seemed to have the same mentality Screw the politicians and politics in general . Maybe that was n't so clever one might think but hey do n't forget It's only a movie !
10942_7.txt,1, Fun mix of vampires and martial arts is a bit of a mess plot and the acting of those who dubbed the voices is almost universally bad but the premise is engaging the fight scenes are fast and flashy and the movie is often quite amusing . It's a shame the story is such a wreck . There are a couple of places where had no idea what just happened it was almost as though five minutes had just been cut out and you were suddenly at the next scene without knowing how you'd got there . The movie is poor at explaining things and some things do n't make a lot of sense but the movie moves along breezily so its flaws barely register . Not a great movie by any means but definitely a fun one .
4856_8.txt,1, Others main criticism of this film that Macy suddenly looks Jewish upon donning his glasses misplaced . The glasses are just the little bit of change needed to CONVINCE others he's a Jew . The scene in which he says to his boss but you KNOW what my background is along with another discussion with his mother suggests that he's had to fight this same assumption in the past . The glasses now make him look just Jewish enough to confirm'' his neighbors and co existing suspicions . Then there is his new wife's large nose and taste for loud clothes which OF COURSE means she's Jewish . The whole point of the film is how those little stereotypical nothings become the entire basis for judging others . If he has a lisp he must be gay . If he has long hair he smokes dope . If he's Hispanic he's got a knife . if he has round black glasses and he's slight of build he must be Jewish . Those statements all sound equally to me . If the conclusion people were jumping to in Focus was reasonable the whole point of the story would be lost .
11971_8.txt,1, Bears about as much resemblance to Dean Koontz's novel as Jessica Simpson does to a rocket scientist . If you've read the book suggest you put it as far out of your mind as possible before watching the movie . Watchers is your typical Boy meets dog dog turns out to be super government lab experiment dog and boy are pursued by super and emotionally disturbed monster created by same lab and oh yeah did mention the shady government agents pursuing the monster pursuing the dog ? movie . Corey Haim is the boy Barbara Williams is his mother Michael Ironside is one of the evil government guys and Sandy the dog is well the dog Furface here Einstein in the book The monster effects are ridiculously cheesy much of the dialogue is laughable the script rarely makes sense or is believable a good example is Haim's character's unquestioning acceptance of the dog's intelligence as if every Fido off the street can type messages on a computer keyboard or bark once for yes and twice for no ! Hmm it's got ta be the puppy chow right ? Haim's performance is enthusiastic but shaky as he carries off the stupid dialogue with the least amount of skill . Ironside has been the highlight of many a bad movie and this is no exception . He easily gives the best performance of the movie although I'm compelled to add that the dog a pretty darn good actor himself ! comes in a close second . All in all an atrociously dumb movie and yet And yet watched it three times within a week . And yet ca n't help liking it . Hey what can say have a taste for junk and Michael Ironside that I've ever actually tasted Michael Ironside I'm sure there are laws against that But any movie that can make me laugh that hard even unintentionally ca n't be all bad . Chalk it up to a guilty pleasure a yes know it's insultingly stupid but like it anyway'' movie . It's tough for me to rate this . On a normal scale I'm forced to give it a but on my own personal cheese scale it gets bumped up to an Yeah know . I'm weird like that .
1885_8.txt,1, Ah classic comedy . At the point in the movie where brains get messed together a two minute scene with Bruce Campbell beating himself up partially reminds me of how simplistic movies and ideas can grab you and wrap you into a whole movie . For years and years Bruce Campbell knows what kind of movies we want out of him . We want to see weird movies like Bubba Ho Tep . We want to see cameo roles in Sam Raimi movies and we want to see with the Screaming Brain With the title alone one knows that it's going to border that completely silly type of movie like Army of Darkness only with more silly and less monsters . The idea of the movie is simple . Bruce sees doctor . Doctor has new idea . Bruce gets bad things happen to him on way to see doctor . Coincidentally it's the thing the doctor wanted to show him that saves him . Hilarity ensues . With the addition of Ted Raimi as a weird Russian guy and journeyman Stacy Keach as Dr. Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov it's funny that does this movie . Complete funny . Never a point of scary . If you like the silly Bruce Campbell you'll like this . Then again why would you be watching this if you did n't like Bruce Campbell ?
4559_10.txt,1, As it turns out Chris Farley and David Spade only made three movies together Tommy Boy'' and Black Sheep'' but this was truly the Citizen Kane'' of their pairings . Farley plays Thomas Callahan III the dimwitted heir to an auto parts company . His father Big Tom Dennehy hires mild Richard Hayden Spade to look after him . Big Tom is getting married to a ten'' Derek so everything has to be in order . After Big Tom suddenly dies Tommy and Richard have to try to sell half a million auto parts to save the company from bankruptcy . From then on the movie is pretty much an excuse for Chris Farley to do what he does best make a mess of everything . When this movie first came out in the theaters saw it with my grandfather . He figured out early on that the Bo Derek and Rob Lowe characters were hiding something . But you can completely ignore that and simply luxuriate in Chris Farley's antics . Nothing is safe around his stomach and hell hath no fury like his happy attitude . The scene where he sets the cars on fire and later the deer scene make for a pure laugh riot . Chris Farley and David Spade were truly the John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd of their era . It's a pleasure to always be able to think about Fat guy in a little coat'' time and again .
4282_7.txt,1, gave it a seven only because the acting is good . And of course by that mean Wilkinson . The other two principals were decent'' But the characters themselves . on earth was so bad about the character Wilkinson played Manning did n't see him behaving like the martinet Emily Watson accused him of being . Bill Bule on the other hand was an insufferable jerk who was praying would meet an extremely brutal and prolonged demise . Who was kidding ? Tom Wilkinson is n't Paul Bettany after all . So what on EARTH did Emily Watson's character SEE in him ? She herself admitted he was pretty much a piece of offal in his treatment of her . Why would she even want to be in the same TOWN as him to say nothing of the same room'' noticed some other reviews one person said she cried'' at the end to witness James tragedy . WHAT tragedy ? What you mean losing an imbecile who finds someone like Bill Bule AMUSING ? Give us a break .
1901_10.txt,1, This movie is all about blaxploitation there is absolutely no plot at all . pimp stops some bad guys with his kung fu hoes to try to get his nightclub back . Rated for Strong Language and a brief sexual situation .
8358_7.txt,1, Aslan Adam or Lionman as it's more commonly known amongst English speaking audiences starts with an epic battle as King Solomon his army defeats a load of guys although I'm not sure who they were the film itself is n't too helpful in establishing the fact . Anyway after King Solomon has slaughtered all these guys Princess Maria Bishop Osorio Commander Antoine are forced to sign a treaty which lets King Solomon rule just about everything in sight . Soon after Princess Maria seduces Solomon they have sex meanwhile in the shortest wedding ceremony ever two sentences long Antoine weds Princess Maria is planning to rebel against Solomon gain some sweet revenge in the process . Antoine his guards attack kill Solomon even though his pregnant wife Princess Almunia escapes with her protector Rostin with Antoine's guards in hot pursuit after the shortest labour ever than minutes or the time it takes to run around a bush Princess Almunia gives birth to a young baby boy who is hidden in some bushes away from Antoine's guards . Unfortunately when Rostin tries to retrieve the little fella he finds that the baby has been adopted by a pride of Lion's as one of their own ! Year's later the evil Antoine now rules treating his subjects with no mercy Princess Maria has given birth he has a son but Rostin is also still kicking around trying to put together a gang of rebels to overthrow Antoine the task seems hopeless unless they can enlist the help of the legendary Lionman who is more beast than man . This Turkish Greek co was directed by Natuk Baytan as Natuch Baitan is a one of a kind type of film found it hilariously bad but at the same time immensely entertaining . The script never seems to take itself seriously it is a pretty funny film at times it moves along like a rocket is never dull or boring some of the English dubbed dialogue is just hilarious in context with what's happening on screen . None of it makes any sense we get a boy raised by Lion's an evil king betrayal dark family secrets birthmarks that form the shape of Lion's in an element of the story that was present before the kid was raised by Lion's crazy fight scenes torture scenes where the posts people are supposed to be tied to wobble ancient castle interiors that randomly contain zip wires gymnastic rings idiotic bad guys who all seem to have extensive facial hair a central character who has a jaw line resembling a house can be stabbed twice have his hands covered in acid acid can eat it's way through steel trapdoors but is kept in a ceramic jug ! fall over feet onto a concrete floor yet maintain no serious injury ! Aslan Adam is a terrifically entertaining film do n't think I've seen another film quite like it that can compare it too if your looking for something serious then forget this but if you like type films want to have fun laugh be entertained then Aslan Adam should be at the VERY top of your list . Total gold for bad film fans those with a taste for the different bizarre . On the disappointing side Lionman only gets his steel claws minutes before the end which is a shame . Director Bayten certainly keeps things moving along at a brisk pace although it's far from well made during the opening battle one moment guys are fighting on a sand dune the next their on a grassy hill with trees in the background ! There is one point where Lionman uses a to pole vault but it's obviously just a long tube with a vine wrapped around it ! Then there's the scene when a bloodthirsty pack of bloodhounds are supposed the chasing Lionman down but the dogs used are obviously different breeds including some of the most harmless looking dogs ever ! There are just so many individual scenes in Aslan Adam that are just hilarious stupid bizarre or all three that could go on forever . Just check the ending out when Lionman is jumping flying about everywhere like he can fly . There's lots of blood in Aslan Adam although not much actual graphic gore or violence a few stabbings someone has their hands cut off is as graphic as it gets . Technically Aslan Adam is pretty ropey the period costumes are bright garish featuring purples yellows reds various other bright colours . The fight scenes are cheap but at least the filmmakers tried to put as much action in as they could . The music seemed like it was more suited to a classical ballet rather than an action film is yet another bizarre aspect to Aslan Adam . The acting was bad even dubbed you could tell the acting was bad . Aslan Adam is pure gold from start to finish there are so many things to like laugh at enjoy in this film that just ended up really liking it . In no way whatsoever can Aslan Adam be considered a good film in any sense of the word but it's one hell of an entertaining one . may have have to watch this one again sometime soon just to prove to myself that did n't dream it all ! The best Turkish action film about a man raised by Lion's you will ever see period . Proved popular enough to spawn a sequel Lionman II The Witchqueen
792_8.txt,1, To my eternal shame I've never seen a silent movie not even the mother of all vampire movies Nosferatu'' However if they display half the creativity and sheer joy of this effort from Buster Keaton then I'll probably try to watch a few more . This is genuinely funny as well as being a stunning introduction to the world of the silent comedies . The premise such as it is focuses around an unfortunate case of mistaken identity as Keaton is mistaken for renowned bad Dead Shot Dan Malcolm St Clair This leads to a number of chases and escapes as the authorities get ever closer to the increasingly desperate Keaton . You're left amazed and entertained in equal measures . Keaton is a natural comedian but also an accomplished stunt judging by the way he leaps and jumps around like Jackie Chan on speed . And the comedy is also of an exceptionally high standard my Better Half had to cut short a phone call to her parents because she was laughing too much ! If you've never experienced a silent movie like this then it is nothing short of a revelation to watch it certainly blew away any ideas may have had about silent films . Naturally it is n't as polished as today's movies the acting is pretty awful truth be told but that does n't matter because you're enjoying the movie regardless . Anyone with a passing interest in movies in general should make the effort to watch this because they will not be disappointed . Brilliant !
8356_8.txt,1, Where do begin ? Walt Disney's happiest motion picture Lady and the Tramp'' is one of if not possibly my favourite in the theatrical canon of Disney animation . The sequel however is . to say the very least enjoyable . enjoyed myself throughout the whole movie . It was up ! adorable ! The Broadway style of the songs and the movie kind of worked and was humming the songs for the rest of the night . can if you asked me to still sing all of the songs . But where the movie was good for me it was bad in a lot of other places . The animation was kind of scary at times . Every time there was a close up shot of someones face do n't know . it just seemed scary to me . Also where the hell was Lady ? She gets like two lines of dialogue and only doggy hugs Scamp at the end . She gets interaction with the plot and her only son ! But all in all liked it . Compared to the original does it hold up ? No . The songs are n't as good kind of catchy though the plot was a lot less involved Lady had almost nothing to do with it and it's not as cute as the first one . But if you go in with an open mind you'll have fun and maybe Like it ?
10448_7.txt,1, Ahhh . makes me think back to the really crazy time we were facing in America . Fresh off the Do What Feels Good'' The Last American Virgin'' comes as a wolf in sheep's clothing as yet another sex comedy from the glory days . Oh sure there's sex but ca n't think of another movie this and Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' really was n't killing time between topless teenage scenes was some pretty good stuff here amongst the cleavage . The movie follows three hormonal friends . Gary to lose his virginity Rick incarnate and David but not inexperienced as they try desperately hard to make sure Gary joins the world of manhood . But a funny thing happens on the way to the kegger falls for Karen brunette who loves the bad boys and ca n't seem to follow through with any sexual conquest that David and Rick can facilitate . Only trouble is Rick and Karen get hot and heavy and Karen skips a period . It's Gary who is by her side as she goes to get her abortion and it's Gary who truly cares . But who is Karen dancing with by film end . Subtract the and add a where necessary . What separates this film from others from the we think about is that by god they attempt some real drama here and not of the my parents just pulled in the driveway variety . And you know what ? bought it . It was n't sloppy . It was n't far And when Gary sees Rick dancing with Karen at the house party at the end of the film actually felt sorry for the guy . Our teenage Romeo actually believed in unrequited love when his heart was broken at the end it all sort of touched me . So all the aside there's an actually pretty believable and engaging story here . Oscar worthy ? Not by a mile but do n't know that I'd lump it into the let's get laid'' category either . Like Fast Times at Ridgemont High they actually were trying to do a true film here letting the hi in between fall where it may .
3801_7.txt,1, spoilers included Although many commentators have called this film surreal the term fits poorly here . To quote from Encyclopedia Britannica's surreal means Fantastic or incongruous imagery'' One need n't explain to the unimaginative how many ways a plucky ten boy at large and seeking his fortune in the driver's seat of a red Mustang could be fantastic those curious might read James Kincaid but if you asked said lad how he were incongruous behind the wheel of a sports car he'd surely protest NO way ! What fantasies and incongruities the film offers mostly appear within the first fifteen minutes . Thereafter we get more iterations of the same in an ever and more squalid progression that far from incongruous soon proves predictable . Not that it were on the other hand literally believable but it were unfair to tax Motorama in particular with this flaw any plausible suspension of disbelief having fallen precipitously on the typical film and viewer's scale of values ever since Raiders of the Lost Ark'' became a blockbuster . Hallucinatory'' How do we know what a hallucination is if part of having one is not knowing that we are having one ? At any rate some people know that they enjoy hallucinogenic drugs'' but if Motorama typifies the result of doing so then I'm at a loss as to why anyone would take them more than once . There is of course the occasional bad trip . The movie must be one of those pun and all . Juxtaposition of words that was startling'' How many times can a ten startle you by uttering Oh my God ! when he likes something or Damn ! when he does n't ? These two interjections are about par for the course with this script . Sadly any sense of the surreal in what passes for dialogue could only reveal in direct proportion one's naivete regarding the speech patterns of the rising American generation . world completely defined and minutely depicted but that makes no rational sense Motorama's world indeed makes no sense but it is about as completely defined as a cartoon in an elementary school newspaper . The numerous guest stars in the cast all have cameo roles even less intelligent than our little hero who exclaims Damn ! in the blink of an eyelash but needs several seconds to concoct the lamest lie . And even character despite appearing in nearly every scene gets no significant development . Here's scant reward for any viewer who sympathizes as must enough to wish to know him better and understand he's coming from . One vaguely senses a far better story and protagonist struggling to get out . Fully recognizable realistically painted images are removed from their normal contexts and reassembled within an ambiguous paradoxical or shocking framework . No we see a succession of stereotypical and ever more dilapidated billboards filling stations greasy eateries cheap hotels and their lowlife habitues along country highways exactly where they stereotypically belong . Largely responsible for perpetuating . the traditional emphasis on content . There is little content moment in Motorama . To sum up Picture British millionaires dressed as clowns or pirates on the way to a posh costume party sitting serene and mute as cautious chauffeurs inch their Rolls like fragile skiffs through a roiling sea of desperate humanity Chinese who implore them through the windows and smear the glass with blood . Or imagine a stadium full of abandoned antiques limousines like those above now rusting and white pianos tinkled by ghosts . Into this detritus wander an exhausted boy and an ailing woman to whom he clings as mother becoming girl who fall asleep side by side on the grass . He is awakened on the Feast of the Transfiguration white and glistering'' day by a brilliant flash on the horizon that is not the rising sun . Finding that his consort has become a corpse he first believes that he has witnessed her soul going up to heaven . Later he explains only a little less innocently learned a new word today atom It's like God taking a photograph . Now are just two samples of cinematic surrealism surrealism whose ironies ripple out far enough to invade its film's very title Empire of the Sun . If you seek surreal do n't miss it . Alas however hard he treads on the accelerator to race his chariot through and beyond the desert no scenes so exquisitely strange rich subtle or gorgeous await Motorama's poor little Gus in his quest . None of the above necessarily constitutes a thumbs on this film . Though somewhat disappointed ca n't dismiss it in view of the respectability of another genre that it does exemplify one influenced to be sure by surrealism but also by expressionism existentialism and Franz Kafka's pessimism amidst omnipotent power structures . Let's try on for size Theater of the Absurd . Turning to article on this style am amazed by how to the extent that Theater of the Absurd is a valid artistic style the above objections to Motorama vanish like a puff of smoke . I'm tempted to quote the entire text as support of the identification . Theater of the Absurd attempts to show that the human situation is essentially absurd devoid of purpose . humankind is left feeling hopeless bewildered and anxious . Having instantaneously achieved his purpose of getting away from a depressing home life among bickering parents Gus finds himself purposeless until he drives past a glittering billboard reading Motorama'' and decides to win the lottery that it promises . As others have already revealed this ambition proves illusory although the game never expires'' the sponsoring corporation has no intention that anyone should ever win and has ways to trick confuse and leave crestfallen any aspirant to the reward . He like others is ultimately disappointed in his dream . Absurdist playwrights therefore did away with most of the logical structure of traditional theatre . There is little dramatic action as conventionally understood however frantically the characters perform their busyness serves to underscore the fact that nothing happens to change their existence . a timeless circular quality emerges . Language in an absurdist play is full of . repetitions . repeating the obvious until it sounds like nonsense . Underneath a sometimes dazzling comic surface we find an underlying message of metaphysical distress . Gus's obsession with a silly game his inane language the plot device wherein he divines a bleak future and returns to an earlier moment and takes a different but still bleak turn so much fits now . While an admirer of the surreal would do better with some films anyway of Spielberg admirers of Motorama as it really is should find fellow not instead but addition in the works of Beckett Ionesco and Genet . But one ca n't quite stop here . After his disillusionment with the game Gus returns to Phil'' Love the first attendant he had met and the one person who had treated him decently although he had also scolded him at a service station advertising Be full Under Phil's tutelage he learns a life of waiting for cars . We might note here that the absurdist playwright Beckett had entitled his most famous play Waiting for Godot and that for Godot we should read God . God is one of Phil's preoccupations too . Furthermore as the indirect result of his previous encounter with Gus Phil is badly maimed and goes about in a cast with his arms straight out horizontally . In the last scene Gus now Phil's protege says that he wants to hear music . We hear none but we see Phil wiggling his fingers at the end of his outstretched arm beckoning Gus closer and Gus responds . The End . Finally on to an author whom happen to be reading currently the Anglican theologian William Stringfellow . If this rebel is not acknowledged as an architect or undergirder of Liberation Theology which is more a Roman Catholic than an Anglican movement perhaps he should be . Police brutality and corporate greed are a cliche in cinema and literature including Motorama but Stringfellow supports and illuminates such sentiments with impressive warrants from scripture tradition and reason . His most significant work is an expose of the earthly activities of those fallen angels whom the Bible refers to as principalities and powers . Principalities wrote Stringfellow are behind all of our popular three I's Images Institutions and Ideologies . All of these commend themselves to our worship by making false promises . The more deeply involved with an image an institution or an ideology any person becomes the more his own personhood becomes depleted'' and be becomes a slave to them . Promising power control and immortality they inexorably deliver helplessness chaos and death . As essentially fallen defeated powers they can do no more than that . Yet they beguile humans with that dominion over the earth'' promised by God in the book of Genesis while in fact no one of us controls an image an institution or an ideology bent inevitably on its own hegemony and self They take on lives of their own . Dominion'' happens to be a mistranslation a more accurate rendering of the Hebrew would be stewardship . But this is a quibble beside a more fundamental problem Most of us neglect to notice that God had delegated this power to Adam the fall . We have no reason to assume that we his descendents still exercise it now on the contrary it should be obvious that demonic forces have stolen it from us . One might add two observations of Lewis First that man's conquest of nature'' is a mere illusion and a ruse to cover the fact that one is really talking about the conquest of some men by other men with nature as the instrument and secondly contrary to popular belief Satan is no kind of good Charlie . He may dangle out pleasures at first but he is very niggardly with them and will withdraw them from any human firmly in his thrall perhaps leaving his prey sitting in front of the fire feeling miserably sorry for himself and seething with resentment . Now applying these insights to Motorama we seem them mirrored remarkably in Gus's experience . He is if not nice at least a pretty little boy prior to falling victim to the Motorama game . The first signs advertising it glisten glamorously . The longer he continues however and the deeper he journeys towards the sponsoring corporation's headquarters the more shabby they become . He's lonely meeting no one else who plays the game . The stations giving out the cards have either fallen into ruins or are staffed by zombies . The people he does meet along the way are more and more ugly deceitful and hostile . fact that the principalities answer to a common dictator does not mean that they can abide one another Gus's humanity is leached out of him as he becomes not only totally self and oblivious to the needs of others but partially blinded . disfigured . prematurely aged while infantile in the literal sense of linguistically challenged . Eventually even his precious Mustang is taken from him in a crash and he must continue in a dead man's wreck . Yet at long last having done everything he thought was expected he presents himself to the principality in its proud tower to receive his prize . Using the biblical power to confuse wielded by those who have built such monuments to their own vanity its agents evade him disappoint insult and finally throw him from the top floor . He FALLS long and hard landing finally in a body of water . In other words in classic symbolism he DIES . He has met the inevitable bad end of anyone who has put his faith in such a deceiver . But this fate proves to be only a warning look into a mutable future . He repents and returns to Phil and upon seeing him performs the very first generous selfless act we have seen from him for almost an hour and a half noting that Phil is now handicapped and hardly able to insert a hose into a gas tank he asks Can help you with that ? Then seeing the help wanted'' sign he decides to apply for the job explaining to the motorist with whom he was hitch that he reckons he'll get out here because it does n't look like too bad a place to work . This interpretation is conjectural of course and it may surprise or even outrage the film's cult classic'' aficionados who see quite different points in it . If Motorama is n't quite my cup of tea I'm at least convinced now that it's hardly the worst film ever made .
6624_7.txt,1, After watching Ingmar Bergman's Skammen had many feelings but most notably felt unsatisfied . have heard so much hype about this movie but came to find it lacking . Do n't get me wrong can fully appreciate the artistic value of such a film but as far as depth and emotion was not so impressed . found the characters to be disagreeable and unrealistic which detracted from the dramatic effect . In addition the fact that the war was fake led me to feel that the emotion was not real . Dramatic war movies in my opinion are much more effective if the events necessarily the story itself really happened . find that of all the movies that try to show the brutality this one falls in the middle as far as effectiveness .

10353_10.txt,1, Totally disgusting and cheap bawdy humor . loved it ! It is the most disgusting and totally horribly acted film except for Nicolas Read who plays an un Court Jester to comic brilliance . But being that as it may laughed so many times and have to hand it to the film makers it was n't pretentious or ordinary in any way . Raping fighting zombies vomitting on their rape victims . What other movie has this ? Not for the quesy but with a pizza a bong and a six pack of beer you got it made if you have a cast iron stomach and a juvenille sense of humor like myself .
12161_8.txt,1, Britain and France declared war on Germany in but by then almost all of Europe had fallen under the advance of the Nazi war machine . Entering the war Britain virtually started from scratch with scarce supplies and with an air force that was outnumbered by Germany ten to one . But the will of the Brits was firm emboldened by their new Prime Minister Winston Churchill who declared We shall never go under'' On August the Battle for Britain was on . However for the first time since Hitler's declared stance to conquer the world he hit a wall . Though massively outnumbered the British Royal Air Force went on the offensive and in the span of twenty eight days in September and October of German Luftwaffe casualties climbed to two thousand three hundred seventy five lost planes and crew . Hitler's rage was seething but he had to call a momentary time out . Responding later in the year Hitler launched a massive fire bombing of London on Christmas Day of When say that there has never been a disaster movie to rival the real live footage of London in flames during this assault would be an understatement . Perhaps the most surreal effect of this chapter in the Why We Fight'' series would be seeing British citizens emerge from their underground shelters following the bombing raids to resume what was left of their life above ground . Even as you watch there is no way to comprehend the living horror these people must have gone through as the city of London was left in virtual ruin . Yet the Nazis were stunned and stymied as well . Everything Hitler wanted to believe about freedom and democracy was now turned on it's head . Instead of being weak willed and complacent like the French the British were not going to give up without a fight . And fight they did taking the air battle to Germany and responding in kind with attacks on the German homeland . It was a turning point forcing Hitler to rethink his strategy .
1741_10.txt,1, loved this show . Such talent and am so disappointed that it is canceled after only just beginning . looked forward to this show all week long . And so sorry for the people who were hoping to be The One . would have loved to see who would have won . It just began and in my opinion should not have been canceled . hope these young artist have been viewed by talent scouts and have the opportunity to reach their goals . voted and sat waiting for it to come on never knowing that it was canceled . And could not believe that it was . am amazed that it had low ratings because it was in my opinion one of the best reality shows on TV .
11403_9.txt,1, I've seen both movies and saw without a doubt the re is the best know a lot of people would disagree those who have become fans of the original will most probably not like this re but thought it was well thought out and definitely scary It was so good I'm going to see it again tonight the original creeped me out because they kill the children mean who does that in movies anyway . in this one the children have at least half a chance . only bad part about this movie is when the babysitter Walks towards the sounds she hears and runs outside into the bushes to check for someone clearly no one in their right mind would do that whilst babysitting so that is the only thing found wrong with the movie and even so they probably had to put that in there to build suspense do n't want to give too much away for all those who have not seen it recommend you do instead of listening to all these people saying its crap and worse than the original it would be a better movie for teenagers as it displays things that most of us are scared of but when was in the movies there were at least adults over the age of in there watching it and they enjoyed it if they enjoyed it think you will to ! give it a out of
12058_9.txt,1, Certainly not a great show but better than most other sitcoms out there at the moment . It reminds of shows like Married With Children and Roseanne as they go to places not traditionally dealt with in sitcoms . It's sometimes funny even if you ignore the laugh tracks but not rip hilarious . Some of the characters are pretty funny gay friend and some of the other drop This is also one of the few shows where the characters soliloquy for the butchered spelling actually is effective and funny . Is this an All in the Family or Seinfeld type show ? Absolutely not . However it is certainly better than a show like Deat the worst TV show of any type out at the moment Oh and the mom is not too bad looking and the Hilary character is a little hottie .
4740_9.txt,1, There have been many documentaries that have seen in which it appeared that the law was on the wrong side of the fence The Thin Blue Line and Paradise Lost come to mind first and foremost . But this is the first film that had me seething with anger after saw it . It seems blatantly clear to me from the evidence presented in this film that what happened at Waco was at the very least an unprofessional and sloppy mess on the part of the FBI and AFI and at the very worst an act of murder . Like most people when the siege at Waco was occurring assumed that David Koresh was a completely evil madman who was leading a violent cult . After seeing this think that Koresh was more likely a slightly unbalanced and confused guy who inadvertently caught the attention of the government through his eccentric actions . Sure there were lots of weapons at the Branch Davidian compound . But none of it was illegal . It was absolutely heartbreaking to see the video footage of the people inside the compound all of them seeming to be very nice and harmless . And it was angering to see the callous testimony of the men in charge of the government forces on the Waco site the clueless testimony of Janet Reno and the partisan defense of the attack on Waco a defense led by a few of the committee Democrats . Standing out most in my mind was NY representative and current senator from NY Charles Schumer . voted for the man when lived in NY state I'm a Democrat pretty left too . After seeing his actions on this committee wish could go back in time and vote for D'Amato instead ! For anyone remotely interested in the government this is a very crucial film a must see . even think this should be shown in classes it's that important .
2322_7.txt,1, It starts a little slow but give it a chance . In the spirit of the Wackiest Ship in the Arm'' and the Pink Sub'' this movie is about a not so orthodox group engaged in not so orthodox methods to outwit everyone . Rob Schneider is priceless as a LT that takes himself way too seriously which results in a failed mutiny attempt and pirate'' crew makes him walk the plank . In contrast Kelsey Grammar to Cary Grant not take anything to serious except the job . This movie is more about lines than plot . From the beered up'' fisherman in Charleston harbor to the whale'' decoy their antics took me by surprise and laughed out loud .
12336_7.txt,1, did n't know anything about this movie before watched it . It seems to be a lesser teen horror from the What struck me were the ways it differed from so many other movies from that era . The first thing noticed was how slowly this movie builds . It does n't do the typical setup of showing characters being murdered one by one . It takes its time building the back story leaving a little bit of mystery about what might happen . was almost starting to think no one would even really get hurt in this movie . But everything leads to the climatic sequence during the last minutes and then it gets fairly graphic was a bad time to take a snack break almost could n't finish my pizza once it started The characters also seem slightly more three than a lot of the cheap teen scare flicks . There conversations were refreshingly level for the most part as opposed to the over stereotypes you'd expect . For example the girl who is the popular snobby queen of the clique is n't constantly spouting insults at everyone but is capable of having doubts and showing some consideration for others . So to summarize felt this movie was somewhat original compared to what expected and a little better made as well . It drew me in kept me interested and then let me have it . As said it's pretty gory during the finale but almost family friendly much of the rest of the time . do n't need to own it but I'm glad discovered it .
8304_7.txt,1, have fond memories of watching this when it came out . It's one of those films that you know is rubbish even when you're a kid but at that age you overlook the ludicrous acting special effects and plot there's a race of big nymphets living underground huh ? and just enjoy the campy monsters for all they're worth .
7211_7.txt,1, Can this really be a Troma movie ? Some scenes almost have an movie look . The acting is generally competent two leads and the nurse were especially good and liked some of the confrontations between the young Capulets and Ques the scenes were smoothly edited the plot is coherent . It's funny . It has a hip original sound track . It does have the usual Troma gross and low humor but do n't think Shakespeare would have minded so much . In fact think he might have gotten a few good laughs out of this . It's a good DVD . There is an alternate sound track with a very informative commentary by the director several deleted scenes and the usual collection of Troma self silliness . I'm not going to tell you this was Citizen Kane but it is some pretty inspired low filmmaking .
10038_7.txt,1, Naturally along with everyone else was primed to expect a lot of Hollywood fantasy revisionism in THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON over the legend of Custer . Just having someone like Errol Flynn play Custer is enough of a clue that the legend has precedence over the truth in this production . And for the most part my expectations were fulfilled an admittedly rousing and entertaining way Yet even in this obviously biased much criticized retelling of the Custer story was struck by some of the points made in this movie that sometimes subtly but nevertheless solidly seemed to counter the typical clich of manifest destiny and unvarnished heroism usually found in Westerns of the early century . For instance even while this film attempted to whitewash it's hero certain scenes still suggested the more flawed and foolish character of the real Custer His initial entrance at the West Point front gate in which his arrogance and pompousness is a clear aspect of his character . His miserable record at West Point which seems to be attributed as much to Custer's cluelessness about the demands of military service as any other factor there are moments in the way Flynn plays Custer at West Point where he seems downright stupid . Custer's promotion to General is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake but it plays out as slapstick comedy . half to see the Marx Brothers or Abbott and Costello wander into the scene . Custer's stand against Jeb Stuart at Gettysburg is not whitewashed as brilliant military tactical leadership but is presented as reckless and wildly lucky . Custer's drinking problem is certainly not ignored . And although the music and some of the ways the Indians were shown in this film were certainly reinforcements of the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage it still came as a surprise to me that the movie actually went into some detail as to why the Indians were justified in attacking the whites who were moving into their land and fairly explicitly laid the blame for the battles in the Black Hills squarely at the foot of the white man . In fact no one can argue that the clear villain of the piece is not Anthony Quinn as Sitting Bull but Arthur Kennedy Co. as the white devils making the false claim of gold in the Black Hills . Sure that part of the story is true but did n't expect to see it portrayed quite so unequivically in a movie like this . And one other thing usually in these films it is the Indians who are portrayed en masse as drunken animals seemingly incapable of the basic common sense to avoid getting falling down drunk any time they get near alcohol . In this movie it is actually the troops of the Cavalry and not the Indians who in at least two scenes are portrayed this way . All in all this movie slips in some surprising moments in the midst of the Hollywood bunk .
2540_9.txt,1, in his descriptions of CAA platinum card lunches in Hollywood psychoanalysis a vacation in Provincetown he never took and free trips to Nicaragua financed by Columbia pictures . It sounds narcissistic but Spalding Gray because of his unusual personality ropes the audience in laughs at himself because he did not take the Hollywood thing oh and gets us to care . This monologue is not just about The Killing Fields'' or Swimming to Cambodia'' it is more a pastiche of events as he sees them . Some of the lines are classic as when Gray meets with the esteemed talent agents at CAA . The conference table is of them tanned healthy fresh from drinking blue algae from an Oregon lake . are no drugs now in Hollywood'' This was before the tragedy occurred . Many of us will miss his off humor .
8430_10.txt,1, The China Syndrome'' could not have been released at a better time twelve days after its release the infamous screw in Three Mile Island happened . But even if that Chernobyl had never happened this movie remains an important look at what could happen through mismanagement of nuclear facilities . Jack Lemmon turns in a five star performance as the supervisor trying to expose a cover at his nuclear plant with Jane Fonda playing the reporter trying to investigate and Michael Douglas plays her cameraman . do n't know whether or not the current threat of a terrorist attack makes The China Syndrome'' more disturbing but either way it's still definitely a movie that everyone should see . hope that those people who spent years pushing nuclear power saw this movie just so that they could know that their views and ideals are completely defunct .
8530_10.txt,1, Well first of all am a big fanatic of horror movies but however am pretty sick of all those damn American horror movies . They are all about the same thing blood and violence . It's not even creepy . Well it's nothin wrong with the blood and all that does n't even bother me but that's not what makes a movie creepy ! That's why find this movie entertaining it's fun to see a satire which is making fun of the koncept main horror USA'' American splatter they are not suppose to be creepy only funny . That's OK . But when they're suppose to be creepy'' it mostly gets pathetic . However there are a few great american horror movies Psycho Birds but in the end it's all the same thing . That's why this movie came as a relief . Evil Ed is not just a cult movie it's a classic ! ca n't wait untill master director Anders Jacobsson makes another goddamn splatter movie ! Untill than have to watch Evil Ed again and again and again ! But do n't care it is such an outstanding movie !
5780_9.txt,1, I'm giving this film out of only because there are n't enough specific scientific references to the amount of energy it takes to produce food to satisfy the science haters . mdixon seems to believe the admittedly biased commentators are making this stuff up but even an elementary understanding of resources and the laws of thermodynamics will indicate that at the very least they are on solid scientific ground when they state that we can not continue to depend on oil we must transition to different types of energy and do not have a plan that will replace the amount of energy we get from oil . Other civilizations have refused to face the facts of life and have perished . Read Jared Diamond's Collapse'' which is a popular book or any elementary Ecology or Earth Science textbook and you can verify the basic premise of this movie . Go ahead fiddle while Rome burns !
3103_7.txt,1, The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer well by veteran character actor Richard Carle being driven by a man hoping to sell him a story for an upcoming play . However there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night . Fortunately there's a mansion nearby though it seems pretty odd that the people inside know the writer and he says he did n't realize this was the home of a man he knew despised However while this seems like bad and contrived writing it is not . this is all part of an elaborate ruse by the writer to have a group of actors in the home act out his plot . However part through the ruse the producer and his browbeaten assistant figure out that the murder mystery taking place in the home is fake and think the whole affair is pretty funny . What no one realizes though is that an escaped maniac is loose and he is about to enter this contrived little plot for some wonderful twists and turns . So when it seems that there is a real murder the actors are truly terrified while Carle and his sidekick are convinced it's all a hoax . While have explained some of the plot there are many more aspects of the film you'll just have to figure out yourself it's surely to keep you entertained and guessing . Considering that this is a in the public domain certainly did NOT have very high hopes for this little film . However was thrilled when the film turned out to be a much better than average flick a very interesting and novel twist on the old clich plot about a dark and stormy night spent in a mansion . Plus while the plotting of the film was very good the dialog was even better lots of sparkling wit and a nice light pace . Full of pleasant surprises and well worth your time .
6757_10.txt,1, brilliant animated piece that was far ahead of its time and certainly far ahead of anything that was being released in mass production at the same point in history . The influence of this work upon Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas'' is readily apparent . One can only imagine how Starewicz slaved over every beautifully detailed frame of this masterpiece . There have been very few animated films of this caliber . It's a shame that more people have n't seen this gem . Apparently IMdB now requires comments to be at least ten lines long so this is the tenth line . This must be something new but really do n't have anything else to say !
3564_8.txt,1, When die someone will bury me . And if they do n't what's the difference . Who gives a damn huh ? Thus the philosophy of life lack there of is summed up once and for all in this less than classic but nevertheless fun spin off of Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy . In the opening scene three obviously evil gunmen ride into a western town and with menacing glares they intimidate all the pathetic normal people hiding in their homes . The observant watcher will notice that each of these three bears a striking resemblance to characters from Leone's For Few Dollars More . There is one guy in Eastwood's poncho one in Lee Van Cleef's black suit and one seeming to act like Gian Marie Volonte's Indio . But this movie is not about these guys . No sooner do they ride into town when they are gunned down by someone even cooler than they a mysterious bounty hunter known simply as the Stranger . No . this is an altogether different story . In an obvious copying of Leone's The Good the Bad and the Ugly three gunmen are again vying for a hidden treasure . Once again there is the bounty hunter and the Mexican bandit . The Stranger Hilton is a supercool bounty hunter with a penchant for shooting people while dressed up like a priest . He is after the reward for the bandit Monetero Roland But when Monetero's gang steals three hundred thousand in gold coins the Stranger gets sidetracked from his normal line of work . To round off the trio there is Edd Byrne's corrupt bank executive Clayton . He too wants the money for himself . But after the money is hidden away the only man who knows where it is gets shot . Now the only clue to the hiding place is a medallion that shows a family crest . The game is too find the treasure before anyone else does . And any gun can play . With plenty of gunfights fist fights and double crosses the action takes these three to the ultimate showdown ripoff a three way draw for the hidden treasure ala The Good the Bad and the Ugly but with a twist . This movie is not as good as Leone's films of course but in the end who gives a damn huh ? This movie is fun nihilism spaghetti western style . There are no rules no enduring loyalties and no right or wrong just the treasure and whatever it takes to get it . And though the movie is not classic the ending surely is . Hey maybe we all can get along after all for a hundred thousand a piece . If you like spaghetti westerns check this one out . It is fast furious and worth the look . My name is Evren Buyruk from Crestline California
5873_10.txt,1, The brilliance of this film lies not in the filmmaking process which is a conventional but executed intertwining tale of the lies of three servicemen post WWII but in the fact that this story was told at all . Samuel Goldwyn deserves credit for having the chutzpah to push through a film who has for its leads a disabled vet with pincers for hands an alcoholic and an underachiever .
453_9.txt,1, As a big Dostoyevsky fan had always been disappointed with Hollywood's halfhearted attempts to get into the Russian romantic aesthetic case in point Yul Brynner as Dmitri Karamazov . had thought the whole problem was a poor casting decisions but then saw Yul as Major Surov and changed my mind . When given an intelligent script to work with he suddenly came alive and was as noble sexy and conflicted as you could ever want a Neurotic Russian Officer to be ! So he was a better Dmitri as Major Surov than he was as Dmitri . But that's because writer Tabori actually gave Yul as the Conflicted Russian Officer the kind of Conflicted Russian Officer lines that are worthy of real literature and that have real meaning and pathos in them . For example a propos of folk music he says musingly You hear a man crying in the dark . And if you listen carefully enough you know what he cries for . You look surprised Lady Ashmore . Despite what you may have heard tractors and Marxism are n't the only things the Russian cares for . There is always time for music . Brilliant !
2814_10.txt,1, At initial thought the concept of this show seemed to be a joke and a gag just for Stan Lee's amusement . expected nothing more than a sleazy animated version of Barb Wire with low production values much like those short pieces of crap you see on Adult Swim for short term amusement but can never taken too seriously . Boy was wrong ! Stripperella has even better production values than similar Marvel Toons . The animation is very good and it seems that they've taken this series very seriously and given it a full effort to make it a professional production as possible . The humor is good too on the sexy suggestive and sleazy side . It is very similar if not exactly like the Simpsons style . You may encounter clich and a lot of predictable humor but its still fun nevertheless . If this were running today I'd surely see it regularly . Its surprisingly one of the better toons ever made .
6964_8.txt,1, Okay so Ghoulies is kind of bad . And it does n't really even have the ghoulies in it . And the acting is bad . The storyline is stupid . But forget to mention how funny this film is . It is so campy and so ridiculous it is too fun not to enjoy . There are only ghoulies in the movie and they do n't really seem to be in relation with the Ghoulies in the other film . But they are pretty funny . And funny thing that Jonathon Graves returns for this one . If you saw the first he was a character in that . In my opinion this is better than the first . There are some classic scenes and some classic lines one which is in a grocery store . Attention Shoppers ! Watch this if you enjoy bad movies . It's so bad it is good . And did mention Barbara Alyn Woods is hot ?
4314_10.txt,1, For me this is a good series . am kind of disappointed that Ana Lucia and Libby died but more upset that Micheal lied to everyone about who killed them . And if any one can answer this what was that guys name who was supposedly Henry Gale'' he was like the leader of the others was that Ms. Clue ? anyway if you know his name cool . Well trying to think of what can possibly happen next after they finally did n't press the button . Does that mess up the whole DARMA project thing and personally thought it was cool how they had that key thing underground that Desmond used to shut off the magnet thing yeah and what was the whole point of that ? am just glad they did n't press the button finally but what happens to the people in the hatch ? Like Mr. Echo John Charlie and well Desmond probably died but what about the others ? think they survived forget ? well this is just my little thing on what thought about this season finale !

6719_7.txt,1, Though it hardly compares to other sci film giants like SPACE ODYSSEY or CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND LIFEFORCE does work as a totally berserk and bizarre melding of science fiction and horror elements . Somehow despite dialogue that approaches the ridiculous and acting that does the same it manages to work because of a few highly different elements . Loosely based on Colin Wilson's novel The Space Vampires'' this film from director Tobe Hooper THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE focuses on a joint US mission aboard the British space shuttle Churchill to study Halley's Comet . Led by an American commander Railsback they discover an alien spacecraft in the comet's coma . And when they investigate the interior of the spacecraft they find alien occupants that look like giant bats . Later on the Churchill reaches Earth's orbit but no response is given from radio calls issued from the mission's home base the Space Research Center in London . Columbia is launched to rendezvous with Churchill but they find the entire ship gutted by fire except for the alien beings encased in glass who far from being untouched by the fire look absolutely perfect . The aliens are bought back to Earth . that's where the incredible happens . These space vampires escape from the Space Research Center and instead of draining their victims of blood via bite wounds suck their victims lifeforce totally out of them . One of them is the Space Girl a thoroughly nude vampiress played by Mathilda May . Railsback the only actual survivor from Churchill is bought in by the SRC's chief Finlay and a British special agent Firth to track May who is in telepathic contact with him . Pretty soon however the vampires have turned London into a scene of pure holocaust people are either being dessicated or turning into zombies and the threat by NATO to sterilize the city with thermonuclear radiation looms large . Railsback finally catches up with May and sacrifices himself by impaling her with a large metal sabre . Undoubtedly disjointed unquestionably uneven but nevertheless worth watching LIFEFORCE despite the frequent incoherency of its script and its acting benefits from some drop excellent special effects work by John Dykstra WARS some of the best ever seen . The other working element and a surprise one it is is the incredible orchestral score by Henry Mancini almost Wagnerian in the same way John Williams score for STAR WARS was Mancini like Williams before him uses the London Symphony Orchestra to boot ! Largely forgotten these days and a critical and box office disaster in LIFEFORCE if for no other reason should still be seen for anyone with a taste for the bizarre . There had never been a film quite like it before and there will certainly not be anything like it again .
2765_9.txt,1, I'll be brief normally hate films like this venomously but there is just something about this one that just draws me in and wo n't let me go . Granted there are some major flaws in it of the acting is below par at best and the dialogue is sometimes so poor it's funny but there are enough redeeming features to make it watchable to the end . But what are they ? Well it's got a cool little plot by no means is it original but it is better presented than other films of its kind . The three main stars Johnson Long put in fairly decent performances that more than make up for the distinct lack of quality from the supporting cast fat cop and Coach Quinn really bugged me and the scripting is slick and witty if it is poor in places The bottom line is though this film is so CUTE grinned all the way through it and it has a place in my video collection purely because it could cheer up anybody . You really have to be some kind of humourless bore not to like this DARE somebody to sit through this without grinning ! do recommend this one if you want a simple fun and above all enjoyable watch . You wo n't regret it !
6717_8.txt,1, LIFEFORCE was one of Cannon Films biggest flops . It received mostly bad reviews and did nothing to help director Tobe Hooper's career in the wake of the Spielberg controversy . All of this is unfortunate because LIFEFORCE is actually a really great movie . It is supremely entertaining moves along at a fast pace and features some of the most outrageously over direction production performances and special effects ever to explode across the screen ! It must have looked bizarre on paper the producers of THE DELTA FORCE the screenwriter of ALIEN the director of THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE the composer of BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S the special effects wizards of STAR WARS . Audiences were not ready for this demented exercise in weirdness . What more do you want ? We got an alien spaceship full of giant bats ! We got a sexy naked space vampiress sucking out people's souls ! We got exploding bodies ! We got zombies ! We got possession ! We got an interrogation ! We got the entire city of London on fire ! It's Dracula meets NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD meets QUARTERMASS AND THE PIT meets EARTHQUAKE . It's quite possibly the single most outrageous horror epic ever unleashed that is if there are any other ones out there . Try watching this movie while chemically altered . Perhaps then you'll understand . genuinely up experience and one of director Tobe Hooper's most underrated movies . Maybe one day it will find its audience .
12196_7.txt,1, Despite a few acceptable adaptations of the books main themes QUEEN OF THE DAMNED VAMPIRE LESTAT did not stay true to Anne Rices's complicated story telling . The deep layers that build up all the characters were shredded apart to only their surface if not a completely different identity . The chronological order of the major events in the movie seemed warped and uneven . However there were quite a few things the movie did to deserve my rating of One was that the film strongly captured the affect that Lestat other vampires to the public especially young girls . The movie also did a fairly good job focusing on the importance of heredity and history that the vampires took pride in . The scenes of sensuality were also atmospherically satisfying . The acting in QUEEN OF THE DAMNED was moderate if disappointing . Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah have a surprising chemistry though it only shows when the acting is at its best very often The characters are nothing compared to the ones established in INTERVIEW WITH VAMPIRE . It also lacks the emotional intelligence of THE FEAST OF ALL SAINTS which is a shame because Rice's Queen of the Damned book had that and more . This movie does n't give all that it appears to be . The effects are dull and very disappointing . The extravagance needed in many scenes is not given and the dialog is tiring . The settings for many scenes are not how pictured them in the book and think that many of them were n't even taken from the story . There are only a few areas of incoherence near the beginning and middle of the movie but it wraps itself up fairly neatly giving the viewer a full story they had not read the book Somethings that feel the movie needed include a good original score Shore or Elmer Bernstein instead of the mix of rock music though had no problem with some of the songs . Another thing that would have made the movie better is better set direction . The scenery was boring as well as unclear which is important in a story that moves around quite frequently . Overall QUEEN OF THE DAMNED was an unevenly disappointing yet somewhat satisfying adaption of the important novel . With a few simple changes it may have been a very successful piece of film work . I'd recommend this movie for people who has seen INTERVIEW or have read the books so that they can make their own opinion on the adaption .
3516_7.txt,1, quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb inbred slash the type where sex equals death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes you actually want to die . However JBD'' delivers considerably more . Rather than focus on bare flesh and gore there is a little of each no sex however the flick focuses on delivering impending dread tension amidst a lovely scenic backdrop . These feelings are further heightened by a cast of realistically likable characters and antagonists that are more amoral than cardboard definitions of evil . Oh yeah George Kennedy is here too and when is that not a good thing ? If you liked Wrong Turn'' then watch this to see where much of its methodology came from .
11503_8.txt,1, This movie is stunningly free from storytelling . It's a pure experience where the music overshadow the visual impression . Words can not of course enough express what should be expressed but it is the requirement of the chattering classes that chatter is put forward entered into production lines of mediocrity and therefore a necessity in order to express any sensible thought or opinion about something which should not need to be degraded by chatter . Therefore these elaborate opinions are put forward to satisfy those empty minds which need to be filled by noise that you will not find however hard you try in this movie .
4382_7.txt,1, After seeing the so acclaimed Fargo and thinking it was nothing more than average was wandering if it would be a good idea to rent another Coen This time was much less disappointed than was with Fargo and must say that most of the credit for that goes to the good jokes and the good acting of George Clooney . Well done Mr. Clooney make more of these and less Stormish movies . You can act and you showed it here . out of
2107_7.txt,1, Alexander Lou star of classics such as Super Ninja and vs Ninja headlines here in this entertaining martial arts fest . The plot involves the evil Abbott White boasts some humongous and frankly somewhat scary looking white eyebrows enlisting the aid of a ninja clan in order to overthrow the Shaolin Temple . This goal he achieves and furthermore wipes out most of it's members although needless to say one or two do manage to survive and rather predictably go on to exact eventual revenge upon the miscreant Abbott . so the plot is n't exactly pushing the envelope in terms of creativity but does anyone watching a film with a title like Tang vs Ninja aka Ninja Hunter really care much for such an inconsequential factor as a plot ? Of course not ! It's the fights that matter in these films and by gum you get your moneys worth here ! There's some superbly choreographed martial arts on display from everyone involved in this and rarely a minute seems to goes by without a fight breaking out for some reason . If your at all into martial arts movies then this is a must see !
2635_10.txt,1, This movie is such a fine example of the greatness that is entertainment . Oh do n't get me wrong most of the music back then sucked . only ever liked the metal bands from the Bands that had some balls . Forget that whiny keyboard crap and all that is horrible and want to die garbage . But the movies from the are the best . They were all about nonsense and just having a good time . This movie exemplifies that ! Party ! Get naked ! Get laid ! WOOOOOOHOOOOO !
6968_10.txt,1, Okay okay must admit do somewhat like Peter Liapis and I'll admit this is not the best Ghoulies sequel . mean yeah it had its flaws such as NO GHOULIES themselves . But the two Ghoulies that come to earth were really funny guess they were called Dark and Lite . enjoyed the plot of the movie . And even at the end of the movie both Ghoulies implied that there would be a sequel . Still waiting . lol . Peter Liapis reprised his role as Jonathan Graves this time playing a detective how cute ! Ghoulies IV may not be scary or suspenseful but it is definitely funny . thought would comment on this movie and just say it's not that bad . It is worth watching even though the Ghoulies are n't in it .
11410_7.txt,1, Simon Wests pg thriller about a babysitter who gets disturbing prank calls while sitting at a mansion is neither original nor exciting enough to be called a good film . Although there are some elements of suspense good eye candy and decent characters the film is just another know what you did last summer as it falls short of being taken seriously . The performances were alright but nothing special with this flick say skip it unless you are looking for a mediocre movie you can find better films than this on lifetime sometimes okay maybe not lifetime but at least USA or somethin haha .
12422_7.txt,1, Two city guys are driving through Hicksville USA when a rusty monster truck suddenly appears and repeatedly attempts to run them off the road . picked up a mysterious blonde hitchhiker pull up at a truck full of redneck amputees of whom warns them of demon out there But they do n't listen . mistake ! Man'' by Michael Davis mixes comedy with horror surprisingly well . film borrows heavily from Duel'' Blair Witch Project'' Creepers'' and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' story is pretty silly there is enough gore and violence to keep splatter freaks happy . enjoyed especially the performance of Justin Urich offers the film its comedy relief . the complete lack of suspense is hard to forgive . this one a chance you have some time to waste . out of mention that Aimee Brooks is sexy ?
8650_7.txt,1, The whole movie made me think of the first circle of Dante's Inferno Where the souls who themselves in believing that they are happy go to . They never realize they are actually in an inferno but nothing is enjoyable they just move on without any emotion . In that sense Dante thought that they the were in the worse part as they would never actively try to change their situation . Nobody can die in that place but trying to certainly does hurt . am not sure if the writer based his story on this medieval manuscript or not but the resemblance is absolutely striking . did n't enjoy the movie when was watching it as was expecting a climax which never came . Nevertheless it made me think afterwards and now actually think it's a good film it surely does stick .
1327_9.txt,1, heard that after the first Oceans movie the sequels begin to go downhill . believe that this is not the case least not for this film This movie is even better than the first film ! The original crew returns three years after they successfully robbed Terry Benedict's casinos . Now Benedict is visiting each one of them personally telling them to get the money back within two weeks . To do that they must do a couple heists in Europe to get the money . The acting is very good . The all cast exceeded expectations . Matt Damon Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta were probably the best in this film . There are some confusing moments in this film . But that does not matter because there are only a few confusing moments . Anyway this movie is only made for harmless fun . Overall this is a great heist movie . rate this movie
5971_10.txt,1, If you have a chance see this Russian should call them gems masterpieces treasures ? war movies like this one or The dawns here are quiet or Proverka na dorogah . And right after that watch again the American war movies or the international productions those one with the allies and the Germans Or even worse watch the Italian war movies . Everything from the west will seem shallow contrived ridiculous in comparison with the Russian movies . am sooooo stunned by the quality of the aforementioned Russian war movies that can not find the words to praise enough their shattering superiority over Anglo war movies .
8975_8.txt,1, Aaron Sorking raises the same questions as Shakespeare did or does . How could they possibly know so much about the inner workings of palace life . Here like in The West Wing Sorkin opens surprising doors that are hardly a shock but seem ton confirm our worst fears . Everything is so casual and at the same time so directly responsible for so many people's lives . puffy Tom Hanks tells us one way or another that things can be manipulated with semi pure intentions but without weighing the consequences and Julia Roberts in a blond southern hairdo reminds us of the powers harbored in the sidelines . The subject is serious but the treatment is light intelligent but light . Philip Seymour Hoffman as the invisible middle man steals every scene he is in just like Charles Laughton did in every movie he was in . dialogue is fast but not fast enough for us not to catch up and discover that this is not an ordinary comedy . The seemingly casual pace filled with strokes of wit and provocation grants another badge of honor in the Mike Nichol's collection .
5640_9.txt,1, This depiction of forlorn Japanese forces in the Philipines is a tour de force in the utter meaninglessness of war . It is an effective representation of Japanese pacifist views after WW II . In the movie Japanese soldiers have been left to fend for themselves in the jungles of the Philipines . Faced with impending starvation they resort to cannibalism and gradually lose what little humanity they have left . To call this film depressing would be something of an understatement . The viewer is left with an utterly despairing sense of life's lost value in modern combat . The final scene is almost too nihilistic but the film is a worthy statement none Highly recommended .
6893_7.txt,1, saw Smell the Dead sorry SELL the Dead at a press screening . Glenn McQuaid the film's writer is a laddish Irishman who introduced the screening by announcing that whilst it was in progress he would be out for a pint do n't begrudge him a drink but by telling us about it he seemed to feel he needed to certify his laddishness or his Irishness or both . When the opening credits rolled there were as usual at press screenings loud ovations for the names of every actor or crew member who'd got friends in the audience and silence for those who had n't . McQuaid returned for a witty afterwards . This horror movie does n't take itself seriously which is good because its humour is considerably stronger than its horror . Only one scene is even remotely scary and most of the is merely gross but laughed throughout much of the film . This movie appears to be set in Ireland circa which time grave was mostly defunct The story is told in flashback we get flashbacks within flashbacks and the narrating character flashbacks material that he could n't know about because sometimes he was n't present or one case because the action is unfolding behind his back . The story begins with a prisoner being taken to the guillotine . Guillotines were n't used in Ireland but for once we actually see a plausible guillotine sequence . The prisoner struggles on his way to execution the rope cleats are accurate and the prisoner manages to look up to see the blade overhead . there's a payoff later to justify the historically inaccurate use of the guillotine itself . The characters are ostensibly Irish but one major character speaks in Cockney slang using phrases like mug's game'' and take a butcher's'' a look For once actors in roles display dental hygiene yet nearly all the clothes and hairstyles the women's make are resolutely I'm not complaining in the case of Heather Bullock who wears a very fetching black miniskirt cozzie that appears to be PVC . Phworr ! The lead actors Ron Perlman are excellent but most of the supporting cast have no sense of the Victorian period . The worst offender is Joel Garland as the publican whose characterisation is firmly rooted in the twenty century . Just when thought that Garland's performance could n't get any less Victorian he used his fingers to make ironic'' air The sets Angus Scrimm's lab are detailed and impressive yet failed to convince me that people actually lived and worked in these places . Nearly every interior contains burning candles but never once did see what would have been there if these were actual Victorian homes or workplaces leftover drippings from previous candles . One scene features an extra was annoyed that McQuaid plumped for a stereotypical grey'' Schwa alien rather than something original . There are splendid montage sequences but McQuaid opts for flashy effects split overhead shots that do n't serve the story . was impressed by a recurring blue device superimposing the main characters heads over other backgrounds . Less effective was a recurring motif of camera shots morphing actors faces into drawings resembling panel art from EC horror comics . I'm a fan of EC Comics but they do n't belong in Ireland . The money that McQuaid spent on flashy photo showing off his editing skills without serving the story should've been spent on accurate costumes . BIG SPOILERS NOW . Ron Perlman gives an Oirish'' performance full of acting tics . Ostensibly playing a Irish priest he writes with his left hand . Victorian Ireland left children were punished for using the devil's hand'' and were forcibly retrained to become righties . But Perlman's character turns out to have a reason for concealing his right hand . Elsewhere a character is bitten by a zombie yet suffers no ill effects so knew there'd be a payoff later . Several scenes that would more logically take place at night are shot in daylight apparently only because this was easier and less expensive . McQuaid is a proficient director and editor he could easily have shot day for night'' but using a process effect to help tell the story seems to interest him much less than showing off his flashy editing techniques . McQuaid seems to be giving homage to those great old Hammer horror flicks . But those Hammers were so great because the actors and production designers worked hard to convince us that we were actually witnessing events in Whitechapel or wherever . Sell the Dead almost entirely fails to evoke the century . Glenn McQuaid shows talent as a director scripter and editor yet in all three capacities here he makes odd choices then largely fails to justify those choices . But enjoyed Sell the Dead I'll rate it out of and look forward to his next movie .
6938_8.txt,1, Do indie horror auteur Todd Sheets returns with another entertainingly atrocious nickel'n shot clunker that's basically just a feeble excuse to sling around a lot of watery blood and gleaming guts as often as possible . An evil demonic scarecrow resurrects the dead as ravenous rot zombies so they can feast on the living . bunch of bickering college kids a trio of dangerous escaped convicts led by the vicious Slade Nichodemus hamming it up to an outrageous degree two equally savage sleazeball hoodlums and a trio of hottie sisters all have to do their best to survive this harrowing ordeal . That's it for the needlessly muddled and convoluted plot but fortunately what this hilariously horrendous hoot lacks in narrative coherence it more than compensates for with a pleasing plethora of gloriously gross'n gore . Disgusting highlights include a woman having her fingers chopped off a fatal gunshot to a young gal's groin attempted necrophiliac rape evisceration and of course more repulsive entrail eating than you can shake a pile of moist intestines at . Moreover we've also got rough grainy cinematography that constantly alternates between washed color and grimy black and white ineptly staged fight scenes lousy acting from a uniformly pathetic no cast Angell in particular cops the top crummy thespic dishonors for his laughably abysmal histrionics as slimy no psycho criminal Joe Bob a grating head thrash metal soundtrack and a generic shivery'n synthesizer score . Let's not forget the ridiculous ending in which several of our survivors stumble across a few vials of flesh bacteria to use on the shambling undead hordes . Sure this flick is pure dreck but it has a certain endearingly abominable quality to it that in turn makes it a great deal of so Grade fun for hardcore aficionados of bad fright fare .
11292_10.txt,1, The visual effectiveness of this film is unmatched by anything I've seen . And the work required to make achieve it must have been incredibly long and tedious do n't just stick Kodak Grainy Film'' in your camera to get this look Do n't watch this film to be entertained watch it to be visually stimulated watch it to be challenged and provoked in your thoughts on film and any other topic that comes to mind religion will likely be one thought .
4596_7.txt,1, lot of things in this futuristic satire are more theoretically funny than actually funny it does have some laugh moments but a lot of that is because it seems to have been cut by the studio to better appeal to exactly the idiots it's mocking . Many situations are n't allowed to develop there's obvious overdubbing of expository material and worst of all a narrator explains EVERYTHING of which needs no explanation probably because some preview audience did n't understand what was going on . In other words a movie about dumbing down has been . you guessed it . One hopes that a longer better version of this comedy will eventually surface on DVD and it will become the cult fave it deserves to be but even in this mutilated and somewhat comic spirit form it's one of the more memorable films of the year a screech of disgust against our culture and all the ways it's become trashified stupidified and uglified in the name of appealing to the yahoos . watched it right after Land of the Dead George Romero's latest milking of the single idea that consumers zombies which is basically the same point Judge is making yet where Romero's counterculture viewpoint zombies underclass that needs to revolt against the rich seems hopelessly out of date Judge's take is fresh dead and far more disturbing . Just listen to the yahoos in your movie audience whooping it up for President Camacho's State of the Union just like their counterparts on screen and you'll know that we're all doomed .
6559_7.txt,1, Horror movie time Japanese style . Uzumaki was a total freakfest from start to finish . fun freakfest at that but at times it was a tad too reliant on kitsch rather than the horror . The story is difficult to summarize succinctly a carefree normal teenage girl starts coming face to face extremely disturbing events as the small town she lives in seems to come under the control of spirals . The spirals are everywhere in the air clouds dirt and everyday objects . The spirals take control of people and bad things will happen to them . Oh another thing people are randomly turning into snails . Why ? Who knows or cares people are turning into snails that's enough for me . This was n't as much scary as just creepy as it does n't have a lot of suspense or jarring attacks as horror films often do . Uzumaki prefers to creep and crawl a snail might ! rather than to jolt . favorite scene a woman lies sleeping in a hospital room when this long thousand legged centipede creature makes its way into the room and slowly up the bed post across the sheets over the pillow and into her sleeping ear . cringed and curled my toes . Uzumaki has a handful of scenes really violent but that are sort of humorous as well . For example a man is obsessed spirals he gets into his washer because he sees a spiral in it when it spins he commits spiral suicide inside the washer . The last shot we see of him is his body all coiled rubber like a human flesh spiral a engorged single eye blinking in the middle of the washer . bizarre image . Uzumaki has a blatant psychodelic slant to it which adds to its charm and fun . love horror movies like this . It's not about killing a la slasher films it's about a force of evil spirals ! taking over you and trying to kill you force you to kill others . Films like Uzumaki prove that there are many ways to make a horror film and thank goodness for that
4149_8.txt,1, This review is in response to the submission wondering how factually correct the movie was . Saw this movie last year and found it inspiring that hopeful immigrants like my Italian grandparents who came through Ellis Island at the turn of the last century would subject themselves to all manner of invasive inspection just to enter America . It was certainly eye opening since my grandparents never spoke of anything terrible while there . My grandmother was old and my grandfather when they arrived . just returned from a trip to New York where had the pleasure of visiting Ellis Island and the museum actually walks you through the immigration evaluation process The filmmaker obviously did his research right down to the medical exams and equipment questions and puzzles . They are all there at the museum . Even the wedding pictures and the review board room Factually correct ! Anyone who has immigrant grandparents should see this movie . Inspirational to say the least .
6289_7.txt,1, This is the only Pauly Shore movie you should ever see . it's the only one I've ever seen and think I've made good choices . normally find Shore's shtick kind of tired but he is very funny in this movie . Actually the script is pretty funny and Shore does n't overwhelm the other actors with his what do you call it ? Tomfoolery ? Anyway this is a funny if ultimately forgettable film .
8914_9.txt,1, And a hard spot somewhere else . have n't seen this movie since was quite young maybe or who knows . But what do know is this is the movie that taught me how to masturbate . kid you not . have no idea if it is any good by any real standards of today but for me back then it was everything . The only reason feel comfortable writing this is because i'm sure no one will ever get around to reading it . mean really who is going to look up this movie these days ? just discovered that have not yet used up the ten line minimum for the amount of length most take up in a review . had no idea there was such a minimum length but there go like a student trying to fill up a page in a journal my ten lines . thank you very much .
8025_7.txt,1, saw this movie last night and thought it was decent . It has it's moments guess you would say . Some of the scenes with the special ops forces were cool and some of the location shots were very authentic . wo n't be putting this movie in my DVD collection but it is fair enough to recommend for renting . guess nothing set the movie at another level compared to others of the same genre . The action is good the acting is decent the women are extremely seductive and exotic in my opinion and the story is pretty interesting . out of ten
11471_7.txt,1, was given a DVD of Public Enemies and was expecting it to be the version but it was n't it was this ! Sure it was n't the greatest movie have ever seen not by ANY means but heck folks it was worth more that out of When saw that abysmal rating on IMDb wondered what was going to get but since the disc was in the player settled down to watch it . As other commentators have pointed out Public Enemies is NOT a historical movie per and noted that unlike the version have n't seen yet IMDb does n't categorise it as such . Come on people ! It's a STORY based on some real people that's all ! If wanted a history lesson I'd sit at this computer and read Wikipedia or something . Ma Barker name Arizona or Arrie Barker was NEVER even charged with any crime and as other commentators have already pointed out she probably never even took part in her sons activities . They sent her to the movies when they were working'' hope she was n't as critical as some of those who watched this movie ! Theresa Russell had the never task of portraying a woman from the age of right through to her death at the age of from a young girl running from home to the hardened mother of four hoodlum sons . think she did it pretty well . The cheeky little smile she used in more than one scene was classical ! OK will agree with some of the critics that the direction of this film was below par and sympathise with the actors over that . Theresa should have told the director to forget the topless shots they did n't contribute to the story . Maybe some bigger stars would have managed to inject some of their own expertise into overriding the poor direction whereas the second were n't quite that brave . Who knows ? But whilst this was certainly no block it WAS worth more than have all my DVDs on a personal database where score them BEFORE looking at the IMDb score that sometimes influences slight changes later take what get on it's own merits rather than holding one movie up against others of the same genre and this one felt was entertaining enough to get I'll accept that such a practice does tend to depend on my mood at the time but then is n't that also true of those who vote on IMDb ? However you may imagine my surprise when looked at IMDb and saw the pitiful score it got here . Given the surprise decided to read a few of the other comments in the hopes of understanding the low rating and noticed that they are quite polarised . agreed with those who said the movie was worth watching and came to the conclusion that some people are just hard to please . Well since some were absolutely scathing why do n't THEY get out there and make some better movies ? will look forward to the gems they must be able to turn out ! On the other hand if they ca n't do that then why do n't they just shut up ?
9492_10.txt,1, Some people do n't like Led Zeppelin but luckily the number of people who versus the number of people who do n't is WAY unbalanced . am the proud converter of or Led Zeppelin fans and the only reason was able to do this is because of this DVD . For one how someone can listen to Stairway to Heaven'' or Immigrant Song'' without falling in love with Zeppelin is beyond me but to play the guitar and not like Page . That is like being Christian and not liking Jesus . My friend was like Led Zeppelin sucks ! and was like Oh yeah watch this ! After about mins of watching Page pick through White Summer Mountain Side'' he was glued to the screen and has never said a bad thing about Zeppelin since . Incase you have n't been following the running metaphor am calling this DVD the Bible of Led Zeppelin . Held high by the followers and used as a converter for the unwashed heathens . Course there are some things missing like Over the Hills and Far Away a good version of Immigrant Song'' and really did n't need version of Whole Lotta Love but what the hell I'll take Because there is nothing besides The Song Remains the Same'' to compare this too gave it a and even if there were more to compare it too still would have given it a
6116_10.txt,1, For all viewers out there who have slammed John Waters for creating a film like Pink Flamingos just stop . It's getting you nowhere . Has anyone ever cared to stop and think about the ambition and dedication Mr. possesses . To gather your best friends up and to create a movie just to gross out thousands of viewers all over shows this man has a great deal of ambition inside himself . Just read his biography Shock Value . It discusses the lengths he went through to get this film finished . Maybe it was n't just the fact that John made this film to gross people out it was to prove that there can be something such as good bad taste

9016_8.txt,1, It would appear that some previous reviewers may have had their expectations set a bit too high going into this film . found it scanning the satellite channels for something knowing what and happened upon it . thought by the title it might be one of the myriad soft porn flicks appearing regularly on the movie channels but was pleasantly surprised . Although there was some male frontal nudity fact more than your typical soft title go figure ! this was not the focus of the film . It was just fun . Do n't be deceived by my tastes my recent screenings have included Before Night Falls and Europa Europa geat IMHO But also enjoy total mental shutdown when watching a movie . Virtual Sexuality did this for me and that's not a bad thing !
11280_10.txt,1, Sui generis . Folks I'm not going to lie to you Merhige is a one or two hit wonder but what a film almost excuses SUSPECT ZERO I'm also not going to pretend to understand it completely half of what makes it what it is is trying to second guess what the hell they are doing on the screen because of the chiaroscuro . Richard Corliss says It is as if a druidical cult had re for real three Bible stories creation the Nativity and Jesus torture and death on Golgotha . That's not a bad description but there seems to be more to it than the seemingly one religious correspondences . There's an environmental theme right up near the surface note that toward the end the barrenness of the landscape there are large pipes not unlike those on a construction site . Oh no he's going to say look at how people are raping mother nature . One rarely sees a dead metaphor in action and with this much hyperbole but to see it acted out is way grislier than language implies . And yeah if you just want something to sync with a death metal soundtrack it does have the requisite atrocities . But as for myself and others like me it's an important art film that should merit a Criterion collection release . Ranks right up there with Murnau's FAUST . Ray

Why is he the only passenger ? Is he a prisoner ? Is he the bothersome man'' referred to in the title of the movie ? Has he died and gone to heaven or hell ? Like our man we do n't get a chance to stop and wonder . He is met by a gatekeeper of sorts and shuttled off to a nondescript city . From day one all the choices are made for him . An apartment has been rented a job has been found an office assigned . In fact his life is not entirely unlike life in the virtual reality of corporate cubicles and suburban condos . Women are heartless dinner parties are a drag office jobs suck . But some pieces do n't fit the puzzle . Silently efficient gray goons roam the streets . Are they some sort of paramedics or the secret police ? And why are there no children ? Is the story even set in the real world ? Whenever we think we might be getting some answers new mysteries unfold . The Bothersome Man'' leaves you half relieved that it's over half wanting more . hope they make it into a computer game soon .
9626_8.txt,1, saw Five Fingers at the Drive in . It was the the first Kung movie I'd ever seen and was greatly entertained . recently bought it on DVD and watched it again . was greatly entertained the second time too . believe this is probably the one most Kung movies are modeled after . Rival Schools different styles revenge white hat'' good guys and black hat'' bad guys . They even threw in the Japanese bad guys styles of Karate and Judo . remember being amused by the dubbing dialog along the lines of Hey You ! You are a very bad guy ! and They should not get away with this ! will have a go at this bad crowd ! This time it was n't so distracting guess I'm used to it . If you have even the slightest appreciation of this genre this is one you should see .
4956_9.txt,1, OK yes its bad yes its complete fluff yes it makes dobbin the mule look like an Oscar winner but look at it like did was special effects were pretty much non exsistant in of films back in the good Ole days when films needed a story line . OK so even the storyline is a bit dodgy . but wow did get into this film as a kid in the cheesy rock bad special effects but airplanes an aerial fights and it had queens one vision on the soundtrack . see even the worst things have a silver lining . all in all if you want a bad film to show a year old who hates computer effects there is such a film this is the ideal choice
8204_7.txt,1, You could get into the nitty gritty of this film and say how it could n't happen or how could the main character just walk into offices and start using computers etc without someone noticing and really pick the movie to bits . you could just sit back with a bucket of popcorn and enjoy the story and the acting . Personally prefer the latter live real life and watch the news with all it's doom and gloom and so would much rather be entertained by my movies and see the bad guys get their just rewards . Do n't take it too seriously and you can thoroughly enjoy this film .
4573_10.txt,1, Idiocracy felt like Mike Judge took my thoughts on society and put them into film . In fact the movie is a social commentary . Almost feels like a documentary at times . Luke Wilson did a good job playing a boring average joe in most of his movies Of Course Idiocracy was an extreme of the current state of society . But that's what makes most comedies funny a extreme of any situation . Fiction is n't that much different then reality . With kids praising materialist Hip culture and taking pride in being ignorant . When people feel useless in life they breed . Giving them a purpose in the world . And it seems only the worse people breed the most . can understand how others do n't like it . It does n't help most of the jokes were grade bathroom humor . Not much different than a Kevin Smith film . Idiocracy throws away logic reason any intelligence good reason Mike Judges comeback was a knockout .
11930_8.txt,1, Picture this . Someone makes a film about the Columbine or Virginia tech massacre only the film is directed by the guy who did home alone know this is n't but bare with me and stars Sean Astin off of Goonies ! picture the terrorists being overpowered by buckets of water on top of ajar doors and marbles and this is why you need to see the film . unfortunately it does n't go all the way by actually having the skateboard lying on the floor for the evil Mexicans to trip on but its halfway there you have to give it above for that but not a because it did n't go crazy enough . Pity its seemed like it would be comical cheesiness well worth a cult status

He was waiting for me . He was about to start interrogating me until simply told him have no business in Germany I'm just passing through'' He had let me go with the utmost disappointment . That was nothing compared to what happened at Washington Dulles airport was not nearly as bad as what happened to Ibrahimi in the movie The customs officer asked me a couple of questions about the length and purpose of my trip . He then wrote a letter on my custom declaration form and let me go . After picked up my checked bag was stopped at the last exit point Homeland Security crap sat there for hours along with many different people of many different nationalities . was not told the reason for my detainment . was not allowed to use my phone or ANY other phone . was feisty at first asking to be told of the reason or let me go but decided to suck it up and just wait and see . asked if can call my wife to tell her that I'm going to be late but was told no . When tried to use my phone and as soon as my wife said hello'' an officer yanked the phone out of hand and threatened me to confiscate it . When asked about needing to call home because my family is waiting they said Three hours is nothing we will make contact after hours'' When asked to use the bathroom an officer accompanied me there . It toilet was funny guess it was a prison style toilet that is all metal with no toilet seat . Finally they called my name and gave me my passport card and said you can go . asked what the problem was they said nothing'' know it was only hours but was dead tired and wanted to go home to see my wife and kids . As for the movie it was very well made . Unlike most movies that involve Arabs and use non actors who just speak gibberish this movie the Arabic was correct . assume the country is Morocco Africa
532_8.txt,1, I'm sorry but Star Wars Episode did not do any justice to Natalie Portman's talent undeniable cuteness She was entirely underused as Queen Amidala and when she was used her makeup was frighteningly terrible . For Anywhere But Here she sheds her god makeup and she acts normally . And not only can she act good she looks good doing it . I'm a bit older than she only and have little or no chance of meeting her but hey a guy is allowed to dream right ? Even though Susan Sarandon does take a good turn in this movie the film belongs entirely to Portman . I've been a watcher of Portman's since Beautiful Girls'' she was younger but just as cute There's big things for her in the future can see it .
6544_10.txt,1, For those of you out there who have seen this pic on VHS would recommend the DVD . In fact the VHS is utter rubbish . The main reason is that the film was shot widescreen and the producers ran out of money making the VHS version and released it as The result is that several actors are not on screen at all and in many drag races less than half the cars are showing since one is on each side of the screen . The DVD is actually a reasonable version of the film . lot of the best scenes in the film were cut before the final release . They were viewed as being too offensive to minority groups . In fact the prospect of a US release caused even more cuts in the film . For example the Americans reputedly did not understand words such as Petrol Strides . Mike's dad and mum were meant to be hippies . The dad survives in the film as a wasted dope smoking guitarist . But the following scene with the mum was cut . The scene took place in the roof space of the house which was lined with aluminium foil fluoro lights and filled with plants . you get the picture . The producers had rounded up a lot of real plants for the foreground and when they saw the result on the big sheet they freaked and the scene was cut . Cowards ! Yes the film is noted as an Australian cult classic . Voted in Street machines best films of all time narrowly missing out to Mad Max ll . The latter had over times the budget of ROE . In fact the budget on ROE was so small that the director could not afford to wreck any of the cars . even though there would have been a public outcry if anyone had wrecked a real HO . that with Smoky and the Bandit or Blues Bros where dozens of cars were wrecked . So there's one real GTHO and two fakes . One of the fakes was bought from the local indigenous community in Cobar after the standby GTHO crashed into the back of the Country Boy's truck . was unscripted ! The car was meant to burst out from the side of the truck . Because the budget was so tight the car was made up with ordinary brown masking tape instead of the painted on gold trim of the real thing . The chev is absolutely real . The car began as a very plain door and was brilliantly and quickly converted to the blown in the film . The motor was a marinised which made around bhp . This was reduced to around for the filming . The car was able to easily to mph as show in several scenes in the film . Just for the record anyone with could have picked up ALL the cars after the film . The HO the Dodge the Ute Rammer's Chev . the lot . Wonder where they are now ? SW
1881_10.txt,1, Normally do not review online but it's Saturday and I'm trapped in my room on a rainy day with nothing to do but watch sci movies and Xena Warrior Princess ca n't get the damned the Mighty song out of my head it's been there for the past ten years or so just pops up randomly when someone does something idiotic If you have any complaints about this movie and actually post them on the internet do you have ANY idea how much of an idiot you look like ? If you expect more out of Bruce Campbell than what he puts out the most literal sense than why in holy name do you watch his movies ? No one watches a Bruce Campbell movie when they want to see something genius and intelligible we watch them so we feel better about ourselves those people who watch Jerry Springer and eat Chunky Monkey and to be easily entertained by mindless psycho personally love Bruce Campbell movies . I'm not a complete idiot in fact see myself as an intellectual and a scholar shut up Ally His movies reflect insane random quirky ridiculous ideals which anyone with a brain screaming or no can enjoy . That and he was kind of sexy on Xena Warrior Princess even with the facial hair . rate this movie an excellent just because can . If you ca n't take simplistic plot any hot babes in sci splendor spandex and familiar if not exhausted views of insanity then fer cryin out loud do n't watch the movie any that so much as mention the name Bruce Campbell Oh yeah Ted Raimi was awesome in this movie ! Way to go Ted ! You did the best with what you had .
3495_7.txt,1, Anyone who has seen Ali before should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is Indahouse Although prefer Ali when he is interviewing the rich and famous his brand of completely off the wall comedy definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen too . Ridiculous plot ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script that all make this film a riot for fans of Ali If you've seen him and did n't like him then avoid this film like the plague because it's definitely just more of the same for everybody else watch it Aiiii !
6200_8.txt,1, Sleeper Cell is what should have been . is a cartoon . watch but feel cheated with every stupid episode all four or five seasons so far . Who can keep track as they are all the same . Jack gets in trouble Jack gets out of trouble and then immediately gets back in to trouble and then . Sleeper Cell is really well done and is far superior . Unfortunately they blew it with the ending in season two . can think of a half dozen better endings off the top of my head that would have worked better for the writer's obvious goals and not been so contrived . Shame on the writers for wrecking what had been up to that ending a really good series .
5449_7.txt,1, remember this movie getting a lot of flak from reviewers when it was new . Letterman and Leno themselves had objections . Letterman called it the biggest waste of film he'd ever seen and Leno objected to the simpleton portrayal of himself . But Letterman had John Michael Higgins as a guest on his show so it seems he did n't take anything too personally . DVD re with opinions and such from those involved could be interesting though suspect the days when late night talkshow wars captivated the nation are gone and not returning soon . preferred the Letterman impersonation to the Leno but could never buy in to either . They never rose above caricature and never simply accepted them as actors . For comparison Paul Sorvino as Kissinger in Oliver Stone's Nixon'' comes to mind as an impersonation which may have seemed laughable in the first few moments but which seemed at least plausible after the first moments of amusement wore off . The highlight of the show for me was Treat Williams as Michael Ovitz . Williams speech to Letterman was not as great as but reminiscent of Alec Baldwin's entrance quick exit as Blake in Glengerry Glen Ross . They could have done more with Johnny's role in all this . know he was mostly uninvolved in the events portrayed in this movie and most audiences will be familiar with his reputation such that Johnny Carson needs no introduction . But more context about why Dave and Jay and all comedians revere Johnny would have given this flick the substance it lacks in being a gossip film . Guess should read the book . Rich Little imitating Johnny Carson unfortunately came across as nothing more than Rich Little imitating Johnny Carson . tell you what after watching this movie then watching either the Letterman or Leno show all want to do is crack open my Johnny Carson DVDs and see the real thing .

12429_10.txt,1, If you took a really good jack black movie added a little jeepers creepers and then a dash of joyride with a hint of texas chainsaw massacre and house of a corpses . would have MONSTER MAN ! went into this movie not really expecting much at all but wound up really enjoying the movie . the whole premise is really cheesy a monster man in a monster truck chases down people but it is so funny that the writer does n't expect you to take it seriously . justin urich is a comic gem and should have a very promising career . he is identical to jack black . the only problem with the film is the unbelievable hero role played by eric jungmann . but overall if you are looking for a really really fun movie that will crack you up until you are rolling in the aisles and at the same time scare the crap out of you . out this film .

8560_8.txt,1, Of course going into it one would expect it to be a typical stupid flick and it is . But it really does have some fairly well thought out humorous moments . Given the era in which it was made and the obvious exploitation aspect it is still one of the better comedies of the time . While watching this movie you will see quite obviously the inspiration for many of the scenes in Revenge of The Nerds'' and numerous other films of the same genre . Most of the acting is horrible and WAY over the top but that's exactly what expect in a movie like this . What it lacks in the way of acting ability it more than makes up for with its camp value and complete disregard for anything of merit . The amazing thing about this movie is that there was obviously some money that went into it . Films like this made today just do n't have the same style . If you can turn your brain off and turn your sense of humor up for an hour and a half you will enjoy this flick . dare anyone to not find at least SOMETHING in this movie that they think is funny if not hilarious .
4828_8.txt,1, This work is pretty atmospheric with a couple of surprises a few really creepy elements . found this work more rewarding than first expected given the rotten reviews this receives here at IMDb . The dialog comes across as natural and honest the circumstances although the overall run of the film goes from predictable to clich with the heroines falling down when they should be running and investigating strange noises when they should be locking their doors . Typical horror movie fare . The local characters are some of the worst clich depicting Appalachian natives as in developmentally challenged freaks . The characters of the children and the principals are GREAT ! The development given is adequate and Scout Taylor seems to be developing her talents quite well . Now I'm not going to say that this is entirely original or the best thing since sliced bread is n't all that great by the way but this IS interesting and do not long for my minutes back . would not say this is an awesome movie by any means but there are some really good horror elements herein . But there are also some really slow spots where plot development seem superfluous to the director's the film editor's whim . All in all this is good for a rainy night but not so good for a Friday night's viewing . It rates a from . the Fiend
7057_7.txt,1, just saw this for the first time in or years . close to In some ways it was better than remembered . other it was MUCH worse . First of all there's the music . It's just plain awful . There are only songs in the movie most of them used more than once . The opening song is shrieked by a chorus of annoying children and the disco title track is performed by Rick Dees . It does n't get any worse than that . Even the background music is terrible with much of it repeating the themes of the other nauseating tunes . We also get some truly lame slapstick mostly in the opening credits . On the other hand Bill Murray is spot on brilliant as usual . have to wonder if he ad the whole thing or if the writers just gave him all the funny lines . Or maybe he's just that great turning a weak script into comic genius . The best part are his surreal PA announcements . out of here . a menace ! You also get a lot more character development than you have any right to expect in a movie like this . At least half the characters seem like real people . mostly real people you would like to have around . Even Spaz'' gets to do a more than any other Eddie Deezen character ever did and when he gets the girl it's plausible . not absurdly hot but he does n't automatically pair up with one of the nerd girls see Revenge Of The Nerds'' for examples of both cinematic phenomenons . And when the plot seems clich ya got ta wonder if it was n't a clich yet when they made this . While it was n't the first summer camp movie ya got ta go back at least to The Parent Trap'' it's certainly the movie that made it it's own genre . In fact was surprised that there was no Talent Show scene . Hot American Summer'' spoofed the summer genre so perfectly just assumed everything in it came straight out of Meatballs . also half Jon Cryer to pull up in a convertible with a chimp thanks to Mr. Show's'' epic camp spoof Monk Academy'' Anyway this one seems to be vanishing a little as far as the late comedies it's not a cable staple anymore and certainly does n't have the cult following of Caddyshack or Animal House . was pleased to catch it on Showtime today and in High Definition at that ! Sure it's pretty awful in spots but you could do a lot worse in a teen comedy . And again Murray is a genius .
9389_9.txt,1, do love horror films . however am generally not a huge fan of so stupid it's funny'' films . HAD to rate this so highly simply because Death Bed the bed that eats is so one of a kind and so original . there are plenty of question marks plenty of plot holes and the WTF factor is cranked up to but was really not bored for a second . really could n't call it creepy at any point Every minute was saying to myself what the hell is this bed going to do next ! watched this with a friend that is in no way a fan of horror or movies and even she was pretty into it . the effects were actually very inventive and the colors and atmosphere were quite good . it keeps a very consistent and even tone throughout most of the film an incredibly ludicrous consistency and the acting was n't TERRIBLE . can see from the point that there are certain inconsistencies in the actions of the bed that make the suspension of belief damn near impossible but the film itself was such a unique and bizarre concept that that fact did n't really bother me . seriously for me this film hit that realm of one will not only never forget but guarantee will find myself thinking back on certain scenes in the future . does anyone else know of any other films in the inanimate objects that eat people genre ? totally fantastic .
3575_7.txt,1, Jim Varney's performances as the Harem Girl and are amazingly funny a level surpassing Chaplin and Keaton . Linda Kash is great in her once role as the hometown waffle waitress longing for adventure . Unfortunately the remaining of the movie was unwatchably bad due to the atrocious plot . The makers of Ernest Goes to Africa did not rise to the creative challenges inherent in low budget film production . Only worth seeing on cable .
7059_8.txt,1, Camp North Star and it's Camp counselor extraordinaire Tripper Harrison Murray would like to end a decades long losing streak to rival Camp Mohawk an ivy league type place where only the wealthy kids can attend . Meanwhile we watch as Tripper tries his hand at love when he flirts aimlessly with fellow female counselor Roxanne Lynch other teen counselors pair up and also fall head The film comes to head at the Camp Olympiad as the rivals square off in competitive athletic contests with Tripper almost realizing their doomed to fail yet another year . The film also shows the growing bond between Tripper and a quietly lonely puppy eyed Rudy Makepeace of Vamp'' fame whose dad is often away all the time . Rudy does n't seem to fit in with the other kids his age and he seems to spend most of his time either jogging in the mornings with Tripper or taking his peanuts at Blackjack . The film mostly contains hi of fellow teen camp counselors cutting up and goofing around . You have hottie counselors total nerd Spaz Blum his taped glasses and bad acne beak Hardware'' Craven likes to blow things up fat kid Fink Knight who is often stuffing his face amongst others in the film . There's a basketball game where poor Spaz can barely bounce the ball against rival Camp Mohawk much less shoot an accurate shot with poor Fink tossing underhanded between fly that sail over the back There's camp fire coupling a spirited scary tale by Tripper about a hook killer boys drooling over the lovely ladies . Yes know it's desperate at times trying to squeeze out every laugh it can and occasionally indulges in lapses of sentimentality as the scenes with a sad Makepeace and Murray but just as much as this recent viewing found myself giggling away . I'm licked and just ca n't help loving this . It's a summer camp movie through and through which simply wants to entertain you . ca n't explain or reinforce enough the overwhelming joy that floods forth when see a sleepy Murray's hand reach from the covers for the alarm clock that's piercing loudly pronouncing a summer camp movie is about to begin . His intercom jokes are especially amusing . But the flick is let's be honest a series of comic vignettes with Murray dead endlessly . that there's anything wrong with that . The film though could n't quite survive without him could it ? Hard to even think of this movie without Murray in the lead . It's a happier time and think nostalgia of that summer camp experience plays quite a hand in why we grown still connect with Meatballs'' warmly . And poor Morty Atkin the camp head who so badly wants things to run smooth and to beat Camp Mohawk for a change is the constant source of Tripper and gang's amusement as they often play gags on him . when he's sleeping on his bed ! Great enthusiastic cast who seem to be having as much as us .
10944_7.txt,1, Well do n't expect anything deep an meaningful . Most of the fight scenes are pretty decent . The two leading ladies are quite endearing but their lack of HK action background shows at times . The ending maybe lacks something but quite enjoyed it none the less . The cheesy humour is n't probably going to appeal to anyone who has n't watched a bunch of HK films but if your down with that sort of thing and have a couple of hours to fill with something meaningless you could do a lot worse than this . so you could do better but . Certainly on a par with most of the Hollywood blockbuster action drivel .
2962_7.txt,1, After seeing Meredith in Beyond the Prairie'' had to buy another film with her staring . can not believe how she let herself into this teenage flick . It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen . Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on Beyond the Prairie'' It's worth it at any price this one needs to pay you to see . This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman . Perhaps some of her latest might fit but have n't seen them . She has the smile of a Cathrine Bell and eyes of Dana Delany with a much younger body .
7396_7.txt,1, do n't care what anyone says this movie is friggin hilarious . This is the sequel to Jack Frost a movie about a killer snowman . The snowman is created when a convicted serial killer about to be executed is taken to the execution chamber but the truck crashes with a truck carrying DNA manipulation chemicals that make human DNA bond with dirt or in this case snow . The first movie was just boring and eventually the snowman is destroyed by pouring antifreeze on him . Or so they thought . This movie takes place about a year after the second . Some scientists resurrect Jack Frost by mixing the antifreeze with chemicals . No explanation is ever given for why they do this they just do . Meanwhile the sherrif who arrested Frost in the first is going to the Bahamas . Unfortunately the snowman comes with him . This movie has it all . It has talking carrots that can stand up ice cubes that explode when you stick them in your mouth and killer snowballs . Yes killer snowballs . They even say Dada ! like babies . I'll have to give the makers of this credit . The snowballs are some of the cutest little things ever dreamed up . wish that could get one as a pet . Frost finally freezes the island as if a killer snowman has the ability to influence major weather patterns . Then there's the actors . There's Manners the FBI agent from the first movie except here he's wearing an eyepatch . YARR MATEYS SHIVER ME TIMBERS BE AN FBI AGENT ! YARRR ! And then there's the stereotypical British adventurer and the stereotypical black Jamaican with dreadlocks . And finally Captain Fun . The fruitiest man on the face of the planet bar none . This movie is n't scary but is is hilarious . laughed my butt off the whole way through and recommend this for anyone who likes a good bad'' movie . out
3376_8.txt,1, The premise is rather original and well thought but unfortunately siding a good story is very low budget that does n't even allow for decent special effects . Jeff Fahey does his best amongst a poor cast as does the always beautiful Linda Hoffman . They should make more movies together . The movie while not worth much praise warrants at least one viewing .
6319_10.txt,1, While this film might not be the next Evil Dead Hell who knows maybe it will it has only been out for a year It is worth a look . Do n't expect a million film . cuz you'll be disappointed . DO expect to be entertain to laugh and to enjoy the experience . in all this film is MUCH better than many if not all of the low budget horror films out there . have seen films that spent more than or times what this film cost to make and turned out times worse . The effort that was put into this film far out weighs the set backs it faces by having a limited budget . Movies are meant to entertain and this movie sure does that . In fact this film might even open up new doors for you in movie watching . It's available on Netflix if not your local video rental store . So watch it then decide .
6435_10.txt,1, OK. Who ever invented this film hates humanity and wants to see them all slit their throats . This film'' was absolute and utter filth . What the heck was up with the weird old bags eyes ? Seriously was she on some sort of horrible drug and then she like just thought she could control people ? She was running around with her freaking evil eye and it was like what ? Do have a booger hanging out of my nose ? What are you staring at ? Are you like the sea witch or something ? All and all though thought the graphics were top notch old chap . For that alone would give it a ten . But just cover your ears when you are watching it . The pure and complete evil that comes from that film will make your ears bleed and your eyelids fall off . Who knows ? You might even get a knot in your small intestine . You better watch out fools .
10639_10.txt,1, Some users are confused about the identity of the armed men walking down the steps in the Odessa staircase'' sequence . These men are not Cossacks but regular army troops . The Cossacks arrive at the scene a little later and they are the men on horses slashing at the crowd with their sabers . To experts on Russian history Correct me on this if I'm wrong . But there are a couple of lines in the movie that apparently no one has commented on . After the takeover of the Potemkin someone in the crowd on shore says Kill the Jews ! This is on screen for only a couple of seconds but it is there . How cruelly typical of history not just in Russia but in so many other countries to immediately unthinkingly and instinctively blame Jews for any domestic trouble ! Perhaps other parts of the movie are not historically factual but the outcry against the Jews is all too real . Comments anyone ? Also why ca n't speakers of English learn to pronounce the name as Potyomkin'' instead of as Potemkin'' There's a need in Russian to distinguish the two possible pronunciations of as either ye'' or as yo . Sometimes two dots are used to distinguish these two pronunciations but usually the difference simply has to be memorized .
2140_7.txt,1, The Deer Hunter's'' success with critics and publics alike led United Artists to give Cimino carte on Heaven's Gate an epic Western about the Johnson County Wars'' The elliptical story about the persecution of lowly European farmers by Wyoming's cattle was a muddled mixture of class sumptuous pageant and underwritten stereotypical characters'' However Cimino's fetish for authenticity and his sweeping sense of scale ensured that the film running at nearly four hours was rarely tedious'' Its undeserved status as a cause with critics divided as to whether it was a masterpiece or a fiasco derived from its inflated budget'' Blamed for the studio's financial problems Cimino became a scapegoat for Hollywood's general decline and the film edited into an incomprehensible short version after its initial release was a commercial disaster
8664_10.txt,1, Den Brysomme Mannen is one of the better films of all time and is about a man trapped in a world where there are no senses no feelings no Love no Truth and definitely no Freedom . world where people become afraid when someone speaks their mind expresses himself or show affection a world where no one is Free and no one has any idea what the Meaning of any of this is . Just like the world we live in the world in Den Brysomme Mannen is a world of lost souls trying to become fulfilled but focus on the complete opposite of what fulfills them materialism social acceptance and mediocre satisfactions . Den Brysomme Mannen deserves full attention by every human soul because we could all use a fresh Wake Up call .
9916_8.txt,1, rank OPERA as one of the better Argento films . Plot holes and inconsistencies ? Sure but do n't think they impair this film as much as many other reviewers seem to . lot of elements that are in many of Argento's films are kinda off but that's part of the draw of his films . Short story psycho stalks the opera's new leading lady . The typical Argento twists and turns ensue leading up to a decent payoff of a climax . Not Argento's best but still pull this one out from time to time . Definitely worth a look if you like his other stuff just do n't get this one mixed up with the abysmal PHANTOM OF THE OPERA remake that Argento did that one is truly awful .
4124_7.txt,1, First I'm a huge Buddy Holly fan . grew up knowing who he was and knew all about that fateful plane ride that extinguished three incredibly bright flames just like that . But had never truly listened to his music . had heard much of it yes but not until sat down with the intention of getting something out of it did truly come to see the real Buddy Holly . And let me tell you that my world is a different one now because of him . Because of this adoration for such an incredible man bought The Buddy Holly Story without ever seeing it previously . I'm torn on my views of this film . Perhaps it's because Buddy feels so alive to me that just could n't bear seeing Gary Busey in this role . I'll admit that he did a nice job acting but his singing sounded so forced . It seemed to me as if he knew he did n't sound a bit like Buddy himself and therefore was using far too much energy to make an attempt at a similar sound . In some parts of the film he succeeded . But others . ouch . The movie spanned a period of several years but feel that portraying this time span could have been handled much better . had a difficult time distinguishing at what point in Buddy's life certain events were happening . also had a serious problem with some of the historical inaccuracies . think the worst one was the portrayal of the Crickets . understand how their real names could n't be used and how for simplification there were only two of them in the movie . and maybe this was a good thing . Because the film's background vocals were cringe and disliked the way they were portrayed as a hindrance to Buddy's career . Something else that really made no difference to the film but irked me was Gary Busey's teeth . They wore me out ! Buddy Holly had much better teeth . do n't know why noticed it . but did . I'll end this review on what felt was the best part of the movie Buddy's last performance . His final phone call to Maria the Big Bopper's performance bringing him and Richie Valens to the stage followed by the still frame ending . It startled even me and feel that it effectively shows the audience how at one moment Buddy Holly was so alive and energetic and that his flame was snuffed out in the blink of an eye . It was a beautiful way to portray this horrible tragedy think . Good movie despite the obvious problems . Some obvious flaws could use some work . but not bad .
1742_7.txt,1, was really beginning to enjoy this show . It just started out slow and it was n't given the chance it deserved . It is summertime so many people are not at home watching television . know there are a few talent and singing competitions but enjoy them as do many other . believe it or not when American idol is done for the year miss it . Even though this was not American idol thought it had potential . feel bad for the singers on the show who wee really starting to grow on me . wish they would reconsider and put the show back on . think it was a hasty move to cancel . My only complaint about the show is did not care to much for the judges .
3016_8.txt,1, do not want to go into a criticism of the movie which think is for a big budget movie quite exceptional and daring . just wanted to remark that am really fed up with the studios policies and the laws of different states which treat their viewers like children . In the database we find at least different versions of the movie according to running time . But of course it is likely that there are much more different cuts . The result is complete confusion and you can never be sure to talk about the same movie you live in Argentina where the movie runs minutes which sounds quite complete Later on DVD and Video the studios try to rob us further by selling us a presumable director's cut Germany there is already such a version around running approx . minutes It would be nice if the studios would not only think of the cash they make with their movies but also think of their products as a work of art even at the risk of an unfavourable rating so that as a viewer do n't have to feel cheated and am taken seriously not only as a resource of money .
7116_7.txt,1, House of Dracula works from the same basic premise as House of Frankenstein from the year before namely that Universal's three most famous monsters Dracula Frankenstein's Monster and The Wolf Man are appearing in the movie together . Naturally the film is rather messy therefore but the fact that all three monsters are there is usually enough to ensure that the film's sixty seven minutes do n't become boring . It's obvious that the idea of making another monster mash came into the writer's head before an actual plot did as the yarn we're given is n't exactly without holes . The plot sees Count Dracula arrive at Dr. Edelman's home asking for a cure for his vampirism . Then what can only be described as a coincidence sees Lawrence Talbot The Wolf Man turn up asking for a cure for his affliction ! It turns out that Dracula is on the prowl for Edelman's daughter but Talbot really is serious . When it turns out that he ca n't be stopped from turning into a wolf The Wolf Man throws himself into the sea . he ends up finding Frankenstein's Monster . Overall this film is n't as good as the earlier House of Frankenstein . The film put its plot together better than this entry in the series does as the plot here does n't give equal time to each Universal monster . Dracula's plot is the biggest at first but soon fizzles out only to resurface at the end . The Wolf Man is the star of the show but his story never really develops and is essentially just another version of the plot he always finds himself in . Frankenstein's Monster is given the coldest hand as he appears in the movie merely as an afterthought and an obvious excuse to ensure that all three monsters appear in the movie . The story of the doctor who binds all three together is the most interesting but this is a little disappointing as he is n't the reason why people will see this film . The acting is good enough with John Carradine showing his sinister side and Lon Chaney Jr once again making sure that his character is bathed in tragedy . Glenn Strange is given nothing to do and Onslow Stevens proves the real highlight as Dr Edelman . Overall this film wo n't do much for anyone that is n't a fan of Universal horror but as silly monster movies go House of Dracula is worth seeing .
5508_7.txt,1, Everyone told me this movie was downright not good and sick etc . so finally rented it and was amazed thought the torture was gon na be much much worse but it did get shocking near the end but that was about it . would n't call it a horror movie maybe a mystery or something under the category of Silence of the Lambs and Kiss the Girls . It did get stupid at times but the rest of the movie kept me on the edge of my seat . Rated for strong torture violence language and sexuality
3317_8.txt,1, Caroline Bender Lange is just killing time getting a job . Her real ambition is to marry Eddie and have a baby . April Baker is too innocent to stay that way for long and falls in love too easily a dangerous combo . Greg Parker is a go and wants to be an actress . All three are doomed for dramatics in Best of Everything a soap opera play solid movie that is aging by the second . Set in the cut world of paperback publishing its not as trashy as Valley of the Dolls'' but not as vanilla as Three Coins in the Fountain . The men in the mix Brian Aherne Stephen Boyd Louis Jourdan and Robert Evans are slick well and no good for the most part . Aherne is the resident sexual offender will pinch anything walking by and makes unwanted advances right and left . His character is offensive as hell but its not played seriously at all . Harassment had n't been discovered yet guess . Boyd works there too although you never see him actually doing anything . He's too busy being older wiser and drunker . Evans is abroad just so Diane Baker can suffer in style he's a rich kid who's gotten her in so instead of marrying her as promised he's taking her to get an Jourdan is a director who mistakenly has an affair with Parker . They share a fight scene which is fairly no barred in a movie like this anyway but the scene is ultimately ruined by Parker's histronics . She ends up nearly stalking him and she really did n't deserve such a lousy fate her bad acting notwithstanding . Joan Crawford breathes fire as Amanda Farrow the resident who is automatically rude and dismissive of any of her legion of secretaries . Well they are younger are n't they ? Is n't that sufficient reason to hate a person ? Caroline does n't think so as she admirably stands up to Miss Farrow every chance she gets . Crawford only gets to let loose once when she tells her married boyfriend can your rabbit wife can both go to hell and slams down the phone . You never get to see the poor soul who dare crosses her . Martha Hyer's as it were is extremely weak and she is painfully over as an unmarried mother . Short of wearing a huge on her cardigan she walks around like a pathetic mess for most of her screen time . Even worse she is not given the courtesy of having it all up one way or the other at the end . It wo n't matter that much but still . Its painfully obvious this all took place in a totally different world . People were nicer to one another for the most part and work was not a drag but something exciting for a girl from outside NYC anyway . One unconvincing drunk scene aside Hope Lange helps it seem reasonably real as Caroline who at least has more than one side to her character . admire that women are seen having an opinion a chance and a choice . Not that its not wrapped in a nice bow but it makes some points for equality . In that was probably noteworthy and possibly controversial .
10499_8.txt,1, There's not much anyone can say about this flick . plot is quite simple Two police officers also happen to be lovers are using a brothel as a stakeout in order to catch a criminal with the help of the lady of the house'' played by hardcore pornstar Chloe . As anyone can guess there's a few plot twists and some blurred alliances but the writing was just horrible even for a softcore movie . I've read some previous posts about Nicole Hilbig's accent plays the female cop Yes it's hard to understand what she's saying at times but think I've placed it . did some sniffing around . think she's from Germany hence her odd accent . She makes an impression even without speaking however . got a great looking body . There were a couple of from behind'' sex scenes in this movie that were quite graphic for a softcore film . work there . The three scene toward the end was n't bad either . ALERT kinda knew the female cop was gon na turn into a part call girl at the end . She enjoyed her three WAY too much . SPOILER I'm not gon na nitpick about the story TOO much seeing as this is a low direct softcore flick . However it just seems like I've seen way too many movies in this genre with a similar type of storyline . Women and Hilbig were okay as the eye Sex were kinda short but good Story recycled plot but whatever works eh ? Overall
4583_8.txt,1, This must be the dumbest movie I've ever seen and therefor it deserves a special award . OK so it begins pretty good logical humor and then rapidly changes to complete and utter uh stupidity that makes total sense . The strange thing is that hardly laughed at it though guess it is supposed to be funny with a very serious message . After a moment of thought why did n't laugh the answer was pretty clear . this movie is a lot more realistic then would like it to be . So it is extremely dumb yet very wise if the object was to reach people which are n't with a whole lot of neurons and synapses and electrolytes electrolytes ? This movie might actually be understood at some level by a big audience ! Although they probably just laugh . Ah well nice try . am now editing adding to my comment cause read some of the other comments . First noticed some people see racism in this movie . Well that did not at all cross my mind when watching it . However can imagine if you are looking from that perspective you will see some . We could of course debate the link between intelligence and race but think this is not the place to do so . wonder if we were to rate the Huxtable family here would you complain about them all being black ? do n't think so but guess you could . from that from the wisest people in the world half the woman does n't seem totally caucasian to me so the problem is ? Secondly the movie gets very mixed ratings from to and everything in between but a lot of polarisation there which means the movie does its job very well ! It stirrs people up makes them want to speak about it and judge it . That means it is a good movie whether you like it or hate it . After minutes it becomes very predictive and boring even yet you keep watching this utter crap . guess you keep hoping that it is n't so . Or maybe it's our sick way to look at terrible accidents . Well this is one for sure .
4570_7.txt,1, Caught this recently after noticing James Earl Jones name on the title . It was better than expected . Of course it's pretty old made during the early but it actually is a decent drama . It runs a quick or so and showcases good performances from James Earl Jones and Diahann Caroll . The plot is conventional in general but told through the perspective of a single black woman on welfare who has children and trying to deal with all the problems that persist . This makes for an interesting view . in the fact that the script was n't too sentimental or overdramatized it's almost like looking at a slice of the past . All the styles are out in abundance . The ending is kind of kooky though . would've done better without the theatrics .
10421_8.txt,1, agree with the Aussie's comments for the most part . However there id seem to be a fairly decent plot if unoriginal . Christina McCarty inherits a rural property that she intends to open a mountain lodge . She gets reacquainted with Chip Johnston whom she had known when she was growing up in there . The plot thickens when James Logan arrives with his new stripper friend Shene Lane because Christina had been James stripper friend in years gone by and the implication is that James had done her wrong somehow . To add interest to the movie Sophia Linn Parent a romance novelist shows up as a guest at the lodge as do Eric Guy and Linda pair of lawyers from the city . James sicks the local building codes inspector on Christina's business as one of his dirty tricks to shut her down . So the question is How far will James go to sabotage the lodge and will he succeed ? Watch for Devinn Lane here and in Beauty Betrayed . She seems to be making a transition from the hard core business to the world . Another notable is Samantha McConnell playing the role of Bait clearly the most outrageous character name in the movies !
3621_10.txt,1, Incredibly hilarious mid Italian Rootsploitation with lots of non lesbian sex gratuitous racial cruelty etc . redeeming cinematic qualities except for the fairly cool theme music with dubby African'' drums and flute . Brilliant sample dialog White Slave Owner White Plantation Manager You're so dumb I'll bet you forgot to interrogate that midwife ! White Plantation Manager Not only did interrogate her did it so well she died before could get any answers from her ! All the black actors have afros and say yes massa'' in a high voice . The female lead has sex with everybody on the plantation . Stars for fans of tasteless sleaze .
1085_9.txt,1, really realistic sensible movie by Ramgopal Verma No stupidity like songs as in other Hindi movies . Class acting by Nana Patekar . Much similarities to real
904_10.txt,1, Genius or utter madness ? That depends on your interpretation of this film . responded to it on the level of a self cop parody'' and sincerely hope that was the intention as do n't see anyone taking it seriously ! Paul Rudd for one seems to be chewing up the scenery and really getting into the spirit of things ! Is this film supposed to mark a departure for Rudd from his core background in the comedy genre ? Some kind of insane attempt to reinvent him as a hard action star ? think not ! With the cheesy almost awkward acting low budget FX and zany over action set pieces it all kinda evoked that old TV show Sledge Hammer'' for me ! HILARIOUS ! Of course may have totally interpreted the film wrong . If it was in fact an attempt at a action movie then it was certainly an amusing failure ! Watch with lots of alcohol and some mates !
12224_9.txt,1, am continuously amazed at the US networks . What is the matter with them ? Yet another very very promising series axed after just episodes and we are left not knowing what the hell happens to everyone . really thoroughly enjoyed this show and am so annoyed that we will never find out what happens to the characters and the from the deep . This show had everything . Humour suspense action . What more could you want . Why oh why did the pull the plug on this ? It just does n't make sense . Buffy went on for series as did Charmed and enjoyable as they were Surface Invasion and Dead Like Me were even better . Just because a show does not get terribly high ratings does n't mean it's rubbish and if they gave it a bit longer probably more people would catch on to it and they would end up with a big hit on their hands . One season just does not give it enough time to catch on and the networks are far to eager to pull the plug . They should learn that like fine wines and cheeses they take time to mature . Bring Surface and Invasion back
711_10.txt,1, Peter Strauss by nature of appearing in mini and made films often gets an unfairly high proportion of bad reviews Usually from casual observers who saw ten minutes of the film having channel into it half through . Well I've just read all the other reviews for this film and am delighted to see not a single bad word said about The Jericho Mile That should be enough to have you blasting out to buy this film ! Peter Strauss won an Emmy for his role in this film and watching it even once will show you why he deserved it so much . Looking to be objective attempted to criticise this film . Instead found myself arguing down every one of my possible nit This is what true realistic film is about . This is not your typical Hollywood sensationalism where everything is overacted It's so realistic and true to life that people have thought it's based on a real event !
10081_10.txt,1, Is this a bad movie ? Of course what were you expecting from a movie called BEACH BABES FROM BEYOND'' It is a BABES in BIKINI'' movie and has no pretensions of being otherwise . Given this is not ROOM WITH VIEW'' or SCHINDLER'S LIST . If you wanted a film like Room With a View'' then you would not be looking at Beach Babes from Beyond . But if you are looking for a good Babes in Bikini movie with almost no plot this is the one for you . This flick delivers on what it promises and then some . It is pure adolescent fun . There were lots of BABES in and out of bikinis . The movie was quite funny and great to watch . These were some of the most beautiful women have ever seen on home video . Every high school kid should watch at least one bad movie like this . This is actually one of the most memorable movies have ever seen . So unashamedly say again . you are going to watch only one Babes in Bikini'' movie this is it .
1877_7.txt,1, Or if you've seen the Evil Dead'' trilogy and Bubba Ho then you should know that his movies are total farces . With Man with the Screaming Brain'' he goes all out again . In this case he plays smarmy American businessman William Cole visiting Bulgaria when do we ever get to see that country ? when a woman kills him . So strange scientist Ivan Ivanov Keach replaces half of Cole's brain with the brain of a former KGB agent leaving him acting sort of like Steve Martin in All of Me'' Yes the whole movie is pretty much an excuse for pure nonsense . Much of the real humor comes from Evil Dead'' director Sam Raimi's brother Ted as Ivanov's nearly brain assistant Pavel . The two men have a relationship more like Laurel and Hardy or Gilligan and the Skipper . So just understand that this is a totally silly movie and you wo n't be a bit disappointed . liked it anyway .
1940_9.txt,1, just glanced over another comment posted here in which the writer discusses the disturbing ways the teenagers in this film use the body of their dead friend . one overlooked in this statement is perhaps the most unsettling of them all no surprise it's what crispin glover's character does . he is thrilled over one of his friends murdering another friend of his the killer's girlfriend . not because layne did not like this individual rather he is excited about her death because it gives him something to do . this poor boy is bored in life and dead inside that a murdered friend is something to get excited about because it provides him with something to focus on .
11969_10.txt,1, Scary in places though the effects did leave something to be desired unless you have bad eyesight or are afraid of the dark . However most of the acting was convincing and most of the effects were well done . thought the creature looked a bit too much like a man in a gorilla suit for my liking . It reminded me of the original pink panther film .
8447_10.txt,1, work at a nuclear power plant so am getting a kick out of these replies . Seriously do . Go to http and you can see where work . could not think of a safer industry to work in . We are required by procedures to report events as minor as paper cuts . Any issue identified as being a potential concern with respect to nuclear radiological or industrial safety is immediately reported in the corrective action process . Bottom line is that nuclear plants in the US operate with safety in the front of their mind .
10228_10.txt,1, I'd love to see some tie between NightBreed The Fury and the Series sort of the way the second Outer Limit's Series would tie particular stories and plot after the fact to create a Story Arc although one was never intended . I'd also like know if some more information anecdotal or otherwise exists anywhere about the relationship and collaboration between Clive Barker and David Cronenberg . simply ca n't get my mind around the fact that David Cronenberg appeared as a mere actor in a Clive Barker film . Does any additional information on the subject actually exist ? Finally it's been years since the film was released and had hoped there would've been a sequel by now . Does anyone out there know if there were any plans in the making that never came to fruition or if in fact there are plans even now for a sequel ?
6856_7.txt,1, To me Anatomie'' is certainly one of the better movies have seen . do n't think Anatomie'' was primarily intended to be a horror movie but a movie questioning the ethics of science . If you watch it with that in mind it turns into a really good film . The only annoying bit was the awful voice dubbing for the English version . How can you expect any non person to listen to these unbearable German accents for two hours ? Let native English speakers do the talking or use subtitles instead !
1228_7.txt,1, I'm not here to tell you Armored'' is Kubrickian Hitchcockian or Fellini Nope . Referenced directors are more like Don Siegel Varrick'' and Walter Hill Warriors'' Those two helmers did n't fool around with niceties like putting women in their movies . No skirts need apply . They unapologetically made guy movies . Guns lots of guns . Men met violent death with a twitch of the jaw . Their movies were like a sap to the head . You want a friend ? Get a dog . Armored'' is so a guy movie . Dueling armored trucks ? Bloody gunshot wounds ? Exploding money ? If that does n't get the lizard part of your brain excited then stay away . At minutes Armored'' is all muscle without an ounce of fat . We meet six security guards who drive armored trucks three per truck . The six led by Matt Dillon scheme up a fake hijack involving two trucks . Their mission one day is to deliver million from the federal reserve think The idea is to drive both trucks to a warehouse stash the cash then stage a hijack . Sure the cops will suspect them but if they stick together they'll get through it . Trouble is one of the six played by Columbus Short is a holdout . At first . But he faces eviction . And he's the guardian for his messed up younger brother . He needs cash bad . Matt Dillon cajoles pleads persuades the holdout . No blood on anyone's hands . clean getaway . All good no bad . You'll be rich forever . Blue skies smiling at you Right . Everything goes to hell of course . It's one damned thing after another and the stakes keep going up . And it almost all happens claustrophobically inside an abandoned warehouse somewhere in Los Angeles . In fact the movie goes out of its way to project a backdrop of industrial urban decay . happen to like industrial urban decay . Kudos to Matt Dillon who plays the top bad dog . He goes from charming to disappointed to frustrated to outraged to totally effing insane in the course of the movie . Love that guy . Also credit is due to the menacing throbbing blistering and totally sinister electronic soundtrack by John Murphy . am guessing he's heard a few Tangerine Dream records . Also it's surprising that this is a PG movie . caught one one ! in this entire movie about violent tough robbers . On some level like that . Take the kids . The director is Nimrod Antal a Hungarian who made a fine noir set in the Budapest subway system called Kontroll . Screenwriter is an out guy called James Simpson . lot of the people in this movie are just starting out . am willing to bet the esteem given to this movie will rise as time goes on and these filmmakers advance in their careers .
5062_7.txt,1, came out of Rendition'' with a list of flaws a mile long so how is it that my overall impression is that it was a pretty decent movie ? It's definitely a film whose sum is better than its parts . Those parts include a cast of big name stars not one of them giving a memorable performance Metwally a relative unknown is the one you'll remember serviceable if undistinguished direction and a screenplay that's both too complicated and too simplistic at the same time . Metwally is an Egyptian American citizen who gets kidnapped by the government's rendition program otherwise known as the process by which America tortures suspected terrorists into confessing information whether or not it's remotely true . Reese Witherspoon plays his pregnant wife who calls in the favor of an old college friend Saarsgard who works for a senator Arkin and helps to track her husband down . Meryl Streep plays the head of the rendition program Jake Gyllenhaal is a young agent assigned to the interrogation and whose conscience gets in the way . Meanwhile a whole parallel storyline follows the daughter of a top Egyptian official who is allied to the American rendition program and her boyfriend who's in training to become a suicide bomber . Ay that's a lot of plot to pack into a two movie and was about to wash my hands of the whole thing especially the Egyptian Romeo and Juliet subplot that felt like nothing more than a distraction . But then near the film's finale a twist of chronology brings all of the plot strands together in a way that makes you want to reassess everything you thought you knew about the motivations of the various characters and makes Rendition'' a much more interesting movie than it seems like it's going to be . Witherspoon Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard all look like high school students playing adults twenty years older than they actually are Gyllenhaal in particular usually a fine actor looks so bored that you wonder if he's going to muster the energy to deliver his lines . And the screenwriter should be arrested for having an actress as good as Meryl Streep at his disposal and giving her nothing more to work with than this one dragon lady . The movie of course strives for relevancy but instead of addressing the tangled web of arguments surrounding the national security issue it charges right down the middle of the debate in a predictable fashion . There are moments when you think maybe the film will veer off in an interesting direction what if Witherspoon did actually begin to doubt her husband's past for instance ? What if Metwally actually had been in contact with terrorists as his interrogators accuse ? But no the movie takes the path of least resistance . But like said upfront recommend this movie . know I've done nothing but list a bunch of its faults but it's got its head in the right place and it is entertaining or at least as as entertaining as a movie about torture and interrogation can be . Grade
8308_10.txt,1, Shame on you if you give this film a low rating . How can you not like a film that has Doug McClure Peter Cushing silly rubber monsters fights for the guys that woman that was the baddie's henchwoman in The Spy Who Loved Me and one of the seventies Sinbad films not wearing very much of whom my mother said She was n't picked for the colour of her eyes'' lava silly wigs and a daft Victorian drilling machine very much like the one used in the old Thunderbirds series ? Whoever watched this film and slagged it off was watching it for the wrong reasons . It may be crap but is definitely good crap . They do n't make like they used to sigh .
3913_8.txt,1, think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a football game or they do n't want to leave their car to get stripped'' deserves whatever happens to them . The guy Wade who went to a barbershop and asked for the He haircut'' was n't my type but there's this really cute scene of him having his eyebrows and facial hair waxed . That's a little too high for me . Also fun but not my type is the fat guy in the big sunglasses who looks like Elton John only gayer but that whole plot goes nowhere ! Blake was hot could see myself with him if he was n't so into his girlfriend who is a phony Paris Hilton in a bad wig Chihuahaua in her handbag but that would have been really precious do n't think girls who look like that go to football games anyways . Nick the car thief is the sexiest ! One of the best parts is where a football lands by him and instead of throwing it back he chucks his cigarette down and it burns the football . See that's just the kind of guy he is . He has a sister who looks dumb borrowing his white wife Her bra straps are showing for like the movie ! Mostly you will just want to wax your legs and not ever go to football games after seeing this .
4191_10.txt,1, This all masterpiece is about the Monkees becoming aware that they are fictional characters in a movie and that everything they do or say had already been written in an script they seem to be following . Head was written by Jack Nicholson Rafelson and Peter Tork during a three LSD trip in a suite at an expensive Hollywood hotel . The other three Monkees only acted in it . They fight this every way they can by doing things not in the script . They deliberately flub their lines walk off sets tear up scenery punch other actors for no reason and ultimately commit suicide by jumping off a bridge . For instance in the rapid flashes of a psychedelic party scene if you watch frame you can see Rafelson sitting next to the camera and cameraman very deliberately shooting into a mirror . He is revealing that the party is actually fake and is being shot in a studio with actors who suddenly drop out of character and walk away in the middle of a conversation when the Director yells cut ! The Monkees however never drop out of character because those characters are also who they really are . That ends up being the core of the Revelation soon to come . At every turn they realize their increasingly actions were exactly what they were supposed to do in the scripted film they ca n't escape being in . You say they went crazy and walked through the sky turns out to be painted on paper and hung from the ceiling as the set's background No problem ! Hey hey they're the Monkees and those wacky guys just keep monkeying around ! In the end even their deaths did not set them free . That was how the movie was supposed to end and their motionless waterlogged bodies are fished out of the river put in another box and stacked in a film studio warehouse until the characters are needed again for another studio production . This is made all the more poignant by the fact that the Monkees really ARE fictional characters who forced themselves into the real world . They did it through the power of their music . Ironically near the end Peter Tork has what he rightly sees as a hugely profound revelation that solves their problem but unfortunately no one listens . Peter realizes It does n't MATTER if we're in the box film He means that it does n't matter if will is free or illusory and that the only important thing is that you just let the present moment occur and occur . You need to just let HAPPEN as it happens'' without analyzing or evaluating or judging whether the experience is valid'' by some abstract definition . When you ca n't even tell the difference will being free or not does n't matter to figure out if you are the real'' you is just a pointless waste of time . saw this film at a very important time in my life . was trying to figure out how to escape being just that geeky creepy nerd girl'' by thinking about it intensely instead of just having fun sex like everyone else did . But the revelation in Head broke my self recursive trap and helped me more than Rafelson or Nicholson or Tork will ever know . For decades I've watched Head'' and wished could thank Pete . Was this a good movie ? Uhh how about like . YES
6939_10.txt,1, Governments are elected for three year terms as Reg Whithers said in the Liberals were determined to continue forcing Labor to the Polls until they were defeated . If you ask me this is portrayed in the docudrama but anyone who says Kerr acted properly in this fails to acknowledge the self and costly strategy of the Liberal Party of Australia . On the series itself though Max Phipps was a poor Whitlam his voice was too ghostly . Also more of the key political players on both sides should have been used though this may have been a reflection of budgetary constraints at the time . Nevertheless recommend it with caution .
3355_9.txt,1, saw this fine flick shortly leaving college . As sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to sexual adventurer got to wondering why her sexual encounters seemed familiar . Then remembered Intro Psych Lecture ! One of the lectures dealt with the Psycho Stages of Developement basically the shift over time on what part of the body and its attendant stimulations gets our main attention as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure . Alice's first encounter is being bathed with emphasis on the genitals and bottom . Her next encounter is an oral one with the Mad Hatter's dingaling . forget the rest of the lecture and the order of Alice's encounters but do remember how well they matched . It's interesting to see a skin flick with some brains behind it rather than the cliche I'm here to deliver your pizza . Let's screw . do n't see how Kristin DeBell's career could be wrecked by this film as it was her first film . And Reagan's tiresome hypocrisies had yet to mar this land when it was released but in a way he and his stooge Meese did affect Ms DeBell . When Meese was staging his anti commission distract people from his own criminal activities Meese hired the services of an anti activist named Judith Reisner . Reisner was obsessed with images she perceived as child pornography . She saw the Alice'' cover Ms DeBell did for Playboy and promptly announced she had scientifically proven that Ms DeBell was in fact a photo collage of parts from several grown women and the face of a ten year old . Yeah right .

Matt's mothers a alcoholic who repeatedly embarrasses him in front of his friends Amy's mother had a bad reputation herself got pregnant with Amy at a a young age . Matt falls in love with Amy tries to straighten out his life for her . Very predictable ending . The actress that plays Amy'' is actually years old trying to play a teenager !
10569_7.txt,1, Historical drama is one of the areas where the British just ca n't be beat . So while i'm not a huge fan of the genre can usually be persuaded to watch something lite this if it's British and with decent actors . have never read anything by Sarah Waters which is of course something should do . Hence did n't really know what to expect from this . had heard that there would be a lesbian love story but not much more . While watching it found it to be a lot more interesting than had anticipated . Without saying too much the twists and turns of the plot are unexpected as well as well Although there were almost a twist too many somewhere it took me a minute to get everything straight . Production values are good the actors are very solid and the pace is decent although found it to be a bit slow in the last half That might just be me though usually have a problem with movies dragging on after the plot is more or less finished . All in all though this is a fairly enjoyable three hours . recommend it to anyone interested in historical dramas .
10259_10.txt,1, Read This BOYZ THE HOOD IS SCENE COMPLETE RIP OF THIS MOVIE . Two friends in the hood one's focused on intellectual pursuits and the other is an athlete . The friend who's an athlete gets involved with the wrong people and gets killed . athlete just happens to be Washington from Back Kotter It makes me mad that people do n't know this . It blows my mind everytime go into a video store and Boyz the Hood is in the section while Cooley High is in It's an embarrassing disgrace . This movie is both funnier and more dramatic than John Singleton's rip At least Singleton could have had the dignity to speak out that his film was homage to Cooley High but no he never said a word . Boys Men however named their hit record after this film .
6485_10.txt,1, the beat is too strong we're deaf mutants now them'' Rex Voorhas Ormine am surprised that this movie has been uniformly bashed . Let me be the first to actually discuss the virtues of The Beat'' and why YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM NOW . Make no mistake this movie is cheesy and bad'' in the conventional sense the story is preposterous the poetry is silly and the acting is inconsistent . But these are the film's CHARMS of these ingredients form the recipe for one of the most UNDERAPPRECIATED CHEEZY FILMS of the If the reference to deaf mutants'' did n't pique your interest then perhaps this will What kind of name is Rex Voorhas Ormine'' anyway ? It is such an unusual name North American audiences that said to myself even the names of the characters in this friggin movie are firggin silly . Well The Beat'' is so fabulously cheezy that the meaning'' and symbolism'' behind Rex Voorhas Ormine'' is revealed not by Bart Waxman misguided guidance counselor you love to hate wo n't spoil the revelation behind Rex's name but please do n't get too excited Overall the acting is inconsistent Savage plays the concerned teacher'' Mr. Ellsworth is pretty good as is the fellow playing Bart Waxman but the rest of the cast are unconvincing That said the acting does NOT detract from the film . Why ? There is a SINCERITY in each of the actors performances that makes the characters they play endearing . So although the performances may suck you are still left with the impression that the actors are really trying to do their best . As a result the actors sincerity succeeds where their acting fails is quite often The homage to beat poetry'' in this film is bad bad bad . But this is a good good good thing when it comes to entertainment . Would you actually enjoy better quality'' or more respectable'' poetry in a film like this ? Folks that would be BORING about the droll they made us read in high school to avoid corrupting the youth'' politically conservative and devoid of any critical analysis etc . Even if you do n't like poetry or arty'' movies all of the intellectual'' posturing that implies you most certainly can should appreciate LUDICROUS POETRY in a WANNABE ART FILM ! How could you not enjoy the following ? do you remember the roar of the dinosaur ? a woman's scotty craps on the floor bad scotty bad oh the woman's so sad she washes her hands and then waits by the door today yeah Yes that is an example of some of the remarkable poetry liberally sprinkled throughout The Beat . But what about the story you ask ? Well the story is preposterous . But then again that is the beauty of this film . Apart from some cliches stereotypes and predictable plot points there are enough genuinely unique elements to the plot to keep things interesting . Who is Rex ? Where did he come from ? What the heck is he talking about ? Deaf mutants ? Illiterate angels ? Do Billy and Kate REALLY understand what Rex is saying ? Is the audience supposed to understand Rex and his poetry posse ? seen the movie several times and still have n't figured everything out . Will bad poetry and high school talent shows really END GANG VIOLENCE ? guarantee that you have never seen anything quite like The Beat'' perfect combination of brilliantly bad poetry mediocre acting and a mythopoetics conquers gang violence'' storyline that has YET TO BE RIVALLED BY ANY FILM EVER MADE . Bonus for fans of classic NYC hardcore The Cro make a rare film appearance as the Iron Skulls'' and it's a hoot to see them perform several songs . wish they included more concert footage but maybe that will be an extra'' included on the collector's edition'' DVD fantasize about .
833_7.txt,1, After seeing Undisputed knew what to expect from Isaac Florentine . The Shepherd Border Patrol is a decent flick Van Damme's best but definitely not his worst . There is some bad acting from VD's supporting cast but it makes sense . The storyline and plot has all been done before so it's nothing new . mean this is Van Damme . We do n't really expect much of an amazing plot do we ? So lets talk about what we all want to watch this movie for anyway the fighting . Without giving anything away thought the way the fights were filmed and shot were well done way better than a few of VD's recent movies such as Second in Command in which the entire end fight is HORRIBLE . With Florentine behind the camera and if you've seen Undisputed he seems to know how to photograph fights and enjoys it . few of the fights in The Shepherd reminded me of VD's older stuff which is what we all want to see . The fights were good and said hah awesome'' out loud a few times . But was hoping for just a bit more considering how good thought Undisputed was . Something found intriguing was VD's daughter in the film thought wow she's kinda hot'' come to find out its Bianca Van Varenberg JC's real life daughter . have never seen her before so that was a nice treat . All in all this movie is not half bad . Yeah the story has been done before but at least JC was attempting to make a good movie . Next time though add more hand to hand combat ! think He still has what it takes to do another big budget movie . acting has improved since he's been doing DTV's and he really is in great shape at do n't know about you but I'm one of the ones who thinks that most of his DTV's are actually good with the exception of Derailed . All he needs to do is get back into bloodsport'' shape and make a martial arts movie . think people would respond well even though he's not jet Li . This movie is definitely worth the rental .
2619_10.txt,1, i'm not going to ramble on about it but i'm just going to make it brief . basically for those who do n't know how prue actually died . the first time round the demonic assassin comes hit piper and prue with an energy ball they fly through the wall blood everywhere . phoebe the third sister comes down the stairs says the spell which send him away but not vanquished . THE POWER OF THREE comes heals them both and so on . they get exposed along the line and the only way the can be saved is for a demon named tempus to turn back time . the only way he can do that is is phoebe stays in the underworld . she agrees tempus turns back time . it now around in the morning again . demon comes strucks piper and prue with energy ball . they fly through wall again . but this time phoebe is n't there to say the spell to fend demon off . demon kills doctor . doctor flies through window . he is dead . demon goes in a whirl wing type thing and glass on the doors shatter which is a great effect bye the way and there is and airy sound . thats where it ends . NOW . what the whole world does n't know if they did n't pay attention to the next episode . although what i'm about to say was n't shown its what happens trust me . because this time there was no phoebe to call for leo this time he arrives later . piper survives because her injuries wer n't as fatal as prue's and leo heals her first before prue so by that time prue is already dead . there mystery solved . ps calling for prue with a spell should have worked ! and she should have made a surprise appearance in the last ever episode . did ramble on
2718_9.txt,1, This is how interpreted the movie First things first . There was not a single scene in the movie where see the bad guy torturing or nailing Ben's hands to the wall . However the same can not be told of the gals . In the end too see Taylor disappear as he walks . Looks like the message there was There was no Taylor'' And the whole movie was a figment of imagination of Ben . Also there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as Ben . It was Taylor all the time . But in real Taylor was Ben . If they were two different people then why was there no scene showing both of them in one frame during the horrific times ? But of course before that do see both of them together and THAT cud just be Ben's imagination at work . Also when Ben was out of jail the text on screen clearly says that Ben's story was unrealistic and there was no such place as he had explained mine cars etc . after Liz Hunter leaves Kristy and comes back to find Ben she does n't find him . Why ? Because Ben was out looking for the gals . Instead Kristy has all the time in the world to check out Taylor's Web cam photos etc . Somehow everything sums up to just one fact that Kristy and Liz both of them knew that Taylor was Ben . So my conclusion is that Ben was schizophrenic and the movie where you see him and Taylor in one frame was nothing but figments of his imagination . Otherwise if there really was a Taylor then they should have found him out given all the detailed explanation coming from Ben .
3371_9.txt,1, The Box is one of the strangest movies have ever seen . To explain my experience let me use this word picture Imagine that you have been binging on pixie sticks and paint fumes for the last month while watching nothing but Twilight Zone reruns . The resulting coma lands you in a hospital where the nurse seems to get a kick out of shooting adrenalin into your IV . The dream that you have while in the coma will be something like this movie . SUMMARY man shows up at the door of a couple . He gives them a box with a button on it . Press the button they will get a million dollars in cash and a person they do n't know will die . I'll try not to spoil anything but from there things devolve into a plot so intertwined and complex and purely original that it will make you question your sanity . But hey most of us have been sane for a while now and change is good . PROS Amazing storyline overall good acting not a slow moment once it gets going . It asks questions of human morality that are rarely if ever asked in popular culture . This movie is deep it has meaning . Its not summer blockbuster special effects fluff that there's anything wrong with that this movie had a relatively low budget and it showed in some places . But think it is perhaps that very thing that makes me like it so much . CONS The first twenty minutes before it gets going are really quite slow . At the end of the movie you will be so confused that you just have to sit down and think for a good half hour . can guarantee that this movie will not get rave reviews from your peers or most critics it is far too strange and there are n't explosions every three seconds . In fact there are no explosions of any kind in this movie your brain popping from trying to understand exactly what the heck just happened Personally do n't think this is a bad thing but many will . RATING Easily a have never had an experience like watching this movie . The only reason ca n't give it a is that it is just too wrapped up in itself . There are several large things left unexplained at the end that are still bugging me as sit here writing this . But overall this is the best experience have had in a movie theater in quite a long time . But be warned you will not like this movie if you ca n't sit back turn on your suspension of disbelief to about and prepare your brain to do some impressive acrobatics . Visit www . for more reviews
11009_10.txt,1, It is an interesting fact that metaphysics by Platon and Aristoteles formal logic and abstract ontology form about those sciences that most people are not interested in . But then around one thousand years after Aristoteles the computer began to usurp the human thinking and the humans who were refusing to reflect questions of being other than biological physical and chemical ones suddenly felt paralyzed because they could not cope with the consequences that this computers would bring over night'' Fassbinder's Welt Am Draht'' together with Tarkovsky's Solaris'' and Godard's Alphaville'' is probably the first movie who took the philosophical questions of emerging computer science as a basis of a story to be told in a movie . The confusing questions about identities and realities are cleverly built into different interwoven criminal stories which the audience really tries to follow because it is interested to solve the cases . Fassbinder was a master to sell highly abstracts contents to his public by embedding theoretical knowledge into practical appetizing forms . The basis problem to understand is that an identity defines a reality but on the other side a reality also requires identity in order to be perceived . The idea of a person with multiple identities is known to us solely from the standpoint of psychiatry . However logically spoken the only reason why we have just one identity is the fact that our logic has only two values and false Now take a logic with just one more value with three Then as you can easily see you have already three identities . What happens now when let us say Dr. Stiller gets killed ? Then it is quite possible that only one of three identities is abolished and the other two remain and are able to rescue the individual from death . Another question is if a person with multiple identities actually feels these identities at once . The idea however to display such sets of identities in a up or down way as shown in the scene with the elevator in the hotel is misleading since identities and hence realities are not structured in Hierarchical but in a Heterarchical way . Strictly speaking there is no artificial identity'' either since each identity is defined over two objects who share all of their features with one another . Therefore the idea of assuming that every individual has just one single identity is nothing but a consequence of ancient two logic either second identity would imply that a person at the same time exists and not But now look around and see that one and the same object is by definition self is perceived by every subject in its own way . If therefore every subject sees an object differently why should it no be possible for the single individual to open the borders of his two individuality with the effect that different persons can exchange their different Individualities ? Fassbinder would five years later pick up this topic in his masterpiece Despair . trip into the light''
9810_10.txt,1, SPOILER NOTHING BUT SPOILER have to add my name to the list of folks who feel that the other viewers just do n't get it . But no one has even mentioned the word so far as have seen . While agree that the kid died think we can be more specific he committed suicide . He races down the slope in an old wagon shoots off the cliff and . away'' Maybe the whole account of the form of death is allegory or maybe he does commit suicide in a wagon as laid out . In either case he flies away'' not that tough a metaphor Maybe just have a thing for Tom Hanks but was ok with the narration . Besides he is raising for the WW memorial and you got ta love him for that . Oh yeah loved the movie and found it incredibly moving .
4331_8.txt,1, Death Wish brings back Charles Bronson as one time vigilante Paul Kersey retired . long Kersey is back to his old ways . this time not just a few muggers at a time a gang who have taken over a run down part of the city York again the way . time its war Kersy Hauls out the big guns for this . body count int his one rivals anything Stallone or Schwarzenegger have come up with . movie is actually somewhat fun to watch for a few one liners and of course bad guys die get severely injured in creative ways is always a good thing . violence is not as personal in this one on a much grander scale of like bombing your victims from afar than one on one combat . movie is lighter in tone than the it easier to watch . not much import to this film more escapism than anything . also cheesy at times and pseudo hose scenes fall flat . they should have left the original Death Wish'' on its own without sequels since they did n't should have stopped here .
2947_10.txt,1, Fantastic documentary . movie within a movie . I'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother's death . Makes one wonder about the time and money spent in therapy . What might have happened if she did n't have that outlet ? Did the therapist help her or just foster a dependency that kept his bank account flush ? The audience needs to understand that divorce was less of an option in those days . She was a housewife went to therapy instead of going to college or job training . She seemed to feel trapped by the situation . wonder if the therapist ever tried to get her to think about what she could have done to change her situation and free herself ? Meanwhile wife was just the opposite . She was out there working with his Dad ended her bad marriage supported herself and appears to be a very confident giving person . Whatever the state of the marriage the Blocks did something right in raising kids who could look at their parents story be OK with it and share it with us and maybe lead us to start conversations with our parents and spouses .
1369_7.txt,1, My buddies and spent the majority of a Saturday afternoon watching a selection of bad'' movies . Among the flicks we watched the strongest contender quality bad fare was easily Jack It's ludicrous that movies such as Gigli'' Glitter'' and You Got Served'' are listed in IMDBs bottom While they're certainly bad movies they do n't belong in the bottom They're robbing Jack and Keeper of Time'' etc of the Bad Movie Greatness they so richly deserve . So what makes Jack so great bad movie terms For starters Steve Latshaw the director decided to cast his son Ryan Latshaw in the role of Sean Kelly . Unfortunately for Steve Ryan Latshaw was dangerously close to being out by a block of wood . The kid seriously has no ability to emote whatsoever . The end result unintentional comic gold . The kid could be listening to a joke or just moments away from getting his head smashed asunder and his expression is one of stony emotionlessness'' The other aspect of the movie that we found awesome was the sheer number of double dreaming'' sequences . What is a double Well it's when a character wakes up from a nightmare and then something equally nightmarish happens and then the character wakes up again . Basically they wake up after dreaming about waking up from a nightmare . Clever device no ? believe the character of Sean Kelly experienced no less than double sequences . Let's see . what else ? Oh yeah ! This movie has a veritable cast of thousands . It's truly stunning to see how many speaking roles are introduced throughout the course of the movie . Best of all almost none of the characters have anything to do with the story . They're either killed by Jack or they serve no purpose whatsoever . Jack himself was pretty sweet . Like most other monsters Jack has the amazing ability to seemingly teleport over great distances . He's invariably hanging somewhere in the background whenever you're dealing with a major character . What's puzzling however is that when he's actually chasing someone he moves at a shambling speed and yet he's able to keep up with people who are sprinting . That's all for now . Closing remarks if you're looking for a unintentionally hilarious bad movie you ca n't go wrong by renting this beast . Bad Movie Score Good Movie Score
2819_7.txt,1, Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers a few small ones Saw this on Satilite channel missed the first min of movie will keep this comment short and informative . The movie is basically about characters acting is very bad for afew characters . girl with the help of another girl kidnaps different people but it backfires and the kidnap the This is one of those types of movies where the script writers try to be thought provoking or philosophical mysterious and you get the point but do to their own personal lack in thinking they fall terribly short . Like one of the captives who is supposed to be some type of psychology nerd looks the part but his tongue ca n't speak it . THe writers think that if the nerd uses a lot of letter words amateurishly unknowingly believe that the viewers will be ignorant enough to believe it . wish could give an example but cant recall any exactly as it was said . The ending was bad as well . But the one female captive acted her role as an old and relatively wise lady although she as well as the rest had a lot of clich So Why would give this movie a stars if thought all the above ? Simple give the entire seven stars to LISA KELLER one sexy momma . SHE is FINE lol . am an appreciator of beauty and she is exactly that . But do n't get me confused because I'm not a pervert and this movie is NOT a porno in any way . their is somethin about her cant explain but like it . remember the scene where a captive has broke free and as he looks for a way out bumps into Keller . She tries to get way but she does n't have a chance . He throws her down kneeling on the stairs and he pulls her pants down no panties Now although she has an AMAZING ass and the this shot leaves little to the imagination for a long seconds think it was her facial expression that got me . she wanted it and that look had me thinking was behind that . would have torn that booty up ! After that expression jus could n't look at her objectively anymore WAS IN LOVE . lol . am glad to have seen this movie but if Lisa Keller was n't playing the lead role would have changed the channel . well . after had seen the scene mentioned above . am a LISA KELLER fan know but is seems that she is n't a consistent actor seeing this movie is her latest . But am lookin forward to another movie with her in it .
6128_10.txt,1, My rating of course applies only if you're willing to get completely and utterly grossed out Because you know that only John Waters can do that . In Pink Flamingos'' directorial debut he portrays two families locked in combat to see who can be the filthiest person alive . What Divine famously does at the end pretty much answers the question . But even aside from that the movie is basically an excuse to shock people beyond what anyone would usually imagine . You had better have a very strong stomach to watch this movie . Even some of the lines are rather mind avoid this movie like you would the ebola virus !
4222_7.txt,1, I'm warning you this movie is not scary . If you're a horror movie fan especially a Child's Play fan you'll think it's incredibly funny but you wo n't be scared . It's not a bad movie but it's not scary .
11874_8.txt,1, One Night at McCool's is a very funny movie that is more intelligent than what it should be . Its form is more sophisticated than what expected and its randomness was superb . The thoughts behind the movie sadism stupid men are are infantile . That's what have to say about this movie is that not only does it hate women but it loathes men . It does n't have any sympathy for any of the men really . It seems that way because of the form but the ending says it all . Nobody cares . The form has the first of the movie told in flashback by three characters Dillon the stupid bartender Reiser the mysogenistic stupid lawyer and Goodman the stupid holier cop . The story is therefore always perverted by their own self images and altered realities . Reiser's BBQ fantasy is a great touch . In the end we never really know the truth and nothing is what it seems . Dillon was never that innocent etc . Actually the rest of the movie is funny too . From the randomness of the last seconds of the movie to the overly of Tyler's manipulations the movie seems to have an energy all its own . Everything is just out of the blue and nothing seems to make sense . Do we really care if it does ? No . It is also a very dark comedy but has a shallow presentation . Think Nurse Betty or Jawbreaker . Very candy coated outside dark chewy inside . If you like your movies random dark or just purely mean see this movie . This one will satisfy your urges for the strangeness that is One Night at McCool's .
5744_10.txt,1, Right here we go you have probably read in previous reviews on this film that it is awful badly acted avoid at all costs . Well suppose in some ways this is true it is fair to say that you could n't write a spoiler in this comment as there is no plot to spoil . However there is a fine line between plain awful and absolutely hilarious and believe me this film is the latter . The acting is so bad the plot so non existent and the ending so completely baffling it will have you laughing the whole way through . There are scenes in this film that take comedy to a new level . Do not expect an Oscar winner but believe me for the small price you will pay for this disaster it is worth every penny .
6122_8.txt,1, For me Pink Flamingos lived up to it's reputation as being the shocking disgusting repulsive trashy film was expecting it to be that really contains everything but the kitchen sink . We are treated to almost two hours of nastiness that never lets up rape sex sex with chickens transsexuals castration murder cannibalism and a horrid display of singing out ones anus . It is about a strange couple who begin a competition with a trailer trash family trying to steal their title as the filthiest people alive'' Divine fat guy in drag is an unbelievably vile human being who actually becomes painful to watch . Trust me when say that this film is not one to be quickly forgotten especially the end scene in which Divine eats dog crap off the sidewalk . have always thought John Waters was over and can not say like this film but it is an experience if you ever get a chance to see it .
1397_10.txt,1, Fans of Euro flicks Portland's video store Movie Madness has a whole section devoted to this genre ca n't afford to miss Sergio Martino's gut L'isola degli uomini pesce'' Screamers'' in the United States Here's the lowdown some shipwreck survivors land on an uncharted Caribbean island in The island is inhabited by a landowner a scientist Cotten and his daughter Bach Sure enough it turns out that the landowner is making the scientist create a race of fish And while the fish remain calm as long as they can drink their potion they get nasty otherwise . This movie is sort of a mixture of genres Euro swashbuckling voodoo and maybe a little bit of The Island of Dr. Moreau'' But it's mostly an excuse to have the fish disembowel trespassers ya got ta love that ! would n't be surprised if the Euro genre gave Quentin Tarantino some of his ideas for Grindhouse'' After all the European horror directors have no scruples about what they show . This is one that you're sure to like . So Joseph Cotten is the only cast member from an Alfred Hitchcock movie mean Shadow of a Doubt'' who later co with Ringo Starr's soon wife and Audrey Hepburn's ex whom mean Mel Ferrer in an Italian horror flick . The things that we see in life .
1620_7.txt,1, As is the case with many films of this ilk my non Catholicism got in the way of my understanding it . The church has this mass of rules which have been put together over centuries . We have a short time to learn them and have to accept them at face value . Then throw in some bad guys getting revenge for a long distant act against them working under these rules and attempting to circumvent them and you have this book and movie . found myself thinking That's pretty cool . Why did they do that ? There's this casual thing in the Robert Langdon character where no matter what the issue he seems to always make the right first move . suppose it's like watching CSI where they solve incredibly complex cases in a matter of days . They know the lay of the land . In this film there is so much land and so little time to really understand everything that is going on . But if you create Robert Langdon you need to set him to work . That's OK because heroic nerds like him have been saving the day forever . thought the film was fun . thought the Da Vinci Code was fun too . Interesting and not as bad as people seemed to think . This is a marvel to look at and never stops for a second .
8512_10.txt,1, People criticize NSNA because it is a low in Bond god Sean Connery's career and because it is unofficial . CONTAIN SPOILERS First of all this movie is better then any other bond film featuring any other actor then Connery all sub par wannabes in my book . Sean Connery is the only real Bond no one comes even close to his toughness good looks and sex appeal . Yes this movie is a low point in Connery's Bond career but it is still the definet best bond film of the Sean Connery is the only Bond actor who is good at an older age . he did not become a baggy mess like Moore but kept his good looks and toughness but gaining some gray hair . So what ? hes still the only real and he is as cool and tough as ever . Sean Connery is the one and only And this movie is definitly worth seeing no matter what anyone says . No gun opening but you ca n't have everything can you ? great theme song though .
288_7.txt,1, One thing that came across to me in watching this film is that it was fun for the cast and crew could sense that they were going up against the budget constraint with enthusiasm dedication because they apparently liked the people involved . tend to like movies that are original and have heart and think this is one such work . The actors seem to me to be putting there hearts in it more than usual maybe because of some good direction from the lead actress and they evidently were clear enough in their parts of the story to make a coherent watchable piece of art . The critiques of this film that more or less say why not just rent a hardcore porn movie make the point as to why they did n't like the film . Going to this film hoping for a lot of without patience for the material of the plot is why it is so unenjoyable for them . One could say the movie is more of a romantic work than a softcore porn movie even though take it the star has done her share of soft porn . think she graduated . In terms of the writing the dialog is not a huge part of the movie like in a Tarentino film but the plot is decent and the twists are original and sometimes fun . Particularly the ending is not a disappointment but a pleasure with the villianess and the leading man'' learning from their complex web of feelings . understand that the producer got a film deal out of this . Hats off for proving a few tens of thousands of dollars can go pretty far if you have some artistic sensibility and pride . Gabriella and the other girls with scenes of nudity were likable along with being hot not just airhead bimbos so as an erotic science fantasy piece with some gorgeous nude art even with the limits of land not disappointing .
3275_8.txt,1, Ok maybe Posse ca n't compare to other popular cowboy movies . But that's because it did n't have the FUNDING those movies had . Obviously whenever you want to produce a story such as this one focusing on African American historical involvement NO servants and are not historical involvement Hollywood is n't going to be too supportive . And believe me they were n't . The producers and actors sacrificed a lot of of pocket expenses to make Posse'' just so that the story could be told . think that alone is commendable . Posse may not be Oscar material they do n't like Black media too much either but it is a start . It is entertaining and it introduces us to the black cowboy a character most of us are unfamiliar with .
9161_7.txt,1, Well the movie is basically about the last days of a specific Russian regiment stationed in Afghansitan before the main troop withdrawal in The movie accurately portrays the grim realities of Russian army that have made it infamous dedovshina'' and NCOs physically harassing beating and humiliating younger recruits mixed character of war can trade with your enemy one day and kill him the next life of women at the front lines documentary footages of helicopter assaults and coffins being soldered and sent home in heave Hercules class Russian cargo planes with tracer to jam Stinger missiles fatigue boredom anti sentiment emotional side simply put . The there's some action scenes but they are poorly done and often are illogical like Major Bandura's suicidal walk and turning of his back to kid armed with AK who's father he just killed . Also the fact that in the middle of firefight in the mountains heavy grenade launcher pops out of nowhere any half person knows that it's virtually impossible to hump lns launcher on the march anyone But at the same time films shows that war is a dirty affair where murder is sometimes condoned wanton destruction of whole villages for little or no reason is normal indiscriminate killing of civilians is overlooked as collateral damage inevitable during war . Some food for thought as to why Afghan war as lost . Not the best war movie made but profound and intelligent enough to be worth watching .
744_10.txt,1, Look In the Basement is so easy to knock but the truth is simply that Brownrigg is one of Horrors real underground stars and IMHO is vastly overdue some proper recognition . is his undisputed masterpiece . This scummy psychodrama snags the viewer straightaway into such an odd disjointed claustrophobic world of sweating insanity you have no real idea what the hell is going on . It succeeds in making you feel strangely dirty just plain grubby for Brownrigg's world is this mad unwashed scummy prison cell of rants obsessions and all shades of mental illness . And he uses his low budget palette to wrap his grot blanket around you like a bad memory . There is just something so beautifully odd about the whole damn thing . In a word classic . Also if you watch first then you will have some idea of the insane psychodrama style that marks Brownrigg's other films . In summary they really do n't come any more esoteric than this well actually they do track down Brownrigg's My Grave Open Mad genius . Accept no substitute .

It's up to fearless rugged cop Jonathan Graves Peter Liapis to stop her . Meanwhile two pitifully unfunny comic relief'' dwarf gnome creatures run amok in Los Angeles . Seasoned veteran schlock exploitation expert Jim Wynorski relates the supremely inane story at a brisk pace and takes none of this foolishness remotely seriously .

Mark Stevi's puerile cookie cutter script an amusingly lowbrow sense of no humor Chuck Cirino's bouncy cornball score the two dwarf guys sporting obvious cheap rubber Halloween masks Bash's plain cinematography no tension or gratuitous female nudity to speak of and the tacky than special effects all further enhance the overall delicious cheesiness of this prime slice of celluloid Velveeta .

119_9.txt,1, finally watched the third film in Mehta's trilogy Fire'' To begin I'd say that Water'' was the unquestionable masterpiece on all levels . Fire comes next with Earth close behind in order of quality . Fire there is so much going on in this film that I'll need a few more viewings to drink it all in . The writing is superb the script creating friction that starts the entire process of heat'' from the beginning until the end when it really does erupt into a fire the conflicts moving into complete rupture of relationships . Mehta is one brave lady she sees with a clear eye much that is jaundiced false and repressive about the great society from which she came from . India is rapidly changing these days but much of this is economic change . That she met with such ferocious opposition to the making of Water'' after having had the script cleared shows that there are still many taboo subjects which Indian people more than less can not look squarely in the face can not examine or discuss them . Worse if someone like Mehta has the courage to hold up a mirror to these issues she faces death threats . So as much as India thinks of itself as a pluralistic tolerant society the facts are not always so . Whereas Earth'' was merely a historical setting of the carnage of the civil war after Indian independence Fire and Water are pointing at personal social and religious issues which as say are considered so strongly a negative sense that an open artistic dialog is still many years away . As write this Water'' is scheduled to actually be shown in India later this year . I'll believe it when see it . Fire confronts a similar sexual and emotional conundrum that saw in price above rubies'' Whether it's arranged marriages it used to be like among Jews about years ago or like it is among many modern Indians they have the risk of having a bad match forced upon both men and women or just plain loveless marriages . However this is not the real issue . Mehta is clearly impatient with the totally rigid religious attitudes that either keep widows in misery or else keep women enslaved to loveless marriages am no expert regarding either the secular or Hindu laws concerning divorce . The film seems to imply that the stigma divorce almost as bad as the sad marriage . In any case Mehta's film is a very moving powerful attempt at sexual discourse that holds modern Indian relationships up to probing scrutiny . That all three of these films have made themselves felt in India as an unwarranted attack on their culture sounds to me like the predictable clamor of a repressive mindset . Mehta is forcing the issues to be looked at no matter how much flack . admire her work and can not highly recommend her films enough . Superb disturbing provocative taboo shattering .
8711_10.txt,1, Words fail me whenever want to describe my feelings about this movie the sequels Does it have flaws ? Sure it does . Starting with the Subspecies'' themselves were not executed well enough for a special effect . why do glorify these movies ? For the herd of movie mass out there care more about quantity than quality cheap fun more than about depth crap like blade'' does n't even deserve a capital letter and so on are good movies to munch popcorn to and drink a couple of cokes . What makes Subspecies a superior effort for anyone claiming to be a Vampire fanatic the other hand obvious The Vampire Himself is Romanian story is set in Transylvania scenes filmed on location are more than convincing the atmosphere is not based on any action chases or expensive orchestral music . Himself is the source of the atmosphere . This is what a Vampire should look like and this is how He should behave ! Add a breathtakingly gloomy castle with dark passageways situated in Romania some typical Vampiric elements such as the movement of the shadows on the walls when the Vampires take to flight and you have a work of art ! In short me fascinated with Vampires and feel that their appearance as well as the setting should be sinister and dark no better place to look in than in a Subspecies movie . Or in Vampire Journals brilliant spin off of the former .
7835_7.txt,1, Let's get one thing straight this gets an out of not on a normal scale but out of the bad movie scale . this is the kind of movie you rent on purpose where you intentionally walk in knowing that it is a horrendous knockoff and shun'd by everyone else . went in with one promise from the movie that there will be snakes on a train and it Delivers ! The gore itself is really good and the characters have awesome roles . Come on it has everything from stoned train pilots to teenage girls trafficking drugs even a Electrical Engineer getting his pimp on ! You get to see some topless nudity explosions snakes gore and a Mexican main lead running around curing his girlfriend by hitting his crack pipe and blowing the smoke in her face ! As mentioned and many others have the movie pacing is a bit off but respectable nonetheless . Movies like this keep our group tradition of banding together and all chipping in a buck or two to watch masterpieces such as this . There can be no better time spent then coming together to enjoy a good bad movie . It could learn a thing or two from the likes of other such fine flicks as Alien Lock or Boa vs Python but those are some big shoes to fill . solid out of
11988_10.txt,1, The only conceivable flaw of this film is it's title ! Please stop comparing it to the first ! did in my previous review only to separate it from the first . If you have n't seen the movie and are curious TOTALLY forget about the first and invent a different name for this . There is nothing alike and has a mood all its own . This is a great exponent of screwy mid comedy . seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first . Anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus . maintain the only reason this is in the IMDB bottom is because of its title . usually hate movies like these adam sandler will farrell farrelly bros. but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically . dunno maybe it's like a bad relationship ca n't get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure . Either way this is the single most underrated movie of the behind Stunt Man . Robert Stack WE LOVE YOU !
1472_10.txt,1, Ok when rented this several years ago had the worst expectations . Yes the acting is n't great and the picture itself looks dated but as sat there a strange thing happened . started to like it . The action is great and there are few scenes that make you jump . Brion James maybe one of the greatest actors next to Bruce Campbell is great as always . The story is n't bad either . Now would n't rush out and buy it but you wo n't waste your time at least watching this good post apocalyptic western .
1510_8.txt,1, Un Gatto nel Cervello or Nightmare Concert as it's more commonly know amongst English speaking audiences starts as horror film director Lucio Fulci by the man himself Lucio Fulci goes to lunch after filming a very gory violent scene however he orders steak has a horrible vision relating to cannibalism . The grotesque visions hallucinations dreams continue begin to affect his mental state Fulci decides to seek help contacts Professor Egon Schwarz Thompson for psychiatric help . Schwarz claims that Fulci can not separate fantasy from reality agrees to help him however Schwarz has a more sinister ulterior motive as a serial killer starts to brutally kill prostitutes Fulci thinks he might be responsible . This Italian production was co directed by Lucio Fulci who also stars in the film as a horror film director named Lucio Fulci which does n't really feel like a lot of effort went into it anyway Un Gatto nel Cervello is gory if nothing else for that alone rather liked it . The script by Fulci John Fitzsimmons Giovanni Simonelli Antonio Tentori is nothing more than a threadbare excuse to edit together lots of gory footage from other Italian films . It serves it's purpose well enough suppose to see Fulci on screen has a certain fascination if your a fan of his or are familiar with his films the ending is very rushed almost as if they ran out of money as it just has a policeman telling Fulci they killed the killer that's it . Another thing about that ending when the two cops put the white sheet over the dead killer in the field then they walk away leaving it there without any other police presence mean would the police in Italy just leave a dead body in the middle of a field on it's own ? It moves along at a good pace if you like your gore then you have to see this although if you do n't like gore then you'll hate it with a passion it all depends on your disposition so the choice folks is yours . Director Fulci was never the most artistically adept filmmaker it shows here as his footage is bland flat looks like it was shot for TV the footage from the other films in total does n't match the stuff Fulci shot it is obvious that this has been pieced together from different films . If your looking for gore you've hit the jackpot people are dismembered with chainsaws put through meat grinders faces are melted there are a few decapitations there are some slit throats someones body is gorily crushed under a car a tongue is ripped out someone has their throat crushed as a wheelchair runs over it there are loads of stabbings someone has their guts removed with a hook there's a rotten corpse complete with maggots someone hand is cut off someone has their head bashed in their eye falls out a gory death by piano wire as it slices through someones throat there are loads of severed limbs gallons of blood splashed around a scene of some cats eating brains there's more as well . Having said that some of the special effects are a bit fake look cheesy . With a supposed budget of around it shows this is pretty cheap looking it has no visual style or artistic merit but then again why would you want those when you can see a Nazi orgy sequence wall gore ? The acting in this is terrible including Fulci . Un Gatto nel Cervello is a top film if your a gore like me however if your looking for something with a little bit more substance or indeed any substance then this ones not for you . This is the sort of film which divides people straight down the middle you'll either love what it does or hate it .
10541_8.txt,1, know what you're saying Oh man Pinochio is not scary ! but this movie goes beyond alot more than a maniacal pinochio . Behind it tells the story of a mother and her daughter who is oddly attached to her doll Pinnochio who seems to talk to her . The only weird thing is that noone else can hear the doll except her . In the end is shocking revelation that as did will shock you . Watch it . Give it a try .
9673_7.txt,1, own all family guy seasons so far and have to say Vol . has been the biggest disappoint of them all . There are still plenty of laughs to be found here but think Vol . like the last few volumes is slowly providing less and less laughs . At least for me . The biggest annoyance had with Vol . is it seems to be VERY heavy in left wing politics . I'm a big believer in if you can laugh at other people you should be able to laugh at yourself but this Volume REALLY seems to shove their political view points down your throat and think it takes a lot away from the show . Insinuated all conservative sates are horrible places Insinuating we need more gun control Insinuated school are under funded Insinuated religious people are crazy Bush is friends with the devil . could go on and this is just from the first three episodes . Sure some of it was funny but there becomes a point when you're not making a comedy and you're really just shoving your political views on other people .
666_7.txt,1, This BRASS EYE special PAEDO was swamped by complaints More on that later when it was broadcast in following a national debate around a possible Sarah law following the abduction and murder of school girl Sarah Payne In fact it scheduling was delayed while Phil Collins took legal advice after he found out he been fooled by the show maker Chris Morris into a starting a campaign entitled Nonce If truth be told this show is probably more remembered for the controversy than the content which is in very poor taste but do confess that laughed out loud The edition centres around paedophiles and how society treats both them and their victims Chris Morris plays the presenter who tells the audience that an infamous paedophile has been launched into space then confesses that an eight year old child has accidentally been placed into the capsule along with the paedophile Cue the child frightened screams Like said very poor taste Other highlights of the show include Dr Fox giving a scientific lecture that paedophiles share an identical nervous system to crabs No one knows this but it a scientific fact Labour MP Barbara Follet giving a public warning about equipment paedophiles put on their genitals while surfing the net and Kate Thornton warning viewers that paedophiles can send gas through the internet which makes young children suseptable to sexual predators including one victim Who was once a shy innocent child and who now has the sexuality of a sixty year old Colonel Morris also shows a police officer in the child protection squad a serious of photos wanting to know if they classed as obscene The photos included Barbie surrounded by a marital aids and a composite photo featuring a young boys head a dog body and an erect penis that could only have belonged to John Holmes Hey never said this show was tasteful did It impossible to mention PAEDO without the hypocritical fall out that surrounded it where politicians childrens organizations and policemen rushed to condemn the show for making fun of a very serious subject The show was poor taste despite me laughing all the way through it but it a biting satire Perhaps the critics should take a long hard look in the mirror where a liberal elite allows convicted paedophile slime to walk around the streets of Britain before they criticise a mere TV show for exacerbating tensions
7113_7.txt,1, This is quite an entertaining in the Universal Horror series featuring Dracula the Wolfman and Frankenstein's Monster . The plot revolves around Dracula Carradine and Larry Talbot the wolfman Chaney Jr. separately visiting a revolutionary doctor . They both ask him if they can be cured and the doctor attempts to devise a way for each . Beneath the doctor's castle they find Frankenstein's Monster buried in mud is apparently a reference to the previous movie in the Frankenstein series Of course if things had went as planned the movie would have turned out incredibly boring . Instead Dracula ca n't suppress his appetite and the doctor is eventually infected by a blood transfusion with vampirism . As a semi the doctor goes insane and awakens Frankenstein's Monster . As with all of the Universal Horror series the ending is completely unsatisfactory . beautiful woman with a hunchback one of the doctor's two assistants has a particularly gruesome end . Plus you just have to feel sorry for Frankenstein's Monster in this film he's awake for around two minutes kills one police officer and then yet another building this the fifth now ? collapses on top of him and is consumed by flames . It is also unfortunate that the great character created in The Wolf Man Larry Talbot is really reduced here . People underrate that film and Chaney's performance in it . Here he would be justifiably criticized as wooden . All in all though it's a pretty fun movie at just minutes . nice waste of time .
1403_7.txt,1, just watched this an early Harold Lloyd short film that featured his glasses'' character on Kino Video's DVD of The Harold Lloyd Collection'' He's actually a con man with Snub Pollard as his partner who gets discovered by Bebe Daniels who herself performs fake What she discovers is that Lloyd and Pollard bilk many customers by dropping fake rings that are lost'' I'll stop there and just say this was quite funny especially when Harold and Snub enter the place Bebe works and encounter some creepy contraptions and put on costumes like Snub trying one of Bebe's outfits . Not too much slapstick but what there is of was also quite funny . So on that note recommend Are Crooks Dishonest ?
8309_8.txt,1, CONTEXT is everything when one goes to rate a movie . When rating this movie one has to consider the time in which it was made . We did n't really know WHAT the inside of the EARTH was in those days so you ca n't rag on the movie too much for the plot on a much older book For the era this was top notch special effects and the production quality was great . watched this movie in a masterfully restored HD master . For the time the makeup and effects almost make the guys in the rubber suits look plausible as a monster This is pure movie cheese complete with bad rubber suits models and creepy costumes . AWESOME . PS Doug McClure ROCKS !
6709_9.txt,1, lot of people say the end did not make sense but it did . With the female vampire dead the link to earth was broken and the ship took off having picked up a lot of Lifeforce from hundreds of thousands of souls . Enough to re those hexagon cells and create new bat creatures . It seems they do not have carnal sex like vampires of legend . vampire bats from outer space may be ludicrous but killing them with with a shot to qui force center below the heart is consistent . All you can ask for is consistency . The viewer has to suspend disbelief even for scifi . The only problem is having to be a sword or stake not bullets . That puts in a supernatural twist that does not fit with sci So that is a problem . The only major inconsistency found is killing the male vampires with the sword but the soul of the girl and Carlsen go up to the ship . assume the males souls also went up the ship but not shown . What about all the humans killed ? Do their qui forces go up to the ship as discrete entities are does all the lifeforce get merged into one for use as ship sees fit ? In other words all the human souls that went to the ship could be re as bat creatures . The basic concept is no more ridiculous than Star Wars Force'' or even re This movie was over the top kitchen sink of the Dead meets Alien meets Dracula but in many ways profound . It was also a beautiful love story . The beginning and end were ethereal . It both began is happening to me'' and ended as a love story . Most of the criticism of the movie is about its being bizarre . what ? Bizarre is an art form . As far as being ludicrous it all fits . The plague concept is much more interesting and subtle than the Aliens just killing people . Maybe they did n't need Patrick Steward's blood to form an image of the girl but it was a very far out surreal scene . Another reason the movie is hated is because of the end . But the end fits perfectly with the beginning . People are so wrapped up in the nude girl that they miss the movie's core . Its a lover story start to finish . It starts with Carlsen and the girl on the alien spaceship and finished same way . So it fits perfectly . Most people are fixated on the hero killing the monster and this movie did not end that way which is precisely why love it . Instead it has a happy ending with the of them going back to ship to be reborn . Way cooler than the hero kills monster end but that is exactly why it bombed . It was not a straight horror or even scifi at all but a love story with a beautiful beginning and end . All those souls twinkling on the ship . And the crystal room pulsating with new life . Most people ca n't deal with a love story that is also Alien meets Dawn of the Dead meets Dracula .
11417_7.txt,1, liked this movie . I'm not a big horror movie buff so could n't comment on similarities between this and other movies of this genre but found this movie quite captivating . the story line albeit a little obvious had some genuinely scary moments and the acting of the lead female role was n't bad in anyway Overall i'm a little surprised at the low rating this movie has gotten . watch a lot of movies in a video store tends to help and this really is n't as bad as people seem to think . do have some criticism though . The final call from the cop was terrible almost overacted the dead girl in the bathroom looked liked she was having a little sleep from the amount of tequila she mentioned she drank and the children's reaction to what was happening instilled in me the hope that they were ultimately killed hope this helps some people
3637_10.txt,1, The subject of this movie is disturbing . How could some otherwise intelligent religious hard and sincere White Afrikaaners treat the native Blacks so cruelly for so long ? The movie answers this question and also explains how some Afrikaaners are changing in a positive way .
5463_10.txt,1, as a former TV editor can say this is as authentic as it gets . It even led to Letterman's producer to be a source resigning in real life . Letterman was outraged so one goofy thing is it has him throwing softballs at a tire swing on his estate total fabrication but the main information is hilariously true from the silly bidding war for Letterman once he decided to leave NBC to Leno's problems with an agent who was not ready for big time but who he let run the show to a disastrous exit out of his famed loyalty . If any of you kids do n't grasp the idea of why Letterman is jealous to this day see this tape .
11699_8.txt,1, Considering the appalling track record of Mick Molloy since going out on his own had rather low expectations of Crackerjack . Even the promotional posters for the movie had me nervous . In fact if it was n't for the fact that I'd received free tickets to the preview would have resisted the pressure from the missus thinks Mick's a hunk there's a worry to pay money for it . The first few minutes of the movie had me worried it starts with one of Micks tired get angry at insignificant things'' routines but that was given a neat touch which at least made it a little refreshing . The rest of the script was pretty good and very light hearted even the typical Mick Molloy Judith Lucy humour was delivered well and whilst never had to pick myself up from the aisles it generated a lot more chuckles that was expecting it was consistant There's nothing new in the plot pretty predictable but it moved along quickly between one and other jokes never felt it harboured on any element too long or too short Mick must have worked hard on polishing his script . There were a one or two Late Show'' in and one or two jokes that only Melbournians would get but certainly there's plenty of generic stuff in there for a wider audience . Something that found disappointing was the relative unfunnyness of John Clarke he just did n't seem to work as the bad guy but that does n't detract from the movie too much . Over all enjoyed this Australain comedy and was pleasantly entertained for the duration of the movie . left the cinema with a decent sized grin a pretty hard thing for an Australian comedy to do in my books .
6867_8.txt,1, was very curious about Anatomy Anatomie and if was going to see it was going to have to buy it since no video stores in my area carried the film . Since it was not a low DVD did take a chance and thought I'd take a peek at other comments on IMDb . Many of the comments did n't give me enough hope of forking out lots of bucks for a film had never seen nor had any clues about . basically got the idea it was a sexy youth romp being compared to many cookie teen thrillers . Well something in the back of my mind told me to ignore those types of comments and buy it ! did and was pleasantly surprised ! If it is going to be compared to any other films would say it's a variation of Coma and Extreme Measures . could n't see any comparison to films like Scream Urban Legends et al . Yes the cast is young because they're med students ! At least they are n't the increasingly boring high school type characters and yes some are lusty the character played by Anna Loos is and it is handled quite tastefully in the German language version but Anatomy is well constructed there is a tense mood throughout the sets are amazing the makeup effects are a wow and Franka Potente is very credible in her role . found myself enjoying all of it despite a few gaping holes in the plot ! The story of a student discovering a sort secret society doing autopsies on still patients is a rather creepy scenario and what happens to those patients afterwards is quite clever . Sure you could ask why did n't she just GET OUT OF THAT TOWN ? Okay but then the film would be over within a half hour . This was the first effort from the German part of Columbia Pictures and it's actually quite an impressive one . There was a bit of care in the production and to actually offer some genuine thrills is an accomplishment . It is a bit mature in mind as it does n't resort to constant opportunities for sexual encounters breast fest or juvenile drug jokes . Anna Loos character while often making sexual remarks and looking for some fun was actually a nice touch a character that was a woman more intelligent than any of the men in the school . She found that sex was really just a distraction for her and the men rather lacking . THE IMPORTANT STUFF Watching this film in the original German language with English or French subtitles is the BEST way to enjoy it . saw the theatrical trailers dubbed in English and was disgusted by the change it made in the film's tone . have never seen a properly dubbed film in my life never can find voices that suit the film's actors or characters . Sure enough tried to watch some of Anatomy dubbed in English and the intelligence level of it dropped severely making it seem more like a comedy . good example is when one guy was freaked out at being cut open and screamed to be sewn back up it in German he sounded frantic but dubbed in English he sounded like a comedian . Frankly I'm sick of hearing people say they ca n't handle reading subtitles or watch a letterboxed'' film . Anatomy comes off as silly with dubbed voices that seem octaves too high for any of the people you see in the film and Anna Loos sexual comments then just sound like awful remarks right out of Fast Times At Ridgemont High . wonder if the negative comments about Anatomy are from people who watched it dubbed it just does n't seem like the same film at all ! This is not a cheap horror film and deserves to be viewed as it was created . Interesting to note that some of the English subtitles are different in scenes in the feature and the making of'' supplement . As it turns out gambled and won with Anatomy . It's a competent thriller with likeable characters and does n't try to go for cheap thrills .
9395_8.txt,1, OK it's easy not to confuse this with the lame Stuart Gordon movie called Death Bed'' that came out a few years back because this one is The Bed That Eats'' And how do even begin to describe this ? Well for starters obviously there is a bed that eats . This is as a result of demon teardrops which of course affect most things guess in a negative way . The bed is in some old servant's quarters or something and has been responsible for the disappearances of quite a few people in its time . We have a narrator who is a ghost that sits in the wall behind a painting and collects all the non goodies etc that the bed passes on . He died of consumption one of the few people to lay in the bed that did n't get eaten probably because he was sick he theorizes as we see him hacking blood into hankies . The thing about this movie is that is has a very odd sense of humor to it but it's all played pretty deadpan . The movie is divided into several acts'' guess Breakfast Lunch Dinner Just Desserts'' For fans of the unfathomably weird and bizarre well this may just be right up your alley . All can say is you have to see this one to believe it it pretty well defies description . out of stars .
6236_7.txt,1, This is a bizarre oddity directed by the guy who edited The Texas Chainsaw Massacre . Chuck Conners gives a hilariously over performance as the owner of a roadside wax'' museum which our doomed teenagers happen to break down near . The wax figures look so real one of the teen's points out . Heh heh heh . so much a slasher film as a weird mix of psychological horror and old fashioned House of Wax'' terror . can think of many many horror films that are worse than this one .
4903_7.txt,1, Although a woman's story found this still fairly interesting . It is unusual in that is has three real sisters playing sisters in the movie ! am referring to Priscilla Rosemary and Lola Lane . Why national critics loved this movie was the presence of bad John Garfield . In their twisted Liberal minds All characters are sickening but sour life poor types like Garfield played here are people they can identify with . Despite that this movie still has an overall feeling of goodness which is why liked it . Some of the characters may have done stupid things but they good hearts . Whose heart was bigger than Ann's'' Lane in here ? agree with the IMDb user comments critic in here who says this is Priscilla's film as much as the beloved by me Garfield's . With a director the caliber of Michael Curtiz the film is better than it might have been under someone else . Curtiz made sure no scene soapy or otherwise went on too long . In addition to the Lane sisters and Garfield we have Claude Rains adds much humor to the story Jeffrey Lynn main love interest of the girls Gale Page Dick Foran Frank McHugh and Mae Robson . Apparently this movie must have been a hit because there were several spin from it neither of them approaching this one in content and box success .
4591_7.txt,1, There is a lot wrong with this film . will not lie . will say that most of the problems feel like they stem from a budget that was chopped out from underneath the flick and some bad hack job editing . This is not Office Space . Do not go in expecting Office Space levels of comedy . It is very funny though . It is a mess but very funny at the same time . funny mess of a film . In the way that Caddyshack is funny . mess of unrelated funny scenes filled with some very annoying unfunny scenes . It works as a whole though and it certainly deserves a wide release . This is the best commentary on the Wal Mart Starbucks MTV nation you could hope for . The very fact that a film is exploring the idea that dumb people are breeding at an alarming rate while the intelligent people are not is great in my book . Not very politically correct but worth at least some debate .

2516_10.txt,1, Cool action yeah the premise has been done but not this way that's the trick . hey folks SHOCK it's an To me it's cool that Scully have almost no scenes together they have to adapt rely on each other's intrinsic sense about what's really going on and each other's adaptation skills . They read into each other's moves and get the job done . of Oh yeah really good acting do these people get paid to do this ? Or a slow day when the convenience store does n't call them into work . Duchovny where's the day donuts ? Malcolm get to school .
9310_8.txt,1, Okay maybe it was because happen to be in Yangchun China when saw this movie . Maybe it was because finally had something on TV could understand or at least read the subtitles or maybe it was just funny . Whatever it was this movie was worth the time . had just arrived for my foot and head massage when they gave me the remote so could watch TV . Usually would turn the darn thing off but stumbled upon this crazy movie and got hooked . The plot if you could call it a plot sort of revolves around a cooking competition and sort of is a love story and the food in this movie is the real star . If you like Iron Chef and many of the other cooking shows currently in the reality TV mode then you will love the scenes with food in this movie . It goes fast and the subtitles are so fast you better be up on speed reading for this one . However the action is mostly slapstick so you do n't always have to read the entire subtitle to get the idea . The main actress is lovely eye candy and the main actor is n't bad to look at either . They are both worth watching . Finally if you have some time to kill and want a good laugh this is n't a bad choice for both . do n't speak a word of Chinese but was totally able to understand the cultural humor of this film . For those who do speak Chinese maybe it is even better . Overall give this an out of and currently am even looking to find a copy to have while stay in China and keep for when come back home it will be a nice reminder for me of my time in Yangchun and a silly afternoon at the massage salon watching a silly movie .
5220_10.txt,1, Father Hood can understand why a lot of people hate this tale of a father kidnapping his two children and carrying them across America but I've seen much worse and saw this years ago did n't think it was particularly awful . Patrick Swayze is the worried father who takes his kids on the run with him for personal reasons and Halle Berry is the cop chasing them down . Overall a decent way to spend a couple hours of your life . You could certainly do worse hear of the film Pod People'' out of Rated PG for some traumatic scenes adult content matter violence and language .
6526_7.txt,1, DVD can be a gamble and this was one that sort of paid off . decent Saturday Night type movie that entertains if you gloss over the obvious plot flaws . Special effects are a bit few and far between with some repetition why does London always look as if it's in the If it had the budget of say Armageddon then I'm sure it would have performed better at the Box Office as the story is quite a good one . Overall Tycus is consigned to movie history but if you see it for then it's worth buying .
2762_8.txt,1, have seen so many bad reviews on Supervivientes de los Andes that felt compelled to stand for it at least I'll try First of all of course that it looks dated it was made in the seventies with very low budget but that's part of it's charm . like contemporary films but also dig the old ones for what they worth . I'm not the one to feel the urge to only see or like movies with modern treatments and effects besides almost every movie buff likes old fashioned motion pictures does n't like films from El Santo or Plan from outer space no matter it's overall quality ? In the aspect of pace is just a tool for covering it's low cost and think the constant dialogs are in order of a better character and situations development . Sure Alive has better FX but wo n't despise the old one just because of that and do n't feel quite attracted to English speakers in an event involving people from Uruguay and for me that gives a plus to Supervivientes de los Andes . It's like even if Canoa from the seventies and based on a true event too would have a better remake now due to the advance of technology but think would stick to that one based on the emotions that offers regardless it's production date . All of this is based in the impact that had on me because the first time saw it was on TV and nowadays do n't think it has lost some of it's primal force . Of course it's been a long time and I've seen tons of better movies in every aspect of cinema but that does n't diminish it's true value . It's not a bad film and place it above Alive without hesitation . Just give it a break .
5060_7.txt,1, An Arab American man is kidnapped from an American Airport and flown to somewhere in North Africa'' where he is tortured . The reason ? His cell phone received a call from a known terrorist . The CIA decides to avoid legal means to determine whether the phone call is implication of guilt or just a mistake . After watching this movie we can only but pray some terrorist does n't accidentally punch in a wrong number ! In addition to the rendition there are several related side stories . One involves the daughter of the chief of intel police ? who is torturing the suspect and her involvement with her lover who happens to be in night school for suicide bombers . This story is way too contrived but nevertheless intriguing especially when we see it's outcome . The Director uses a neat time line switcheroo to hook the audience . The second side story is the attempt by the suspects wife to find out what happened to her missing husband . She gets an old lover to help . He muted Saarsgard is aide de camp to a Senator and soon gets cold feet when he realizes that his job is n't worth uncovering the truth . Witherspoon is wasted in this role . All she gets to do is look forlorn and pregnant with one brief rage attack . Streep is good and cold and stereotypical as the govt . Sec ? official who seems to be a Cheney clone . Gylenhall also is wasted as a minor analyst pushed into in area he's over his head in although he gets to do the right thing'' in the end . found the movie engrossing if somewhat languorous but thought it added little to the subject . It is certainly not to be viewed as definitive and it certainly has an axe to grind . Like The Kingdom'' it scratches the surface of a very complicated subject . The movie tries hard to give us an idea about rendition but can only end up by being a cautionary tale'' about one botched one . The whole point of rendition is not to torture'' but to get terror suspects'' to give intel by avoiding legal obstructive barriers . Torture for sure may be employed especially if the rendition is out of our hands although we are obviously not guiltless in this matter but intel that can save lives is vital in this shadow war .
1509_8.txt,1, could n't help but relish the entire premise of CAT IN THE BRAIN because it dutifully explains a director's steadily going mad seeing people murdered from past movies he has made . Even mundane activities such as cooking a meal in the microwave or running a faucet of water yield some horrific butchery from a film in the past . Director Fulci playing himself is directing GHOSTS OF SODOM can not seem to deprive his mental well being from constant murder . He seeks help from a psychiatrist who instead uses Fulci's work as a method to execute a series of innocent people hypnotizing the director into thinking that perhaps he's responsible . This is obviously a film playfully poking fun at Fulci's image while exploring the themes of how such a profession which produces so much death and destruction rarely untamed could mold and shape a legacy . The film features pretty much a wrap story surrounding non graphic violence with every possible way to kill a woman expressed in grisly detail . This has a shower murder Hitchcock never could direct or probably want to . The film's savagery compliments the mental state of Fulci's Fulci know the running time . Reality and cinematic fiction have fused and Fulci can find no escape . The ending the old clich only a movie'' work any better than it does here . Fulci's boat says Perversion touch he sails off . can only wish this was his final film because that's a perfect close if there ever was one . David Thompson is the deranged psychiatrist planning to kill his adulterous wife . Jeoffrey Kennedy is a cop Fulci fears had a family murdered by the fiend . The ultra in the film features plenty of unique ways to take a head off such as the door to a chest a scythe a chainsaw and hatchet . The most brutal violence derives from nasty chainsaw activity as a dead body is hacked to pieces a gardener's chainsaw work on a log fits beautifully in one nightmarish hallucination sequence most shocking use of a chainsaw is when a little boy gets decapitated ! The opening scene with the puppet cat tearing away feasting on Fulci's brain is a howler . The scenes which are spliced within the film featuring a horrified Fulci looking on are obvious but could n't help but enjoy this anyway .
8248_8.txt,1, David master of debonair'' Niven plays the Big Boss who preys upon the unfortunate Richard Jordan by forcing the hapless ex to exploit his ill new position in a bank . Elke Sommer PELHAM most effectively provides the female interest whom Pinkie can not simply can not resist . It seems they were unable to decide on one name for this film so instead they used four makes sense Sadly this turn out to be one of Niven's last roles . Overall this film is fun and well worth watching if you manage to catch one of its rare or late night TV screenings .
3648_10.txt,1, People who say that some of what the Looney Tunes cartoons show is inappropriate for children have apparently forgotten something they were n't originally intended for children . They were produced for the cinema to be shown before feature films and so they could show anything that they wanted . Tweety's has that bad puddy tat Sylvester finding Tweety aboard an ocean liner and boarding the ship to try and get him . But two things work against Sylvester Granny is vehemently protecting the canary and Sylvester easily gets seasick do n't see him throwing up but with his green face they make it perfectly clear that he was doing just that ! And then of course the seemingly cute Tweety has a bad streak . It's just great to see how these cartoons were n't afraid to go all out whatever they thought about showing they showed . We need to understand that cartoons were n't always supposed to be cute entertainment for children . Really funny .
11780_8.txt,1, Done on a spare change budget of twenty bucks tops this cheapie thirteen minute short cheerfully parodies George Lucas legendary sci blockbuster Star Wars'' in the most infectiously dumb way imaginable . Writer Ernie Fosselius delivers a winning and often gut blend of ludicrous sound effects ineptly staged action scenes cruddy from special effects just got ta love the cheesy scratched lasers tinfoil asteroids and household appliances eer mean spaceships being swung around on obvious wires badly dubbed in dialogue shamelessly hammy acting and Richard Wagner's rousing piece of classical music Ride of the Valkyries . The characters are presented in suitably broad strokes my favorites are whiny wimp Fluke Starbucker venerable Jedi knight Auggie Ben'' Doggie and hateful arch villain Darph Nader spouts nothing but incomprehensible gibberish Moreover is clearly based on the Tin Man from The Wizard of Oz'' while Artie Deco is definitely a cheap vacuum cleaner . This film's true masterstroke is casting legendary voice actor supreme Paul Frees as the narrator Frees deliciously rich and plummy histrionic tones add immensely to the considerable silly yet sidesplitting tongue merriment lines You'll laugh ! You'll cry ! You'll kiss three bucks goodbye ! total hoot .
11314_8.txt,1, Before seeing this picture was quite skeptic do n't like movies with an agenda nor do appreciate being scared into thinking like the writer . was also afraid this would be like the mini which had a far concept little relation to the real world and very poor execution . At the beginning is says This film is fiction but the events portrayed and the information about UK emergency planning are based on extensive research'' and the general feeling is that you're not being sold on an idea but that you're being taught a lesson in civil awareness . The message that is being conveyed is obvious from the start It is coming and we're not prepared . The use of real places and a scenario which not only could happen There are plans for when it does all add to the disturbing effect the movie will have on even the most cynical of viewers . The movie's perspective is that of the society and it stays away from heart personal moments which wo n't convey the message so none of the Romeo drama we're used to .
3164_10.txt,1, Completely worth checking out . Saw it on MLK's birthday and it hit me big time . Sometimes it feels like we're all in a trap and are doomed to repeat the past no matter how much we try to change . All we can do is to keep on going and speaking out . Just keep on going . Do n't mean to be a downer because that's not the point but maybe we need to get down before we see how much we need to work on ourselves . What happens when we keep being told by the best people like MLK what needs to happen to pull us out of our dead end road'' but we do n't listen . know that some of us do listen but how do we get the rest of the world to see things as they really are ? Just keep going guess . This movie got me thinking even more about all of this so guess it has done what it set out to do . That's what consider to be a good movie or play or book or poem or speech or anything something that gets you thinking and keyed up to move in an active direction instead of sitting stuck and bored and hopeless .
11106_7.txt,1, Late night on BBC was on my way to bed but curiosity piqued at a contemporary Irish film so stayed to watch for a few minutes and then stayed to the end . have to admit that the main attraction was the only English actress Kelly Reilly who is stunning to look at . This is billed as a black comedy which is one of the hardest things to pull off . It should be the perfect blend of horror and horrible laughs so that in the end you do n't know why you're laughing for me Martin Scorsese's After Hours is the best example . Dead Bodies is more black than comedy but the plot rattles along and spirals down towards further blackness . did n't spot the final twists in the tale as some other posters here did so was suitably surprised . As a snapshot of the Irish film industry in it all seems rather worthy it does n't look like they spent too much on the making of it so it had a chance to make its money back . The script could've been a whole lot sharper but the acting was on the whole pretty good . I'm glad watched it flaws and all tho do n't think learnt much about Ireland today especially their policing methods !
2926_7.txt,1, Although this episode was offensive to the Tourette Syndrome Association others thought it was funny while others thought it was a bad way to start the new season . This episode was funny and just shocking . South Park has made history as being their first episode with the most cuss words unless you count the movie as an episode . enjoyed how they made fun of Chris Hansen and his television show to Catch a Predator . did n't like the idea on how they thought Chris Hansen would do a show on tourettes and let a boy speak out and bash the Jews . One thing did not like is how South Park thought that people with tourettes syndrome would just blurt out bad language like that . I've seen people on television with Tourettes syndrome and they do not just blurt out bad words . Unless am incorrect .
4959_10.txt,1, Okay here's the deal . There's this American pilot who's flying along minding his own business when suddenly he's outnumbered by evil cowardly non fighter planes Middle Eastern types but suffice to say they do n't like apple pie or Elvis Presley who proceed to shoot him down . Now this American pilot was doing nothing wrong but those evil non did n't care and before you know it he's banged up in a foreign jail and sentenced to death ! Now what would normally happen here is that the US Military would carpet bomb a couple of nearby towns until the pilot was released but not this time . Those evil peace lovin types probably got involved and managed to stop any kind of retaliatory massacre . As you can imagine this does n't please the pilot's family and the evil foreign dictator has this smug contented look about him . He'll make those Americans pay oh yes indeed ! But He did n't reckon on Doug Masters the captured pilots son . You see Doug has been able to fly a plane longer than he can drive a car ca n't be that long and decides to fly into that evil foreign country and get his Dad back . So with the help of his friends Doug and his wingman retired pilot Sinclair Doug launches a two man air raid on the foreigners . Now you'd think that this plan would be bound to fail but you'd be wrong . Sure those Middle Eastern types might be all veteran pilots but Doug's got an ace up his sleeve he listens to rock music when he flies ! After shooting down a dozen or so enemy planes and blowing up an oil refinery Doug lands at an airport and gets his now wounded dad onboard the plane . Understandably the evil not quite so smug anymore dictator gets quite annoyed at these antics and takes to the skies himself in bid to shoot down Doug . But the young lad listens to some more rock music and blows the villain out of the sky . HURRAH ! After Doug and Chappy have shot down of their air force the foreigners send up their last few planes in a rather poor attempt to shoot Doug down but in the nick of time a flight of US turn up and scare them away . can not recommend this film enough . It was the first ever videocassette movie that brought and until was twenty kept hoping that my dad would get shot down over a foreign country so that could rescue him . But he's does n't like flying so it did n't happen .
7397_7.txt,1, The problem with so many people watching this movie is the mindset they watch it in . People come looking for a horror film or a So Bad It's Good'' movie . Jack Frost is neither of these . It is to put it simply a very good movie cleverly hidden inside a very bad one . To view it as anything other than a screwball comedy funnier than all three absolutely meritless Scary Movies'' combined is to misinterpret the movie on a basic level . It would be like watching Shawshank Redemption and then complaining that there were no explosions . The premise is simple the characters from the first movie haunted by memories of Jack Frost take a vacation to a tropical island . new improved Jack comes after them now with essentially the powers of Hydro from Spider essentially he can turn from water to snow easily and quickly divide himself multiply himself and worst of all he's managed to grow an immunity to his only former weakness . What's sad about this movie is that the brain dead fans of the first Jack Frost simply HORRIBLE movie ca n't appreciate the change of tone for the sequel . Just as Alien was a horror film and Aliens was all about action Jack Frost was a weak attempt at gimmick horror and Jack Frost is a cleverly written parody of the gimmick horror genre . Most of the entertainment comes the live action actors who serve admirably . Particularly funny among them are Ray Tooney a caricature of a retired British Colonel from the early Christopher Allport an insane hilarious spin on his wooden performance from the first film and David Allen Brooks the once serious role of manners to new totally bizarre heights The lack of memorable quotes'' disturbs me . As a horror movie Jack Frost Revenge of The Mutant Killer Snowman rates a zero . But you have to understand IT'S NOT HORROR MOVIE .
4859_10.txt,1, This movie packs a punch . There are a few every now and then that make me think deeply and disturb me a lot . could see myself in this same predicament passively allowing things to happen around me not standing up for the right and decent thing just trying to avoid trouble . How often do we avoid making waves or sticking our necks out ? How often does our inaction condone the evil actions of others . We would never join them we tell ourselves we recognize that what they are doing is bad but do we do anything about it ? Lawrence Newman Macey is a low nerdy office worker who has paid off his home in Brooklyn NY in the waning days of World War II . He rarely gets engaged in what is going on around him has never married rarely socializes just goes to work and cares for his invalid mother . Then a series of events in his very white'' little neighborhood pull him out of his complacent shell into a maelstrom of events . It starts as he witness from his bedroom window the rape of a Puerto Rican girl by the son of his neighbor . Soon after he gets glasses because of poor vision . As he is now better able to see he becomes less able to deal with the circumstances of his life . The one bright spot is a new love in his life and he marries hoping to continue on in his normalcy . Then the virulent anti on that street catches him despite his credentials as a Presbyterian WASP . As things spiral further out of control he discovers he must make an important decision does he take a stand or does he simply go away . can not how anybody can view this movie without being affected and having to think very much about themselves and what they really stand for . Post war anti is the setting here but there is injustice at all times and in all places . It is for the individual to decide where he or she stands .
11208_10.txt,1, Hysterically painful perhaps the kind of movie Chekhov would have made had he made movies . What's really funny is that the two cousins have so very much in common descriptions of their relationship on this site are dead wrong What's really funny and uncomfortable about these characters is that they just ca n't bring themselves to talk to each other or anyone else ! It's horrible . If you've ever been too shy worried self or just plain scared to talk to someone who has n't ? you'll definitely see yourself in this film . And it wo n't be pretty . It holds a mirror up to the audience and says If you do n't like what you see . change it''
6397_7.txt,1, This show was crap when it first came on . The first actress that played the daughter did n't fit the role the writing was hit or miss and Damon Wayans CLEARLY was n't comfortable doing such a cornball family friendly show . The chemistry between himself and Tisha Cambell long time friends as are all of the Wayans clan with Tisha's husband and Will Smith and Jada Pinkett DID work so they retooled the show . Once it returned they recast the daughter made the son much dumber la Eric from Boy Meets World'' made the youngest daughter into a genius . they gave her a little genius boyfriend to do comedic guest appearances The show while if often rollercoasters from over the top buffoonery to being corny walks the line enough to keep it as a show that you can see Damon Wayans be comfortable in his own skin on the set since the main writers directors and consultants were ALL members of the Wayans family AND in his character . Once everyone had been on the show for a while they worked to everyone in the casts strengths and were able to make a consistently funny show on the air . However there is TOO MUCH buffoonery too many over the top antics and oftentimes too much chaos happening in the life of the Kyle family . They made Junior TOO STUPID they also made the eldest daughter an attractive clumsy idiot from time to time and the youngest daughter was n't even spared by the writers . feel they jumped the shark and signed the shows death warrant when Junior got his girlfriend pregnant she moved in and he married her and her parents were introduced wife's father's character makes me WINCE just thinking about him The show remained funny . it was a UPN show on ABC if that makes any sense to the reader . The reruns are funny enough but I'm relieved it's over . was nowhere left to go with it . When it's bad it's REALLY BAD . It tends to be cornball at times but at least he was a black man who had a sitcom make it to syndication on a major network . can say that for themselves now ? the CW merger and the brownout'' on TV networks lately that is One .
3963_7.txt,1, This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not intelligence and good messages . Accepted is the story of a kid named Bartleby Long who gets rejected by every college he applies to . His parents are incredibly strict frustrated and disappointed . So Bartleby and a few other students who face similar problems start a fake college to pawn themselves off to their parents as college kids . Not everything goes to plan and the movie is about them winging it . But behind this plot which sounds ridiculous there are good messages morals and a new outlook on the American educational system . The college they create South Harmon Institute of Technology'' accepts those who did not get accepted anywhere else . The message is that you do not need money tradition or fancy books you just need a desire to better yourself . they are a completely unorthodox school but what the movie teaches is that thats still OK and different its a person or a school is not necessarily bad and that every one no matter should be given the chance to better themselves despite whether they are its a message of non and has traces of anti sprinkled in as well . But not only are messages great its hilarious ! haha laughed very hard . the humor can be subtle but can also be blatant as well and is a great mix . Fraternities beware .
9031_9.txt,1, It's too bad iameracing wants to deny the reality of Faulkner's and Clarence Brown's purpose in the creating of the story and film of Intruder In The Dust'' suppose the burden of a history of racism is difficult for any Southerner to bear and can understand that . But to say that this film was not specifically about racism is ridiculous and inaccurate . YES borrow your use of the upper case iameracing there are many many many places where blacks and white people in the South get along quite well . But to deny the way that black people were and sometimes still are forced to live the conditions and injustices they have had to endure are not imaginary . Sometimes black and white people got along because of genuine affection and understanding . Sometimes it was only as long as blacks their place The point of making Juano Hernandez character film and print a somewhat prickly type not warm and fuzzy was to underscore the fact that bigotry is wrong in and of itself and human rights are just that for everyone regardless of whether we like a particular individual or not . It would do iameracing good to stop denying the existence of racism and the great harm it has done to Americans of all stripes . The fact is that black people others did not as a rule not an exception receive the benefits of the justice system as even as whites . Segregation discrimination and lynching are historical fact . People like iameracing might claim these things were not as widespread as some think and would probably love to exonerate their ancestors and heroes from any connection with such behavior . It would be a wonderful thing if iameracing's Southern ancestors any participated in any of the horrible racist actions that mar this country's history and hope they did n't . If that is so congratulations to them but that fact if true does not erase the fact that others did . And even if the horrible things that were done to blacks in the South other areas let's not forget the Draft Riots of the Civil War Era only half as numerous only a third does that make them any less horrible ? Is the murder of ten children the hanging of ten men the sexual assault of ten women any less horrible than the same things happening to a hundred ? Iameracing asks us to get the Mississippi Burning'' chip off of our shoulders before we see Intruder In The Dust'' well ask you did the murders of the civil rights activists happen or not ? Why should that be forgotten ? Forgiven ? Maybe . But in order to prevent their recurrence they can not be forgotten or revised into minor occurrences . The racism that is displayed in Intruder In The Dust'' is displayed there quite purposely . It is there to make a point . On a cinematically historical level it is also ridiculous for iameracing to discount the racial angle . Any viewer of films that were filmed before the knows that black actors were usually deliberately cast . To judge from our movie history wars were always fought by middle aged white men There were no black people in the Old West it was possible to walk down a street in a major city and never encounter a black person there were no black hospital orderlies drivers salespeople etc . Blacks were almost never cast with regard to a role unless race was a factor . If Falukner Brown had wanted to tell a simple murder story he probably would not have made the Hernandez character black . Racism exists iameracing . Probably for different reasons am sure we both wish that it did n't but it does . Wanting things to be the way we would like them to be probably ca n't be helped but it still does not make them so .
2675_7.txt,1, Just want to inform you guys that this movie was actually pretty good Thought it was a lame ass movie but not at all many moments in this movie wore pretty horrifying . This movie has enough blood gore and some sexy make out scenes of course to keep any horror buff like me satisfied ! The cast was also pretty good IMO . Even though its not a high budget movie the effects wore definitely kinda creepy sometimes . Worth watching if like a kick ass horror movie thats for sure ! Tom
7120_10.txt,1, There are few films that deal with things that would consider myself an expert on this one is . After some years of Fantasy Role Playing we split me not leaving without a sense of shame of what had become a dork . You see these things are really canonical it happens to everybody . First you create a character fairly and it dies after the first attack . Then you help a little with the constitution and while you're at it why not help with strength intelligence intuition charisma and dexterity too ? This in turn frustrates the game master who does n't know how to deal with this invincible gang . And after a while it bores the players too so they start to create ever more exotic race combinations no matter how ludicrous it is . created a Druedain warrior monk yeah not that far from the film . And that's not all to be said about the destructiveness of the inherent dynamic of this devilish game the hunt for experience points but just watch the film it shows it all and of course the stupidity of its most basic premisses . For this end in turn there is no better profession than the bard . do n't exactly understand why the bard became a character in the first place after all the blacksmith is none . But once it became one it had to be mapped into the game flow that is it had to be made lethal at least indirectly . The poking of fun out of this never comes to an end and rightfully so . Sure it's not exactly a professional production but have n't seen a better satire in ages .
7730_8.txt,1, really liked this film not so much for the story was okay but was a bit slow in spots but moreso for the incredibly beautiful scenery of Greece and the Greek isles ! Susan Sarandon is utterly engaging as the carefree love interest of John Cassavetes a man on the edge'' But the scenery ! Oh oh oh !
3688_7.txt,1, am a huge Rupert Everett fan . adore Kathy Bates so when saw it available decided to check it out . The synopsis did n't really tell you much . In parts it was silly touching and in others some parts were down right hysterical . Any person that is a huge fan of a personality of any type will find some small identifying traits with the main character . course there are many they wo n't but that is the point If you like any of the actors give it a watch but do n't look for any thing too dramatic it's good fun . might also mention you can see how darn tall Rupert is . mean knew he was but he seems even more in this film . He even seemed to stoop a bit due to the other characters height in this . He is tall ! mean tall ! And for you Rupert fans there is a bare chest scene .
8089_9.txt,1, This satire is just really really dead and nobody is spared . But even though this movie has plenty of laughs within the silly story and the grotesque imitation of Hitler cleverly renamed as Hynkel'' and speaking in a hilarious kind of pseudo the general tone is pretty sad maybe because of the movie's place in history . And the actors are n't even exaggerating that much suppose . One of the greatest movie moments of all time must be the Jewish barber's ending speech if only things could have ended in that way . It's not even really the character talking anymore it's Chaplin saying something he really wanted to say . If you ignore the technical aspects the movie does n't feel dated or old it actually moves at a pretty nice pace . And the sharp humor we find everywhere in this work will never die the only thing do n't care for is the slapstick but that just comes with the era suppose . This is an incredibly daring harsh take on fascism it's so hard still after all these years .
212_7.txt,1, Nothing like this was seen on TV at that time and probably never will again . From the first image of that police light blinding you and from there you heard the words Police Squad in color'' you were schocked to see that this in no way was an ordinary sitcom . Also to kill off a Guest Star'' and then never refer to him again where had you ever seen that before . Then the actual show started and if you did not pay attention you would miss several jokes in the background . Do n't pay too much attention to one thing or you would be sorry . This was the show that video recorders were made for way before Married with Children or The Simpsons . The stories did in no way make sense and the dialog was sometimes so weird that you had to think about it for minutes before realising that it was a joke . The characters Frank Drebin and Ed Hocken came right out of Dragnet and they were absolutely straight funny accents or expressions but instead there were puns and twisted sentences played absolutely deadpan . Only once as can remember were there a segment played for silly laughs a scene involving a trip to a dentist suction and a whole lot of saliva . There were some tedious moments like the informer Johnny and an appearance by some celebrity . That was strictly a one moment but they had to use it in all six episodes . Oh well . Everything ca n't be perfect . The important thing is that the rest of the time you were knee deep in tears of laughter . Leslie Nielsen was fortunate that this revived his career when they put the Frank Drebin character in features but it must have been an Achilles heel as well . Can you remember seeing him in anything except Naked Gun type work since ? And do n't count the awful Mr. Magoo reworked for live action . He probably made a lot of money though .
11404_8.txt,1, was skeptical before going to this because of the horribly assembled trailer which made it look like an equally horrible movie . was nicely surprised by how much did not waste my money . believe the films success comes from how creepy it really is and how the environment of the house is . Little things like the sensor lights create a true uneasy feeling . The shadows and ominously cold feeling of the house make it easy to tell that no matter how much you know horror films anything could happen in the film . The acting is by no means perfect nor were they bad . The main character is convincing even given the annoying teen dramas that surround her . In the end was thoroughly impressed with the film in most aspects . It is definitely a film would recommend .
2795_7.txt,1, AHEAD It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to be such a disappointment . thought this was full of clich and that it basically tried to hard . To the guys out there how many of you spend your time jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkey sounds ? To the girls how many of you have suddenly gone from prudes to nymphos overnight not with your husband ? To the French would you really ask about someone being la fac'' when you know they do n't speak French ? Would n't you use a more common word like universit lived in France for a while and sort of do know and understand Europe love it but my roommate and found this pretty insulting overall . It looked like a movie funded by the European Parliament and it tried too hard basically . It had all sorts of differences that it tried to tie together a bad thing in itself but the result is at best awkward but in fact ridiculous many clashes that would n't really happen . Then the end of the movie last minutes all the rest . Why does n't Xavier talk to the Erasmus students he meets back in Paris ? Why does he just walk off ? Why does he just run away from his job is that freedom'' And in the end is the new Europe supposed to rest on bunch of people who smoke up and shag all day ? Is this what it's made up of ? Besides the acting was pretty horrible . ca n't believe Judith Godr role and acting . Why was she made to look like Emanuelle so much ? At first thought Xavier was OK but with retrospect think he was pretty bad . And that's all really too bad because technically credits scenes when he's asking what papers he needs it was really good for sound editing around the British siblings and the soundtrack was great too . So the form was good but the content pretty horrible .
2880_10.txt,1, The problem with other actors cast in the of Dorian Gray is that they either looked too old for the part Hatfield Helmut Berger Josh Duhamel David Gallagher Ben Barnes or that they were unable to pull off the English aristocratic manner without being stilted . Dorian is the perpetual so all milky skin and honey'd locks as described by Wilde so the challenge is finding an actor that has the maturity and range for the part who can portray the naivit callousness and manipulativeness but at the same time looks like someone in his late teens . And Peter Firth pulls it all off in this excellent British TV adaptation . Gielgud as Henry Wotton while considerably older than what Wilde had in mind does wonders with his scenes aphorisms have never sounded so natural and unforced . Especially George Sanders in the version was pretty feeble by comparison his costume did n't fit Finally Jeremy Bratt plays Basil as the most masculine and at the same time the most gay of the trio again a fitting interpretation . In general the film includes enough gay subtext without turning Dorian himself gay all things to all people and supposedly there's no drug or sexual perversion he has n't tried in the years covered by the story but that makes him more narcist than homosexual . He seems to equally wreak havoc on both sexes here as he should according to the novel . Of course the budget of this production was not very large so everything feels a little stagey . Particularly Dorian's encounter with Sybil's brother suffers from the obvious studio look . Also the final shot of Dorian puppet suppose in his white toad make is more hilarious than convincing and Basil's death scene is inadvertently funny . as far as recall Basil should have been killed seated at the table . But all in all this is a very worthy adaptation . I'm sure Wilde would have liked it . The only thing missing is the sensual side . Not so much sex scenes but Wilde's decadent world of fragrant flowers luxurious cloths and precious gems is n't really explored here the aestheticism is completely missing . But like Claudius'' the excellent acting makes one easily forget these shortcomings of production values .
5276_8.txt,1, Okay if this film had been made much later in the history of cinema it would n't be particularly worthwhile . However in films were in their infancy and they were almost all rather dull and had no real story to tell just showing normal everyday folks doing everyday activities . If seen today almost all of them are hopelessly dull and very very short less than one minute long ! And so in light of this this short clip of a movie is pretty swell stuff and might just make you laugh . Two guys a miller and a chimney sweep bump into each other and throwing flour and coal dust all over each other as they tussle . THAT'S ALL film is over before you know it .

12356_10.txt,1, Yeah guess this movie is kinda dull compared to some of Pam Grier's other films . The plot is overly familiar the dialog stilted and some of the acting is n't too good . But it's worth seeing for the lengthy stretch near the end of the film where we see Ms Grier in a sexy blue wetsuit with the zipper half unzipped . Yeah it seems like a frivolous point when discussing an actress of Pam Grier's talent but she also happens to be an extremely gorgeous woman and back in the day she had a body that would n't quit . It's nice to see it being showcased in a tight wetsuit . Rent the DVD and then tell me I'm wrong . Ca n't can you ? That's because you know I'm right ! And yes really did give a just for the wetsuit scenes !
6270_10.txt,1, The Ator series is a shining example of what should be . They fail in every aspect but in such a hilarious way that they are funny rather than sad . Ator l'invincibile aka The Blade Master'' aka Cave Dwellers'' shows us Europe's favorite Conan clone Ator where we left him in the first movie after showing us a lengthy recap of all the events of the first film . This time the world must be saved from The Nucleus'' a kind of bomb represented on screen as a bright light guess they could n't afford a prop This one features invisible attackers and samurai . As with the first film lots of stock footage is used one rather obvious bit from Star Wars'' Thoroughly laughable and unforgettably bad this is an exception
2181_7.txt,1, This cheapo remake of the terrific Five Star Final suffers from terrible acting . Humphrey Bogart stars as the manager of a sleazoid radio station that is desperate to boost sagging ratings . The owner decides to have a series of morality plays written about a famous murder case from years ago . So they hire the fake preacher Hayden to track down the murderess who was acquitted and has been living quietly under a fake name . The preacher arrive on the daughter's wedding day but the ruthless radio station refuses to back off exposing the mother and ruining their lives . Bogart is always good . Hayden is good the the slimy preacher and Henry O'Neill is good as the father . Everyone else is just awful . Helen McKeller wins no sympathy for the role Linda Perry is a lousy actress Beverly Roberts is OK but always looks old Claire Dodd and Hobart Cavanagh have no parts Carlyle Moore is a dud as the boy friend Virginia Brissac is miscast as the society mother Robert Middlemas overacts as the station owner . This one comes in under an hour but is a pale copy of the original which boasted dynamic performances by Edward Robinson Aline MacMahon Frances Starr and Boris Karloff . But it's always worth watching Boagrt .
7336_7.txt,1, one . What came to my mind immediately was Loving Annabelle as it has this same kind of mature mood and distanced dealing with the subject . We simply observe as the story unfolds without taking sides or having to confront any moral'' issues of course we are but are not spoon them Sure there were some difficult facts to face and choices to make but it just flowed . Basically it was just like any other love story in any other life with any other sexes . personally found the girls having a good chemistry and had fun with them on their night outs . The only thing could really pinpoint as a problem would be it just felt kind of . Held back . It's not about the sex scenes those missing but given that felt the film at its liveliest during the moments they were together having a good time it kind of contrasted with the rest . Lowkey is good but it just never quite sizzled like Loving Annabelle nor touched me quite as much . This said heartily recommend it it's by no means a waste of ones precious time on the contrary .
9439_9.txt,1, What's the most violent movie of all time ? Rambo III ? Commando ? Robocop ? Add these three very violent together and you still wo n't equal the carnage in The Stabilizer the wildest silliest craziest action movie have ever seen . For one hundred minutes things blow up and people die in dozens of strange ways . It will make you laugh and cheer and when it's all over you'll be more than a little exhausted . This movie is a buried gem a cult classic sadly lacking a cult . The Stabilizer is the nickname of our hero Peter Goldson O'Brian a large oily man with a curly mullet . He arrives in Indonesia on the trail of the villainous and mean Greg Rainmaker . We know he is evil because he is only referred to by his full name hate SCUM like Greg RAINmaker ! and utilizes a method of killing that is so horrible ca n't even utter it here . Wait yes can . He steps on people in spiky shoes . Greg Rainmaker Cleat Killer . When Greg Rainmaker is n't pouring alcohol on women for their sexual pleasure he's kidnapping important professors and heading a huge underworld empire . It's up to Goldson Jewish action hero ? Gevalt ! and his motley crew of sidekicks to stabilize the situation by killing everyone and blowing lots of stuff up . Maybe stabilize'' has a different meaning in Indonesia . And the violence oh the violence . This is a film unwilling nay uncapable of letting five minutes of screen time go by without some sort of explosion knifing car crash or squib interrupting the dialogue . The violence is extreme not graphic and bloody just really weird . For example The Stabilizer company invade one of Rainmaker's warehouses driving through a solid concrete wall on a motorcycle of course When perched on the balcony with heavy fire coming from below The Stabilizer does the one thing he can do . He drives off the balcony into the guy's head his front tire bouncing off it like a basketball . Astounding . From the overly love scenes major female characters hop in the sack with the hero of their choice not two minutes after they speak to them alone for the first time to the poorly dubbed dialogue you talented bastard ! The Stabilizer has it all . This is a film for the ages right up there with Citizen Kane and Gymkata . It is not widely available in release . If you find it anywhere for any price buy it and relish the insanity .
10391_9.txt,1, saw this film for the first time last night . have been thinking about it all night and this morning . can not say that it was my favorite film at least not yet . need to see it again . The cinematography is stunning . Each shot has a lyricism that one would expect in a film that has Wim Wenders's name attached to it . It is always tempting to see de Chirico in any picture of rows of orders vanishing into the gloom but in this case the analogy fits . In many ways the figure of Malkovich walking through the fog and wind of Ferarra echoes the shadow of the off statue that haunts Milan in the major works of the Italo painter . He is slightly menacing a presence who watches and in his capacity as a film director exerts influence on the entire story . The dedicated Wenders fan can not help but think a little bit of Damiel and Cassiel wandering through the streets of Berlin watching all but not directly interacting with the inhabitants . And following the Himmel Uber Berlin metaphor the angel in this case Malkovich the Director gets to interact with one of the stories . At this point have to bow out of taking this line of criticism too far . need to see the movie again . am fairly sure that this is the thread that will bring Malkovich's monologue together . Perhaps his musings and pontifications are pretentious empty dialog that sound good but can not possibly be parsed into real communication . Maybe that is the whole point of it . No one can make that judgment with any degree of certainty or authority until having done his homework . We must be careful when throwing around the word pretentious . It is easy to write off anything that smacks of the intellect as pretension but that leads to a terrifying mental state one in which the only conversation seen as genuine earthy or authentic is the most banal . When we shun all discussions of philosophy God existence meaning and all that brain candy we are setting our culture up to die a slow stupid and ugly death . Perhaps this is the warning that Wenders and Antonioni are giving us . It certainly is not the only theme of the film but think that it can not be ignored . The other most obvious leitmotif is that of satisfaction . There is a lot here on that and a thorough review of all the subtleties and consequences of the development of this leitmotif would well exceed the word limit for this review . My advice is to see the film . But offer a caveat it is not an autonomous film least do n't think so yet Some films interact with the intellectual and artistic thinking of their times so much that the viewer needs to have a background in the Zeitgeist before approaching the film . Par les nuages is one of those films .
4341_7.txt,1, LOL . The mere fact that start off my review with says it all . used to watch this movie all the time as a kid and even then sensed the silliness of it all . The low budget horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then . watched it again yesterday and just could n't stop laughing . It's so bad it's actually good lol . Like another reviewer said it does n't take itself seriously . There's no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so . The soundtrack is so funny laugh every time hear it . The is just a laugh riot . It's an all out war zone in New York full of explosions and total chaos . ridiculous you ca n't help but chuckle at the sight of it . Other hilarious moments The scene with Kersey and the cop running side by side like cowboys against the whole Wild West was so cheesy it was funny . killed me how the bad guys could be shooting at Kersey and he could even drop down on one knee taking ever slow aim and not get hit LMAO . Of course with him it was one shot kill with his elephant handgun LOL . Another hilarious scene was the end when he finally killed the leader of the gang . a ROCKET LAUNCHER lol . the whole side of the apartment building with it . It's apparent that Kersey is all but used to losing loved ones . his new girlfriend is quickly disposed of after only a few dates . The acting is so bad that you ca n't blame anyone that could only think that Kersey is mad at the destruction of the car lol . runs down looks at the carnage and just walks away . Again so bad it's good . out of stars .
7943_9.txt,1, At school was taught how some shots were called and there were two directors constantly mentioned Orson Welles and Sergei Eisenstein . did n't care that much then was a kid ! but now know why Eisenstein is a genius and it is a shame to see what was possible in where as almost more than a half century we're stuck with countless blank movies ! Some say this movie is n't worth the genius of Eisenstein they have to watch it over and over till they can say anything bad or even worse that it is just some propagandamovie for the Russians . Let's say it as it is it is indeed pure propaganda for patriotism but is n't Saving private Ryan'' or The longest day'' so ? could sum up so many movies in where America is being raised to the top so why not Russia and besides every war is fought for itrs patriotism why else would they raise flags ? Aleksandr Nevsky is a must for anyone who cares about cinematography as almost every shot is a sublime picture . Perhaps it's all overseen but am in wonder why this is n't included in IMDB's Top where as there is so many overrated Oscarcrap in it as well .
11185_10.txt,1, The Curse of Monkey Island . Released excactly years after the success of Monkey Island You would think with Monkey Island wierd ending that it would finish Monkey Island once and for all . But it all turned out to be a trick to lure Guybrush into captivity . But enough about that the whole jist of this is that Monkey Island has returned and the voices are just phenominal . If LucasArts were to make a movie of Monkey Island this would probably be what it would look like and sound like . It's plot is real good and everything about it is just awesome . If you have n't heard about the Monkey Island series buy the Monkey Island Archives or The Monkey Island Booty Pack and play through all the games starting with The Secret of Monkey Island then Monkey Island and The Curse of Monkey Island . Monkey Island was real good but this one tops them all .
9386_7.txt,1, As Roger Corman has said in an interview low film enables film to take chances on offbeat ideas . Well you'd be hard pressed to find a film that thrives on the offbeat as mightily as George Barry's Death Bed The Bed That Eats'' The film does have a back story to it and it's an interesting one at that . I'll forgo relaying any sort of details so you can hear them for yourself if you take a chance on watching it . Suffice it to say the title item of furniture has an insatiable hunger consuming the unwary with a bubbling yellow foam that dissolves its victims like acid . Death Bed'' is an eerie haunting little flick that plays out its absurd premise in such a way that it transcends the usual assortment of schlock fare . It occupies its particular dream world in such a way that it was possible for me to take it seriously . It's a truly strange and unconventional horror flick . It dabbles in exploitative ingredients there's some tasty dollops of female nudity and yet is also art albeit art with a completely skewed sensibility . The special effects are not too bad for a film with a microscopic budget and Barry gives the film a good and atmospheric midnight movie'' quality . The acting from the cast is as uninspired as one could imagine although Patrick Spence lends a reasonable amount of gravitas as the artist narrator and one definite point of interest is seeing one familiar face on hand future Meets World father William Russ ! This film might not have even found the small cult following that it does have were it not for pirated copies making the rounds this certainly has to rank as one of the instances where such a practice ultimately ended up helping the film even if the exposure took years to take hold . If you have a taste for truly bizarre obscure items Death Bed'' may be just what you've got in mind .
4800_10.txt,1, Nazarin is some kind of saint wants to live in life exactly how Christ taught man to do . it's too late the Catholic Church is between the hands of a wealthy bourgeoisie bishops live in luxury and do n't give a damn about the poor and the sick . why our hero ca n't follow the way his hierarchy asks him to follow . he divests himself of everything on his way to purity joined by some kind of Mary Magdelene and a woman who's attracted by him sexually scene between this girl and her fianc is telling Spain was the late fifties thought Nazarin was a Christian movie ! Luis Bunuel was downright incongruous his work is anticlerical to a fault . Nazarin and his holy women'' to Jesus is a nonsense . Nazarin's way brambles and couch grass grow . attempt at helping working men on the road is a failure chased out as a strike his words amount to nothing . the end of the journey arrested and offered a pineapple by a woman sexual symbol Thanks to Nazarin'' was allowed to return to Spain the censors had not got a clue and to direct Viridiana''
4534_7.txt,1, guess do not have too much to add . found the comedy to still be funny after more than ten years since it came out . The one thing that did notice was the music during the dialogue to be distracting and often made the movie very hook than it should have been . The use of songs is fine during the movie but the orchestral background is too busy too contrived and if the movie was ever to be edited for DVD would seriously recommend that the background music be toned down to an almost inaudible level . It has cheapened the overall feel for the whole film and can see subconsciously why a lot of people have passed it up . The film had a lot of levels working for it on the script plot and comedy level . It is too bad that the producer and director felt they needed the musical schlock to enhance the mood . Now knowing this find it hard to watch and quietly curse whoever was involved with the musical editing in the film . It had all the subtlety of a jackhammer .
1525_10.txt,1, This little two movie is actually much bigger than it looks . It has so many layers . I've watched it over and over and always pick up on something new . am amazed at the depth of the acting and feel if this movie had gotten wider release that there would be no question that Alan Rickman is a major star
7474_9.txt,1, saw this movie by accident while in Paris . went into the wrong theater by accident and by the time realized it was n't a preview or a short film was hooked . Paulina does a phenomenal job of holding your attention with her acting . ca n't say enough how impressed was with her portrayal of this real femme fatal . The rest of the cast performs very well too . Do n't get me wrong this is not the greatest film ever made but given knew nothing about it was left with a lasting and very positive impression . Finally NOT speaking French in France paid off for once ! did n't stop talking about this film for weeks after seeing it .
7624_10.txt,1, guess this is the first movie that made me aware of the term cult flick'' It is totally a bad movie but ca n't help it like this movie . Richard Boone has made better and so has Joan Van Arc but if you are in to staying up late and watching movies that do n't make you think to much this one is for you .
894_7.txt,1, You know you're watching softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you . I'm okay with the crappy lip syncing but the sound mix is really of too . Every time someone says anything it sounds like there's a narrator . Either way this is pretty much the purgatory between boring French professionalism and the heavenly campy Joe D'Amato flicks involving cannibalism and whatnot . Do n't get me wrong there's a fair dose of exploitation in this one but there's always room for more . Laura Gemser stars and that's good because she's hot . It's a bit freaky how at times you can see her bone structure but she still rules over her white counterpart . You can also make a cool drinking game of how often she takes her kit of . Often . Every reason is good . Every person is good . Every location is good . One scene even involves an entire hockey team whatever they are doing in Africa . Sometimes the plot gets in the way and the supporting cast consists of some really vile looking people but there's enough Laura Gemser for all .
3_7.txt,1, How many movies are there that you can think of when you see a movie like this ? ca n't count them but it sure seemed like the movie makers were trying to give me a hint . was reminded so often of other movies it became a big distraction . One of the borrowed memorable lines came from a movie from Day After Tomorrow . One line by itself is not so bad but this movie borrows so much from so many movies it becomes a bad risk . BUT . See The Movie ! Despite its downfalls there is enough to make it interesting and maybe make it appear clever . While borrowing so much from other movies it never goes overboard . In fact you'll probably find yourself battening down the hatches and riding the storm out . Why ? and Kutcher played their characters very well . have never been a fan of Kutcher's and nearly gave up on him in The Guardian but he surfaced in good fashion . Costner carries the movie swimmingly with the best of Costner's ability . do n't think Mrs. Robinson had anything to do with his success . The supporting cast all around played their parts well . had no problem with any of them in the end . But some of these characters were used too much . From here on out can only nit so will save you the wear and tear . Enjoy the movie the parts that work work well enough to keep your head above water . Just do n't expect a smooth ride . of but almost a
854_7.txt,1, This was a surprisingly very good movie and an interesting idea . However it was just a little bit disappointing in that the was a little too predictable and just a bit too early on in the movie . Whilst watching it started to get a little bizarre and confusing to the point that the only reasonable outcome possible was the inevitable plot twist but it certainly did not ruin this movies flow . There were superb performances there was never a dull boring moment so totally well worth watching this one . It kept me interested right up until the end and for me there is n't many movies that can do that these days . highly recommend people watch this terrific little movie .
2297_9.txt,1, really liked this one . It had a really good plot the main female in this movie is really kewl . Despite the fact that she's the only one left alive and her lover dead it seemed to be much like Ninja Scroll . Another kick ass movie . Watch it in japanese with subtitles . do n't know where the idiots who learned to speak english are but for some reason all dubs get an in translation techniques . The subtitles are more correct . Quality Entertainment Replayable
9632_7.txt,1, Man think people have forgotten how to watch a movie . Everyone thinks they're a critic . They comment on things that the average movie goer does n't even know or think about . enjoyed the film . It was what was expecting therefore was not disappointed . Steven gets a bad rap for putting his views into his films but that's also a reason to watch . What's even more funny is the people that complain about his films say he's the worst and that we should n't watch his films yet watch his movies anyway . All so they can comment on how bad they are . Who's the dummy ? If you do n't like his work do n't watch it . Then you wo n't have to subject yourself to this supposedly painful event . Stop comparing movies to other movies and watch a movie on an individual basis and you may begin to enjoy films again .
627_7.txt,1, I've waited years to watch this film simply because never saw it advertised on TV . Eventually caught it and it was well worth the wait . It's much better than your over scream or last summer garbage because it's all at a fairly quick pace with no drawn out creeping through the house to cheesy music scenes . Only the bad dubbing lets it down a little but do n't let that put you off in any way . What lies beneath over hyped and crap . Mute witness low budget not hyped at all and very good .
4414_7.txt,1, In a lot of ways this film defines the essence of everything love about cinema in terms of capturing those strange elusive moments of unguarded truth . In other ways it is undeniably an amateurish unfocused result of junkies self fooling around with a camera . Ultimately it comes out somewhere between pure brilliance and unwatchability much more so the former than the latter Part of me wants to reward it solely for it's absolute innovativeness and moments of pure sublimity but at the same time ca n't completely ignore the occasionally downright awful acting'' and overtly bad production values . At first the editing seems overwhelmingly sloppy and needlessly distracting maybe just wrongheadedly innovative'' but after a while got used to it which is in the end the true sign of whether a film succeeds on it's own terms or not . guess that answer basically sums up my all feelings for the film . That is despite it's in flaws on a whole it does work very well . And if nothing else a film like this really shows how false and contrived the faux shaky style can sometimes be when it so obviously applied purely for effect as in films like the otherwise admirable Roger Dodger Here the aesthetics are plainly derived from the necessities of the filming situation and are not just used arbitrarily to make it look cool''
947_8.txt,1, First of all you should watch this only if you do n't mind the lack of subtitles pornography kinky sex and utter horrifying and truly shocking depravity mentioned kinky sex but to call sex in the second half of the movie kinky would be a great understatement It's more like a punch in the face if you are n't prepared for this sort of sickness That being said can go back to reviewing this morbid piece of pseudo snuff genre brought to us by our fellow Japanese The plot seems to be fairly basic almost nonexistent a girl is hired to perform in amateur porn movie Do n't expect much in first minutes There is some dialog if you do n't speak Japanese it's not going to mean much to you that seems to be an occasional chatting between the girl and the crew performer then there is some porn straight sex and after the scene is finished the performers and the crew take a break And then it starts to happen It seems that the girl is talked into performing one more scene this time tied with the rope The abuse begins whipping slapping hot wax In the end girl breaks down and cries They untie her Then we see performers and crew sitting at the table as if nothing had happened except for the girl She is visibly shaken and looks like she wants to leave She walks to the door sits on the floor to put her shoes on and that's when hell breaks loose She is hit in the head with the baseball bat her wound is treated she is tied to the bed What ensues can be briefly described I'm not going to spoil everything for you as rape during dismemberment Think of Flower of flesh and blood mix it with porn and you will get the idea goes on for about minutes or so SFX are very good makeup too Everything is shown with no mercy for the viewer You have been warned thought Visitor was a very sick movie After watching Niku daruma it looked like a fairytale to me movie is so sick so depraved so twisted so disgusting that the harshest words pale in comparison to it's finale Too bad it's released only on VHS so there are no subtitles available But the movie still works without them So if you are into ultra sickness extreme sadism and other beauties of this beloved genre check this out hope you wo n't have nightmares
1780_10.txt,1, The Dekalog may be considered a violent accusation against the death sentence according to the fifth commandment Thou shalt not kill'' not by chance it puts the concept of a State fully complied with the provisions of an unjust law on the same plane as the figure of a Murderer . But the law might not imitate the nature it might correct it states Piotr the counsel for the defense a real catalyst character the punishment is a form of vengeance aiming at returning evil for evil without preventing the crime . But in the name of whom the law takes its revenge ? Really in the name of the innocent ones ? The horrifying and detailed sequences of the last half hour of a man sentenced to death give value to the uselessness of the deterrent function applied to the death penalty with the purpose of intimidating all potential criminals . Desperate plights do n't demand desperate remedies'' Kieslowski says in his message teaching us how unrighteous can be the act of disobedience to a commandment of God that judges punishment the same way as crime is judged . There are three different moral attitudes here the innate sense of rebellion of the MURDERER aiming at rousing the hostile torpor of the surrounding environment the strong sense of chronic indifference of the VICTIM inclined to laugh at other people's requirements the deserving behavior of the COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENSE always ready to fight against adversity in favor of human life . The struggle for life is ruthlessly vivisected all of the time the characters are plunged into scenes of affliction and distress in an urban landscape accented with greenish tones and seen in its own reflections through the windshield of a taxi . Everything in Dekalog conveys a dreadful sense of estrangement and isolation descriptions of a waste undergrowth of violence and folly scenes of precarious conditions of work sinister appearances of buildings immersed in an anonymous aura of desolation aimless wanderings through disenchanting environments . Jazek the main character is compelled to struggle with an opponent stronger than himself a town completely wrapped in profound indifference apparently hostile deaf to all his mute calls for help while a faded photo of a little girl in a first communion dress goes on gnawing his soul . He's irremediably directing his steps towards a disconnected route to damnation seen through the deformations of the mm . wide angle camera lens aiming at distorting every details altering the reality making it fade out in remote and alien echoes . Kieslowski does n't bring extenuating circumstances seasoned with honey tones of melodrama in favor of the defendant differently from some Hollywood stereotypes like want to live'' Robert Wise He does n't slip on the banana peel of useless pathetic scenes to extenuate Jazek's guilt and to mitigate the brutality of the crime not interested at all in proximate psychological motivations to justify any display of extreme or violent behaviors and refusing to include any useless judicial proceedings . In other words in Kieslowsky's opinion crime is always a crime'' according to the principle of par condicio'' he puts the prosecutor on the same plane as the condemned man using many signs or symbols to represent a society seen in the most sinister light . And we ca n't remain indifferent even if we do n't agree with him Jazek's screams of anguish touch our hearts with pity in the same manner that Terri Schiavo's entreating eyes do .
9896_9.txt,1, just saw this film at the phoenix film festival today and loved it . The synopsis was listed in our program as an old Shakespearean actor invites his three children to his suicide party'' was n't sure if was going to see it because when read about it liked the idea of a suicide party'' it sounded very interesting to me but old Shakespearean actor'' had me worried that the film would be kind of dry and boring . But decided to give it a try . am glad that did . It was not dry and boring in the least that dialogue was great funny in a clever way but not pretentious and difficult to understand . Peter Falk was terrific in this role he stole the show . also was pleasantly surprised by Laura San Giacomo's performance usually she bugs me but enjoyed watching her in this film very much . think Judge Reinhold's part could have been done better by another actor at times he seemed kind of cheesy and it looked like acting not like you were just watching this character . But the movie was so good was able to forgive one actor's awkwardness . would recommend this film to anyone and have already told a few people to see it as soon as it is available to the general public . Who knew suicide could be so hilarious ?
11454_7.txt,1, The is largely considered the decade in which horror decided to have fun . Sometimes there were some definite brains behind it all Dead II'' Night of the Creeps'' and Return of the Living Dead'' for example and then there were those movies that were mindless but had a definite low rent charm and were perfect for a night with beer and friends . Movies like Pieces'' and Blood Diner'' stacked rental shelves in the and offering little in intelligence or craftsmanship but plenty in dumb entertainment . Kevin Tenney's movie Night of the Demons'' is a part of this tradition poorly acted and not an original bone in it's body but dammit if you do n't have a good time . The plot is so simplistic it just had to come from the a group of dumb teens played by a bunch of actors in their mid to late decide to go to a party at Hull House thrown by Angela Kinkade and Suzanne Queen legend Linnea Quigley . Well Angela and co. decide to throw a This turns out to be as Will Arnett's Arrested Development'' character Gob would call it a Huge Mistake because a demonic force soon possesses Angela and starts to get to the others as well . Take The Evil Dead'' Nightmare on Elm Street'' and your average dumb dead teen flick throw them in a blender and Night of the Demons'' is what you get . The movie is anything but original and really it's not a good movie . The whole thing is insanely derivative the acting is terrible the jokes often fall flat the characters are annoying the character of Stooge and the plot holes are numerous . That out of the way it's still a lot of fun . So why ? Well for one thing the make up and gore effects are top notch with some really memorable moments a nasty and just plane odd bit with a tube of lipstick that really stick out . It also rarely if ever takes itself too seriously yet with the exception of some terrible puns plays it straight and never wastes the audiences time with winking self awareness . Plus there's a definite energy and enthusiasm to the whole enterprise that's almost impossible to resist . Yeah it's nothing special but it knows that and it could n't be more proud of that fact . It's a goofy party horror movie and it never pretends to be anything more . It might not be a classic but Night of the Demons'' is a good example of horror junk food done right . It might not be too memorable or original but sometimes you do n't want a fancy beer . Sometimes you want a Budweiser .
6150_7.txt,1, Instead of watching the recycled history of Pearl Harbor'' with nothing new to reveal except for a couple of real events involving a few individuals thrown in so the makers of the film could say they contributed to the spread of history along with nothing but CGI explosions filling in for a sappy romantic triangle . One should go see Dark Blue World . This film takes place during the historic time in WWII which the Czech pilots left their homeland and went to fight for the RAF instead of laying down their arms and giving in to the Nazis . It was a part of history that should at least be told once to the outside world . love triangle takes place between the main characters but one of them does not die off conveniently like in Pearl Harbor but through sacrifice for true friendship . The movie is tragedy after tragedy with not even a bittersweet ending with our hero not enjoying glory of taking his country back the return of love by his current lover the return of love by his reunited lover or even the return of unconditional love by his life long pet . He is utterly heartbroken and feels no worse off in the Russian labor camp . This kind of ending is something that Hollywood would probably change if it was their script . The movie does play on the sentimental sometimes but it also shows the humanity of people . Overall a worthwhile movie .
4567_10.txt,1, Claudine is a movie that is representation of the american system at it's worst . The welfare system was initially set up as a stepping stone for those families who needed that extra hand to get back on their feet . movie showed an accurate portrayal of how the welfare system breaks down the family unit . In other words if the father or any male figure is in the lives of the women and children their financial support from the system would be jeopardized if not terminated . The struggles of the poor can be seen throughout the world . would like to see a reproduction of this movie back in the stores for all to rent or buy for their library collection .
10377_8.txt,1, This movie was to me a fairly enjoyable watch mean it was n't great but it was one of the better horror movies of late . It seems to have been low almost state benefit budget size but it has it's charms like the lovely ladies in it . The atmosphere was good also is what is missing froma hell of a lot of horror movies these days The acting was your typical low budget affair that being in case you do n't know is that it is dud'' acting . But that is what Lucio Fulci's movies were full of they like this movie had atmosphere what they were lacking in storyline and money etc . They more than made up for in the horror gore atmosphere for the movie it's self . It is just a typical low budget horror movie that is watchable watched it all the way and love horror movies . I've seen movies where just turn off within to minutes or sit and fast forward it if it's on video or skip scene's on the DVD . This movie did n't make me want to do that sat and watched it all the way to the end without wanting to skip parts . would have liked it however if the zombie type folk in this were a little more scarier as they were about as scary as having Freddy Kreuger as your babysitter not . But seriously though if they were a little better it would have been low budget perfection maybe . The music in this movie was top notch stuff ideal horror music so it was . I've seen horror movies where the music is good or average but it could have been better thank goodness though this movie did n't have nay of the Metal music in it . I've been a die Metal fan since but in horror movies metal music spoils it the movie looses atmosphere a lot when any type of music other than a score is playing . So i'm glad there was no music in this movie other than just your typical score which was rather creepy well done . It could have use Profane Grace Epitaph Of Shattered Dreams'' on it though . As it is keyboard music no guitars no nothing except really'' creepy keyboard tracks . Like track one Forever Sleep'' you hear the wind blowing all the way through it and some goose bump inducing keyboard music that follows it . Ever track on that cd is the same ideal horror music at it's best it would have suited this movie perfectly . The only unattractive chick in the movie to me was the one who got chibbed so we are led to believe and hung up as a scarecrow only to get free and try to escape later . Every other woman in the movie was lovely indeed a big out of for them all except the one mentioned above . wish that Hollywood side of things would give money to Romero and the guy who made this movie . As giving it to them for movies is way better a decision made than giving it to a goon muppet called Paul Anderson of the resident evil'' mince . Well done guys it is not bad not bad at all loved the part at the end credits when they kept showing you clips of them making the movie the scene's Not many movies do this kind of thing which thought added a little to the movie as it also showed you some outtakes of sorts and that's always a good thing if you ask me . Rating for this movie rating for the lovely ladies in the movie rating for the atmosphere in the movie rating for the score for the film
10091_10.txt,1, must say I'm an avid horror movie fan and currently ca n't get enough of foreign horror . Since US horror really depends too much on gore . This movie is fantastic . This movie reminded me a lot of Night's SIXTH SENSE . The way the film was directed was great . The director took his time to set everything up . It took about a good mins just to set the movie up into a horror movie . thought the movie was just a drama . This movie just builds up and the pay off is n't too much . I've never done this before but this is the main reason liked the movie . actually screamed out loud because one scene just startled the hell out of me . which is kinda pathetic . but for a film to do that it's great .
5133_10.txt,1, must confess was surprised at how good this movie was when first watched it . had planned to see it in theaters during the summer but found out unpleasantly that it had already been and gone . Therefore expected it to have been removed from theaters because it was bad . Then today rented it and watched it and really enjoyed it . The speed that events were occurring was questionable it could have been a little longer . found it was very true to the book however it left out some crucial parts Mullet Finger's real name etc . felt as if had n't read the book would n't have really understand what was going on . The acting was quite good another thing had expected to be poor however the cop sorry ca n't remember the actor's name could have done a little better . All in all found this to be a very entertaining movie and would recommend it to all audiences !
6760_7.txt,1, Cannibalism a pair of cinematic references to Delicatessen not only in plot but in style . Cannibalism a pair of references to the historic case of the Uruguayan rugby players that survived in the Andes by eating the dead members of their flight to Chile . Cannibalism only an excuse the movie uses to delve into the extremes men are willing to go to defeat isolation and obtain social acceptance . The script is extremely creative and hopefully is going to leave the viewer laughing and wondering .
11979_10.txt,1, This movie deserves the I'm giving it . But it's not the that you'd give to movies like Godfather or or This is the kind of you give to a movie which just makes you laugh and over again ! It's the most horribly written and directed movie yet it does n't fail to entertain . It has the most amateur effects yet you enjoy every moment ! saw this movie today on TV and did n't want to move away ! Read the following dialogue to know why ! college is standing around Manisha has just undergone a rape attempt and the guys who attempted the rape are asking for forgiveness Bad Guy Please forgive us ! Bad guy Yes wo n't do it again . response from Manisha Akshay Come on them ! Manisha do n't know . Akshay You are a beautiful woman and even dead men can get aroused by you ! And these are living young males ! Do n't blame them ! Pancholi Yeah Manisha . Manisha Suniel What if they tried to rape your girlfriend ? Suniel I'd break their hands and kill them . anyways forgive them . Akshay Yeah if you do n't forgive them then it will be as though you are too arrogant about your beauty ! Now that is a true masterpiece of a dialogue ! This movie never fails to entertain mainly because there are so many goofs and unrealistic situations ! The bad guy can do basically anything . can blow a sandstorm from his mouth or he can get a motorcycle from his backside and just as easily make it disappear again . Every actor takes turns to speak . line from Akshay from Suniel then from Arshad then Aftab then Nigam . It's the main rule followed by the director so that equal screen time is given to each guy . And then there's the all powerful pendant which can cause even a speeding car to go right through you without you being harmed ! All these things make it an enjoyable movie and can watch it over and over again . think this movie can go into the comedy hall of fame if there is one . The only problem is that it was n't trying to be funny .
918_10.txt,1, Valentine Dogkiller'' Dussaut and Joe The Judge'' Kern join forces to clean up the mean streets of Geneva ! Thrill as they put the kibosh on international heroin smugglers Polish fugitives peeping toms philandering girlfriends renegade dogs and litterbugs who are too lazy to bin their recyclables . Do n't be fooled by the deceptive Miramax ad campaign that paints it as a pretentious art house flick . This movie is action !
2158_10.txt,1, Yes indeed we have a winner a winner in best dumb The only reason chose to vote a for this movie is because it's so incredibly bad that it actually becomes funny . Night Hunter'' is basically about Jack Cutter a Vampire hunter hunters have been in his generation for centuries apparently and his mission being that he has to kill the last remaining Vampires . This movie contains one of the cheesiest scenes have ever seen in my life . Not to mention the really bad gun scenes . When people are shot in this movie blood splatters thick as ketchup all over the place this makes the movie seem so cheap and lame that you just lose interest . constant shaking of the camera is what annoys me the most during the fight This is suppose done to create an action though in my opinion it gives no effect whatsoever . Its completely ridiculous ! All stunt are done extremely badly . a scene where the dead Vampire gets thrown off a roof . When the corpse hits the ground it bounces like a wobbly rubber scene where Jack sniffs the ground getting a vision was so lame it got me laughing hysterically . Lame music cheesy scenes bad acting and plain dumb filming techniques are obviously the functions that make this movie such a malfunction . To state that this is a good movie would be the same as stating that nuclear bombs are good for humans . Clearly those of you who say that this is one of the best action have n't seen many in your life . This is basically a vampire that deserves but which I'll give just for its ability the lousiest action have ever seen making me laugh and because just ca n't live without it .
8990_8.txt,1, Like most sports movies it's not surprising that people who know something about the sport can find flaws in it . As a soccer referee have yet to see a movie or TV show get it right when depicting a match . Forever'' has good actors but found Sean Astin to be a bit young to be an administrator in a juvenile jail . was very thankful that the plot did not involve the lead character turning his fellow inmates into rugby players and taking on Flagstaff as well as Highland . Which gets to credulity a police squad car just happens to pull up at precisely the time the Flagstaff baddies are hazing Rick Penning . Even though rugby is not a sanctioned high school sport nationally the team is a school club sport much like rodeo . That said find it hard to believe that high school officials would allow students to play with open wounds That just is n't done in this day of AIDS and Hepatitis . do n't care what the tradition and macho image is . Despite that it was a cool movie in that teens were expected to act like adults sometimes actually did Sadly far too many coaches are like Flagstaff's or worse .
9547_8.txt,1, What could ever happen in a dull Texan town in summer ? Well a bunch of teenagers find out a few things can and do happen . It turns out the Mexican werewolf of this story is nothing less than el chupacabra and the movie unlike the name would suggest is not a remake or lookalike of the American Werewolf movies but something completely different . Overall for an obviously low movie it's not bad ! Some clever camera work quite decent looking traditional creature and gore effects and for once not all people that can and do make mistakes like shooting a colleague thinking it's the big bad beast and are baffled by things they could not possibly know . Sit down at this expecting a blockbuster million production and you will turn it off in disgust after a short while . Sit down at this expecting a bit of entertainment and a relatively simple story and it's quite good ! Overall it gets an from me for being creative having OK acting and pulling off some good work for the budget this movie had .
519_7.txt,1, Witchery'' is a decent little Euro horror yarn ! David Hasselhoff is pretty damn funny in this one and sadly he's one of the better actors . Linda Blair is downright terrible and the lady who plays Hoff's wife . is hilariously bad ! The plot of this film is ridiculous too . It's got some holes which you ca n't help but notice but it remains entertaining throughout . The gore in Witchery'' is freaking outstanding . loved the part where the old bag gets sucked'' into the trash chute and ends up in the chimney to roast ! And the part where the lady gets taken advantage of'' by the Devil was pretty damned disturbing . I'd say this one is a must for gorehounds . If you're looking for an overproduced well flick look elsewhere . But if you like old style Italian sleaze and over the top gore Witchery'' belongs on your shelf . I'm surprised by the low rating on here ! What were you people expecting The Exorcist ? out of kids .
7268_10.txt,1, I'm amazed that have a real affection for this one inasmuch as I'm not an action and adventure lover . But hey . It's pretty tough to go wrong with a Robert Carlyle film . I've read several poor or temperate reviews on this film pulling it apart for it's period errors or unlikely plot development but no one seems to mention the rather intriguing character transition which features how a hardened down scoundrel transforms into a rather noble selfless hero and how the pretty cowardly vagrant a real taste for the life of a highway man once he gets the feel of it . Filled with lots of bad humor lavish scenes the use of fireworks'' by former apothacary Plunkett and a charmingly ecclectic musical score Plunkett Macleane is a fast enjoyable piece of film making . It's certainly worth your viewing time FOR THE CLIMAX SCENE ALONE ! Shoot up boys !
2517_7.txt,1, Another decent offering from the pen of Vince Gilligan . pre in the Middle'' Bryan Cranston plays Patrick Crump a deranged guy who eventually hijacks Mulder via gunpoint and has him driving west at high speeds . It has something to do with his severe head ringing possible deadly combustion wife just experienced it and the pressure only seems to be relieved by heading towards the left coast . Only Mulder could relate to this guy's plight and actually bond with his captor before the all night ride is completed . Meanwhile Scully seems to have solved the case with a possible remedy for Mr. Crump and will meet them at the ocean . Check it out to see if our Dynamic Duo can hook up at the Pacific and somehow rectify Mr. Crump's big problem .
5959_7.txt,1, Just saw the movie it's actually pretty good . The trailers'd left me an impression of either yet another Dujardin one la de Nice or an expensive stupid French comedy . Surprisingly it's neither . Secret agent OSS is stupid but at least he sort of knows it whereas I've always found that James Bond was stupid but acted like a smart arse . Dialogue is witty with a lot of tongue humour that one would expect from a British rather than a French movie . The women and the music are beautiful . refreshing trip into the past when the bad guys were ex or Soviet brutes cars were shiny and France had colonies !
6227_8.txt,1, have to admit thanks to this movie i'm now afraid of mannequins . hahaha . but yes first off the acting in this movie at least by my standard is pretty swell . most of the actors are pretty decent in their roles . the script also seems to be pretty good too sure some cheesy stuff in there but also some decently written character and some damn scary scenes . STILL get shivers thinking about that one scene with the dude and the mannequins . brrr . yeah I'll say you should check this movie out it's pretty good and very entertaining . a good watch .
12032_7.txt,1, Hollywood has turned the Mafia in to a production line of output ranging from the banal to the excellent and despite some good acting and a reasonable script of which is for a change true ! this home entertainment'' effort has to fall slap bang in the middle . The script is not only obvious of the checklist boxes end up being ticked but spends a lot of time trying to create a pastiche of the best of other people's work . The Godfather being the most obvious but there are other references too . wo n't bother naming them . Nevertheless it is a good taste borrower ! The producer seems to set a quota for gunshots and murder at least every twenty minutes ? and the ending is weak and so what ? am told there are various versions of this production so that maybe that is just the version have seen . Gangsters do n't make money they take money . Usually by fear . Some seem more in to the murder and mayhem side of the business than making money . They were the ones that were the first to go real life and here You ca n't make money with a gun in your hand'' says Charlie Luciano at one stage . One of the smarter gangsters although all things are relative . He was a skilled white slave trader and a drug dealer before being bundled home to Italy . The old school moustached Pete's'' were picked off by the new bloods who wanted the power and the money for themselves and to break free of the straight jacket of Italian power doing business outside themselves The young Turk knew they needed to be allied with other groups notably the Jews'' who knew how to launder money and this is at least referenced and acknowledged . What is n't made so clear is that most immigrant groups had their own Mafia's but most of them made their money and went legit . And why not ? Who wants to die in jail ? Joseph Bonanno was a ruthless man prepared to kill if needs be but not an unfair or stupid one . His story was tragic in that he could have made money in the over ground world and he showed a special skill in avoiding getting killed . With a little bit of luck attached naturally . Despite the range of respectable names and three actors in the title role Ramsay Martin Landau and Tony Nardi there is n't the charisma or the talent to bring us in and feel anything . We are merely passive observers in a life we are glad not to have lead . The people shown here were born in to a cruel world but their only mark was to make it crueler . If you ca n't get enough of the gangster genre that will be better than watching Godfather for the tenth time and it is even better as basic entertainment than the horrible misfire that was Godfather
7262_8.txt,1, Well I'm not about to add to the diatribe that's been about this film . All can add is that at NO time does it even pretend to be a picture . Unlike or Patriot all of which have very credible and serious historical amendments purely for theatric effect the worst of excuses Has everyone taken a sense of humor bypass ? All can add is a paraphrase from the good Captain Macleane looked fantastic and we have a bloody good laugh One last point . What astonishes me is that there are comments relating to the music in a historic setting . wonder if the same people made the same judgment about Moulin Rouge . suggest not .
8341_10.txt,1, Way too many Christian films become centered around the fear of the Judgment and as a result come across as condescending and indeliberately cheesy . Second Glance'' gets it right . This is a near perfect evangelical tool it deals with the real reason why so many young people want nothing to do with Christianity . It assures viewers that one must give up their sin their fun succeed in the Christian lifestyle . Second Glance'' even works as a piece of film The filmmakers obviously were working on a very low budget but they managed to write a script dynamic enough to divert viewers attention from this obvious fact . This film brought me to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and thanks to Christian stations everywhere which show it it surely has impacted more people than just me .
2585_8.txt,1, Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening guess you would call it in Atlanta GA at Atlantic Station . Walking in was expecting something controversial provocative unnecessarily overdone etc . But the film is much more than that . It's a story of two people helping each other . It's not overdone and the film is done in a careful balance as to not make you cringe or say its unnecessary . It's put together really well and does n't take itself too seriously . Thats the beauty of it . If it tried to take itself seriously it would have failed miserably but instead it carries itself through humor unintentional and some surprisingly good acting by Ricci . Although Timberlake fails miserably in his role the movie is good enough for you to put that on the side . would definitely recommend this movie if not for any other reason than the fact it is something different to experience .
8629_7.txt,1, So guess that Bud and Lou just liked to mess with classic stories they did have some interesting results In this case they're baby a bad boy and Lou tries to read him Jack and the Beanstalk'' but falls asleep and dreams that he's Jack and Bud's the butcher and they climb the beanstalk to rescue the prince and princess from the giant Baer think that my favorite scene was when Lou was trying to make the giant an omelet and . I'll let you see what happens . As this was an Abbott and Costello movie they did have a few unnecessary songs but other than that it was pretty funny . For other interpretations of the classic story Bewitched'' and Gilligan's Island'' both had episodes portraying it .
9104_7.txt,1, mild spoilers a basic plot outline no real details IF you go into this movie with sufficiently low expectations . saw this film at a free screening a few days ago in Maryland and the only reason agreed to go . because it was free . expected a few chuckles but as have never been a huge fan of Tenacious not much more then that . The first ten minutes of the film are hilarious as we are given a look at Jack Black's humble Christian origins in a Midwest American town . The film then takes us years into the future to the first meeting between JB and Kyle Gass the second half of Tenacious We see the formation of the band and the genesis of its name . Finally as the title suggests the second half of the film details their quest to obtain the fabled Pick of Destiny . Again the beginning of the film was laugh out loud funny and most of the movie at least kept a smile on my face . That said there were times it felt a bit long it's only minutes but it still felt like it should have been a bit shorter . The story is every bit as absurd as it sounds and this is not a film you see if you want a real plot . Which is fine except it means that many of the jokes are very hit or miss . when they miss they miss bad . Same thing with the songs it is a musical but many of the songs lost their appeal after the first minute or so . kept going anyway . will say that the really saved this movie from bombing The D's humor simply could n't work without cussing sex and drug references . But unless you're a real fan of the band or at the very least know you appreciate their style of comedy would recommend you save yourself some money and rent . Pick'' will make you giggle a bit . is it worth bucks ? do n't think so . was tempted to rate it a but since do think that many would enjoy it enough to justify seeing it in theatres a seems more appropriate . Just be sure it's your style .
8771_7.txt,1, This is the second Hitchcock film to appear on the list and the second Hitchcock film I've seen in full the first was Rope which really enjoyed . With Saboteur Hitchcock was more room to roam free whereas Rope took place all in one room . did n't enjoy this one as much as Rope but that's not saying this is a bad film it just seems like an average flick that could have been something more . It seems like a film Hitchcock would make as a break in between his more serious ones . As a thriller feel it fails to really get my on the edge of my seat or engaged with the lead character who is running around the States . The climax of the film feels like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension . The sound design is almost non existent . You can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them but the important things are missing the stitches ripping apart from the sleeve the need of music to amp of the tension all missing . Intentional no doubt yet it lacks the emotional punch one would want from such a scene . Then it ends abruptly leaving you empty inside . The film does n't feel like it should either they are almost globe trotting from place to place yet it feels more confined . The script itself is very average and seems to go about the more obtuse ways to get the plot moving . The performances are there but nothing amazing . Everyone plays their parts to scripted words on the page . The relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work . The one stand out is Otto Kruger who has that rich ego evil persona down pat . In the end wanted more from this one . understand it's one of Hitchcock's least exciting films but did have a good time watching it . can recommend it just not enthusiastically .
12434_8.txt,1, Gaming ? Nicotine ? Fisticuffs ? We're moving in a descending spiral of iniquity ! So says the head of St. Swithen's upon inspecting the master's common at Nutbourne . The faculty and students of St. Swithen's have been ordered to share facilities at Nutbourne to avoid German bombs during World War II . Then there's the masters library . The Diary of Samuel Pepys ? Abridged . that's something to be thankful for . What's up here ? The Memoirs of Casanova ? Was n't that the book we caught Jessica James reading in the closet ? Decameron Nights ! Well really ! What ever else this place may or may not be it's no place to bring carefully nurtured girls ! Yes a terrible mistake has been made by the Ministry of Education . Nutbourne is a school for boys . St. Swithen's is a school for girls . And what makes this one of the best post British comedies Nutbourne's head master is Wetherby Pond . by Alastair Sim while St. Swithen's head mistress is Muriel Whitchurch . by Margaret Rutherford . St. Swithen's ? says Pond . You do n't mean to say that yours is a school for boys and girls ? he asks one of the early girls . Only girls'' she says cheerfully . Does this mean sir asks one of Nutbourne's teachers that we are to expect young girls ? It means that not only have the ministry made a mistake in sending a school here at all but that it is guilty of an appalling sexual aberration ! Margaret Rutherford's Miss Whitchurch as positive and immovable as a battleship intends to make the best of it by briskly taking over Nutbourne if possible . Alastair Sim's Pond is exasperated up to his big bald head and is determined to salvage his school . In the meantime there are young girls and young boys to be fed and places found for them to sleep with all their teachers The cooks and caretakers totally put upon walk out . Miss Whitchurch and her girls however are up to the cooking tasks . Come now Angela she says to one girl who is trying to stir something in a big pot have n't you made porridge before ? Yes but no one ever had to eat it . That's a defeatist attitude my dear . Stir it well and do n't shilly shally . Things are hardly going well when Pond discovers four governors from a school he hopes to lead are arriving at any moment to see for themselves how well led Nutbourne is . And Miss Whitchurch learns that four wealthy and influential parents have just arrived to see how their daughters are doing in the new boy free they were told facilities . The only solution ? Miss Whitchurch and Pond their teachers and their students concoct a split shifting of classes to give the allusion that Nutbourne has no girls and that St. Swithen's has no boys . After the parents inspect a dorm and leave for a class the girls in the beds duck under and the boys who'd been hidden under leap up into the beds just as the governors walk in . The boys are observed at rugby and as soon as the governors turn their backs the goal posts are taken down nets for lacrosse are put up and just then the parents walk over to observes the girls . One parent spots her daughter in a science class then moments later sees her in a choir practice then moments later . There's Angela again she says to Miss Whitchurch . Why so it is she replies hustling the parents out to avoid the governors who are approaching just around the corner . The child's quite ubiquitous . When we leave Nutbourne everything has been discovered . The students are milling about . The teachers are dazed for two who are kissing . The Education Ministry has just sent several more busloads of students . The parents are speechless but the governors are not . We're waiting for an explanation one says sharply . Pond holds his head and shudders . Ca n't you see I'm trying to think of one . The film moves from one complicated and ridiculous situation after another braced by a very funny script and two hugely comedic performances by Rutherford and Sim . Sim's droll exasperation and Rutherford's implacable determination are so well matched that's it's a shame this is the only movie they ever made together . Joyce Grenfell as Gossage St. Swithen's tall awkward loping sports teacher gives them some competition . If you keep your eyes open you'll also find some amusing references director Frank Launder works in including a gong at Nutbourne that looks just like a midget version of Arthur Rank's a faint echo of the zither theme from The Third Man and a shot stolen from David Lean's Oliver Twist except this time the little boy walks up holding his porridge bowl and says Please sir . do n't want anymore . Frank Launder and his partner Sidney Gilliat were responsible for some of the best films produced in Britain during the Thirties Forties and Fifties . They wrote produced and directed sometimes doing one sometimes the other . In one way or another they were responsible for such first films as Green for Danger a masterly droll performance by Sim See a Dark Stranger The Lady Vanishes Night Train to Munich Wee Geordie The Belles of St. Trinian's The Rake's Progress and many others . With The Happiest Days of Your Life Launder wrote and directed while both produced . It's one of their best .

With the children asleep and a beautiful home to relax in she locks the door and sets the alarm . But when a series of eerie phone calls from a stranger says that she check the children Jill panics . Fear to terror when she has the calls traced . And what the police find turns the perfect babysitting job into a worst nightmare . There are n't any other lead actors in this movie . Camilla Belle is the main star with a cute face . The day she arrives to babysit she really has no idea what in the hell really awaits her . If were in a house like the one Jill was in . would explore everything that is around . The fridge would be the first person would looks at but I'm a male and do n't babysit . But what found funny was the size of the house . was thinking would the movie be the same if the house were n't so big ? Anyone could get lost in that huge house but this movie needed a house with a massive size . Camilla Belle has a cute face a perfect smile but it's like for a movie like this the lead actress needs someone with experience . found Camilla not that good . do n't know maybe she thought that this could be her breakthrough role . do like her she is a cute girl but someone to have a role in this movie has to be someone how is different to take it . This movie was n't scary . also found this movie more like a chick flick'' think the only reason this was released during the SuperBowl Weekend was that the guys stay home and watch the game and the girls go out to go see this . It also seems like a type of a movie when girls will enjoy more than guys . But did like this movie but for how it is . Girls just like tog et scared or scream . This was just a pretty decent movie . Maybe anyone could like this movie . There are many PG horror films that never succeed . This was on its own level . So kinda liked this movie . give it a
348_7.txt,1, What exactly do people expect when they watch an Al Adamson film ? Are they expecting classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories ? You'd think so by some of the reviews . Al Adamson's films are trashy and sleazy and cheesy not much more so if you go into them knowing that already it helps and they are n't necessarily to be taken at face value especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value . First off this starts by ripping off the end theme music from Outer Limits so you know things are looking promising . This is the story of some wacko cult that lives in the hills and while trying to raise a dead body the leader suffers a heart attack and ends up in the hospital . Of course Nurse Sherri tends to his needs and all and when an operation is needed she just happens to be hanging out in the operating room when the guy passes on so his spirit invades her . And Nurse Sherri begins to change . No longer the nice nurse she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects . There's a couple little side stories going on like folks trying to burn the body of the dead cult leader and a blinded football star that has become the love object of one of Sherri's co who also just happens to dabble in voodoo . This is not bad if you're a cult film fan but it may be bad if you're a Spiderman'' fan because you wo n't like it . At times this actually lurches towards respectability'' Adamson anyway but then it unredeems itself with some ridiculous event . If you enjoy Adamson's films and similar trash you may well like this for anyone else who may be looking for a lost treasure keep digging . out of
6941_8.txt,1, As a Canadian did n't know very much about the Whitlam dismissal . had read the Wikipedia page about those events but that was about it . Earlier this year when Canada went through a potential constitutional crisis fizzled out thankfully that might have led to intervention by our Governor the Whitlam dismissal was mentioned in the press . In an effort to learn more ordered the DVD of this mini through EBay . was greatly impressed by how interesting the account was . As dramatic as events were this could have been a very boring political drama . However it was a pretty suspenseful mini was also impressed by how understandable it was despite my lack of familiarity with Australian politics . It did n't take long to figure out who everyone was and what their roles were . Having said that it is not an entirely impartial account . Malcolm Fraser is certainly portrayed as a rather Machiavellian figure who lets no person or thing get in the way of his quest to be Prime Minister . Gough Whitlam is portrayed in a more noble almost saintly light . However the actor portraying Whitlam channels the nobility in such a way that it comes across more as pomposity . thought that Sir John Kerr was portrayed in a fairly sympathetic manner . must warn people that the DVD is of very poor quality . understand that it was made for television in the early but it would appear that no effort was made to restore the picture quality or sound quality . It was very disappointing that no extras were added either . documentary or even some interviews with the historical figures would have enhanced the experience but there is nothing . highly recommend this mini for anyone interested in the real events .
1389_7.txt,1, This movie is based on the novel Island of dr. Moreau By Wells . It's a fairly good one too it's at least better than the version by John Frankenheimer .
11406_8.txt,1, People say that this film is a teen horror movie well it's a horror movie with a teenage girl in it . what do you expect ! It's a good film counted actual screams in the audience whilst the film was on and it was a very jumpy scary film . was n't bored in the film at any point and was even on the edge of my seat at one point . The only thing that was slightly bad was that it was a tiny bit slow in getting into the actual storyline but this all led up to why she was where she was and why what happened happened . The acting was good the scenery was good and the storyline was good too hope to see a Stranger Calls in a few months ! Good film !
4877_9.txt,1, saw SEA OF DUST as part of a NYC screening audience several years ago . enjoyed the film at that time so was a little confused by some of the amendments that had been made since . Perhaps it's my memory but there seemed to be chunks of exposition missing from the version that was shown at the Rhode Island Film Festival . I'm really not sure which version prefer but can honestly say that found something to appreciate it both . Let me begin by warning everyone that this is not a popcorn movie . Although it's been promoted as a Hammer Films tribute people expecting a showdown between Van Helsing and Dracula are going to be sorely disappointed . There's some cleavage but no nudity staple of the British production house's later movies And while SEA OF DUST is filled with gorgeous eye candy really is shot like a sixties film and features Hammer starlet Ingrid Pitt it's not like any of the company's pictures in tone or execution . This film is very dark very confusing and times very funny . do n't remember the earlier version being quite as nutty as this one but that's not a bad thing the showdown in the Black Forest that plays like a Three Stooges short And some of Ms Pitt's rantings are quite entertaining . It's like somebody wound her up and turned her loose . The uniqueness of this film does n't lie with the borrowed details though . It's in the ideas . As an occasional Sci Fi Channel viewer I've regularly taken the network to task for its one variations on a theme monster kills then gets destroyed SEA OF DUST is so full of ideas that you start to trip over them after a while . But do n't get me wrong . I'm not complaining . If anything applaud these guys for making such an enterprising low picture and for having the courage to pack it with so many concepts . It's not going to be a picnic for people who hate to think at the movies know who you are But for the rest of us those of us who are tired of the formula of modern horror films the predictability the lack of respect for the audience this may just be your ticket .
6813_10.txt,1, What a show ! Lorenzo Lamas once again proves his talent as a cop who committed the worst crime a good cop can commit by being a good cop . Then again he shows how sensitive a cop can be displaying a range of emotions like no other actor can except maybe himself in Terminal justice . HUGE ENJOYMENT !
11771_7.txt,1, The first half hour of Homegrown'' was rather boring and not absorbing but as the film progressed so did my interest in the characters and the plot . Several scenes are really scary and you fear for the main characters who you actually grow attached to . The story is about three hired hands on a hidden illegal marijuana farm in southern California . They witness the murder of the farm's owner Malcolm Lithgow and they take over the weed for their own . The three rather simple farm hands soon get swept up into a scary world of mafia and local interest while all of the time trying to convince everyone that Malcolm is still alive . While the movie had several faults and a slow beginning it turned out to be worthwhile . stars .
8360_7.txt,1, Being a fan of time travel stories was surprised that there was no that sent Russell Johnson's character through time . He just appeared in It was a disappointing part of the episode . enjoyed the premise of the dangers of the future by changing the past . Other Twilight Zone episodes about time travel such as No Time Like The Past'' Once Upon Time'' etc . were more to my liking because of the uses of time travel Perhaps if Russell Johnson's character had been the same character he played in Execution'' it would have been more acceptable to fans like myself . As sci fans know no characters really ever have to in time travel episodes . All sorts of plot can be applied in these types of stories . That was the only flaw could comment on for this episode .
4335_9.txt,1, This is an incredibly fun action rocker . Charles Bronson rules as Paul Kirsey . The villains are hilariously bad . The soundtrack by Jimmy Page is laughably bad . Alex Winter of Bill Ted is great as one of the street punks who gets wasted by Bronson and crew . Crew ? Oh those are the downtrodden townsfolk who team up with Bronson to win back the streets . The whole movie is enjoyable with the last half hour or so exploding into non action and mayhem .
9822_7.txt,1, I've read approximately reviews of this film but have n't taken any of them to heart'' Harrison Ford is being criticized for everything from his haircut to his earring and really do n't see what any of these things have to do with the film . As recall he had bad hair plus bad reviews in Blade Runner but it's still a favorite among us videophiles . It is slower than the majority of his previous films but not worthy of the trashings it has received . would gladly pay just to watch a bald Harrison Ford mow his lawn .
1579_7.txt,1, GUTS OF BEAUTY is a bit better than its predecessor GUTS OF VIRGIN . Although this film is n't really a sequel in the sense that it has absolutely nothing to do with the first installment did find BEAUTY to be a little stronger and better put together all than VIRGIN . then again that's not really saying much . BEAUTY starts off as a pretty rough and straight exploit film . couple of Yakuza cats are holding a young woman prisoner and begin gang raping her in pretty brutal fashion . As this nastiness is going on the head guy tells the girl that they did the same to her sister and sold her into slavery in Africa and that they're gon na do the same to her . They then shoot her up with some drugs and rape her some more . She somehow gets away and ends up at a clinic where the nurse there listens to her sob story . The rapee ends up freaking out from the stress of her prior experience and commits suicide . The clinic worker moved by the young lady's story decides to take revenge on the gang by seducing one of the lower guys and trying to hypnotize him to make him kill the Yakuza leaders . This whole plan backfires so now Ms. Vigilante gets exposed to much the same treatment that our original rapee got only worse pretty rough butt ensues along with the pre gang rape . She too is drugged but the drug has a strange side effect on our seemingly hapless victim it turns her into a raging hermaphroditic BLOOD DEMON ! sh ! that's what really happens ! This is when BEAUTY really takes off with some pretty insane kill scenes including a very classy chest that looks like a cross between ALIEN and a bad porn and my favorite a head kill with demon vagina has to be seen to be believed . Definitely some promising stuff going on in GUTS OF BEAUTY but still very disjointed feeling . BEAUTY almost feels like two different films being forced together in a non way . Still have to give the film credit the rape scenes are very rough and misogynistic and the kill scenes are just totally off the wall . solid for another crazy classic''
822_10.txt,1, This movie was made on a relatively small budget million dollars ? with almost no promotion at all from its distributors . only knew about it because am a long time Jean Van Damme fan and always check out his latest films in hope that they will be at least watchable and aside from some real turkeys Second In Command they are . This movie has an easy enough plot to follow and Van Damme gives a good humorous performance through out but the movie owes all of its credit to the fight scenes involving Van Damme Scott Adkins and the final one of them together . The editing and camera work for most of the film is pretty terrible but Isaac Florentine can definitely film a good fight scene . too am happy that Van Damme has been acting better lately Hell Wake of Death Until Death but with the good acting came less martial arts . In The Shepherd Van Damme proves that he still has it .
7395_7.txt,1, Jack Frost is probably the most cheesiest movie have ever seen in my life . The complete title of the film is Jack Frost Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman . Horror movie fans that have a taste for campy story lines will be delighted to watch this . This film was straight to video and for good reasons . Here's why The acting was so atrocious and so terrible that it could cause one to cry . The main character had no personality and the actor's bad acting made it all worse . The screenplay was was also atrocious . Each character always says a cheesy line and add the cheesy lines to the bad choreography then you have something bad . Second the story line is n't really all that impressive but since this movie was straight to video it is forgiven . The director and writer could have turned the idea of a killer snowman into something cool but they did n't . They story has lots of plot holes in it . In the beginning a cup of coffee gets knocked into the fish tank with the melted Jack Frost . Scientists try to restore his life but they could n't . Once the cup of coffee fell into the tank Jack Frost was completely restored . Now he is immune to anti In Jack Frost part the main character's DNA got mixed up with the Anti that was used to kill Jack Frost . Since the main character is allergic to bananas Jack Frost is too . Hence here's my point . They say that Sam's DNA combined with Jack Frost's . But one of the scientists had some saliva on the cup so when it fell into the tank the scientists DNA would have been combined with Jack Frosts . Another thing the special effects were n't very good either . Here's the good points Jack Frost has lots of blood that looks pretty realistic . Even though this movie is flawed to hell it is still entertaining . Overall Jack Frost is an enjoyable horror movie . The first one was better though . out of
9912_10.txt,1, Of all the episodes of all series this one holds the closest to Roddenberry's original tenet . According to the book THE MAKING OF STAR TREK in Roddenberry's writer's guide to his story writers he states that any alien creature no matter how hideously ugly impossible to believe benign or malicious MUST hold some semblance of humanity that the TV viewing public can empathize with and relate to . Devil In The Dark's HORTA which resembles nothing more or less than a large blob of cow dung is a mother protecting her babies those ball silicon nodules the miners keep finding throughout the mine passages and destroying because they have no idea what they are ! This is one of my absolute favorite episodes if only for that !
1577_8.txt,1, If they gave out awards for the most depraved and messed movies in the world Japanese cinema would clean up their exploitation cinema wipes the floor with most other contenders the most extreme examples being absolutely jaw exercises in bad taste nauseating gore freakish weirdness and misogynistic sex . Guts of a Beauty is a prime example of such whacked out filth offering discerning viewers just over an hour of full debauchery and gratuitous violence topped off with some very insane goodness . The film opens with a young woman named Yoshimi whose search for her missing sister has led her into the hands of some nasty yakuza who proceed to rape her and shoot her full of strong dope called Angel Rain . After the gangsters have finished having their fun with the poor woman she manages to escape and flees to a nearby hospital where sexy psychologist Hiromi Ozawa attempts to help . However the distraught and confused Yoshimi ends up throwing herself off the hospital roof turning into a water melon as she hits the ground least that what it looked like to me ! Seeking to avenge Yoshimi's death Hiromi lures Higashi a member of the yakuza to her office and whilst jacking him off hypnotises him into attacking his fellow gang members . After Higashi goes slash happy with a knife in the yakuza HQ he is severely beaten and stabbed forced to tell of his meeting with Hiromi and then hacked into itty bitty pieces . The psychologist is then captured by the gang subjected to a spot of forced buggery simultaneously being forced to give head to a yakuza slut and injected with Angel Rain which she promptly carks it . The gangsters then plonk her body in the boot of their car along with the remains of Higashi ready for disposal . Before they can ditch the corpses however the super dope has an unexpected effect on Hiromi she returns from the dead as a hermaphroditic monster with a toothy penis and a ravenous gash and hellbent on revenge sets about killing the yakuza one this leads to some memorable scenes of outrageously gory splatter including a messy head squish a man being suffocated by the monster's oozing vagina and a woman being screwed to death by its giant gnashing phallus . As you can most likely tell from the above synopsis this is some crazy screwed up stuff and probably not to the taste of most sane people but for those weirdos who have long tired of mainstream cinema and are already well versed in Asian excess Guts Of Beauty should prove to be delightfully diverting and deviant fun . out of rounded up to for IMDb .
6572_9.txt,1, Anand is one of those low but well taken movies . It's a cup of coffee'' entertainment with no violence blood or jump out of your seat'' excitement which most telugu films have . However it does have some massala of it's own . Roopa is a headstrong and down young woman who is not afraid to confront any sort of situation even her offensive mother distaste for her . She even backs out of the wedding because her fianc does n't stand up for her . However her air of confidence and independence is enough to make Anand a rich young gentleman living in the city aspire to be her new husband . His father accidentally kills her parents in a car crash anyways so why not pay her back ? But Roopa is not the kind who will fall for charming smiles and polite behavior she puts him through a bunch of situations continuing to be rude and a pain . It's not until he stands up for her and saves her life that she understands she loves him too . But complications ensue
7403_10.txt,1, Okay I'll say it . This movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt . This statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film . But the thing that most people do n't get is that this movie was intended to be bad and cheezy . mean did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece ? Just look at the scary'' hologram on the jacket of the movie and you'll find your answer . Instead like the original Jack Frost thought was just as funny this movie turned out to be a side journey into the depths of corny dialogue bad one liners and horrible special effects . And it's all made to deliver laughter to us viewers . It certainly worked for me . For example Anne Tiler her troubled husband What makes you frown so heavily darling ? If that chunk of dialogue does n't make you laugh then you have serious issues . Who in their right mind would utter those words in real life ? Of course no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous ! Just take one viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations and hopefully you'll see what's so damn funny about Jack Frost
11526_8.txt,1, loved it . had just sat through half of The Glass House'' it off . what a morass of predictable plot and bad acting and then saw this movie . thought it was terrific . Loved both Cameron Diaz and Jordana Brewster in it . liked the escapism of the whole setting the traveling around Europe in the thing yet they made it more realistic by showing the dark side and all of the bad things that could happen . It held my attention completely even if did think that parts were unbelievable .
3351_4.txt,0, When you look at the cover and read stuff about it an entirely different type of movie comes to mind than what you get here . Then again maybe read the summary for the other movie called Mausolem'' instead as there were two movies of this title released about the same time with both featuring plots that had key elements in common . However reading stuff about that movie here know saw this one and not that one and that movie is even less what one would imagine a movie with that title would be about . will be honest expect more of a zombie type picture and you get that in this movie to some degree . However there is more stuff involving the occult and strange powers as the opening scene of the people being taken away by the coroner at the beginning of the film will attest to . The movie also has the old theme of kids going somewhere they do not belong to have some crazy party in this case it is in fact a mausoleum . The other movie do not think really has that key feature playing that prominent role in the movie and see the score for this one is higher too still it was just not the movie was expecting .
4290_4.txt,0, Respected western auteur Budd Boetticher is woefully out of place with this choppy modern day cops and robbers story that suffers from a strong lack of emotional believability . Boetticher seems to have waived rehearsal time and settled for the first take as leads Joe Cotton and Rhonda Fleming put little effort into their roles delivering lines flatly and without energy . Mild mannered employee Leon Foggy'' Poole works as an inside man on a bank job that goes bad and gets his wife killed in the process . He escapes from prison and immediately sets out to kill the wife of the detective who killed his . Hundreds of cops are mobilized to keep him from getting to the home of the intended who has been moved to another location but would n't you know in the films final moments we have Foggy trailing feet behind the victim thought somehow that taking a bus back to the house was a sound move while a company of cops observe and bicker over what action to take . Sound preposterous ? You should see it . It's all of that and more . Lucien Ballard's camera work does a decent job of bringing noir to the suburbs but the editing is lackadaisical and shapeless and it drains the film of its suspense and pace . As Poole Wendell Corey is the best thing in the film managing to evoke great sympathy as he transitions from gentle soul to murderer . These attributes aside Killer uniformly fails in construction and execution making its message clear . Go Western old Budd .
11890_1.txt,0, was forced to watch this film for my World Reigonal Geography class . This film is what is wrong with America today instead of figuring out the best way out of hard times or situations we would rather complain about how it is someone else's fault . This film goes through the downfall of Flint Michigan and blames it on General Motors . In the process of doing so Moore goes to great lengths to make the executives of General Motors out to be villains just because they are doing their job in a capitalist society . Moore films several evictions throughout the film and does not ever even ask once if the person is being evicted because of a GM layoff . Additionally he never interviews the landlords of the tenants filmed . Moore goes to great lengths to twist historical events to fit his political agenda in this film of pure propaganda .

This time he plays a guy who help people in the witness protection program . to quote the cover of the movie . He erases their past to save their future . Woppi this have to be cool bet younger people will like it though but it is a little over the top for my taste . And the one liners are really something else and do n't mean that in a good way . After killing a crocodile he manage to say . you're luggage'' If you are in the right mood you may enjoy the movie . And as far as braindead action go this is not very bad . But almost before the movie starts you know exactly what is going to happen . But if you like these kind of movies you will probably enjoy this one . rate this movie
858_4.txt,0, The Duke'' is a film based in the heart of the British aristocracy where an old Duke Neville dies and to avoid his large property and the vast riches to be taken from him after death by devious aristocrats Muirhead and Sophie Heyman he passes his Dukeship down to his dog . The dog's best friend'' an American girl named Charlotte by Courtnee Draper whose parents die becomes orphaned by the former Duke due to him being her great uncle . young chef named Florian arrives with him and Charlotte instantly connecting creating a romantic sub which in its own way acts as the under tone for the main plot line being the activities of Hubert The and his many activities and love interests with other dogs . All this is watched over by James Doohan who plays a Butler who is determined to try and serve his old Duke by doing his best to serve his new master Hubert . Doohan acts as the older character there to comfort and advise the younger ones whilst he over looks and performs various ridiculous tasks under his new master . fine comedic performance mixed with elements of drama to end the career of a fine and influential actor . Though from the technical viewpoint dislike this film as only watched upon discovering James Doohan's role . Though the plot is good elements of the writing and directing have to be obscured . Ignoring the absurdity of a Doggie Duke'' personally dislike the over use of comedic and outrageous jokes upon the characters due to their ludicrousness . The dependence on hygiene related humour as you like is much too apparent and general silliness of many characters does n't appeal to me . The director Phillip Spink uses mid shots too often with either an overdubbed voice or affecting the overall sound quality . Plus the acting of Muirhead and Heyman whilst good at the dramatic and romantic sequences fall drastically short fulfilling the wholesale requirements regarding the role . But as a mature movie fan find it easy to be over critical of a simple family film designed to make you laugh . can admit found certain bits funny and other bits touching along with a plot that may be far but has definite connections . do not recommend this film to mature movie fans but do highly recommend it to Dog lovers families who wish to enjoy a funny film for their child and James Doohan fans who wish to see in his final role .

The Bunyip was TERRIFYING ! Nightmare inducing terrifying . With the creepy music and the little girl and kangaroo running away for their lives . As a kid also remember the animated Hobbit . no worries . Watership down ? Did n't blink an eye . Dot and the Kangaroo ? It still haunts my dreams . And have several friends the same age who also think it was massively creepy . Maybe we can get a group rate on therapy . In short one freaky film for its time .
12044_4.txt,0, It's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera and busy scratchy background score that accompanies this release . Although sound came into general use in there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman unhappily married who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods . The most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife's lover . In a frenzy of jealousy he drives at top speed toward a railroad crossing but changes his mind at the last moment losing his nerve . It's probably the most tension scene in the otherwise decidedly slow and obviously contrived story . HEDY LAMARR is given the sort of close treatment lavished on Marlene Dietrich by her discoverer but her beauty had not yet been refined by the cosmeticians as they were when she was transported to Hollywood . Her performance consists mostly of looking sad and morose while mourning the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love MOG the handsome young stud who retrieves her clothes after a nude swim . The swimming scene is very brief discreetly photographed and not worth all the heat it apparently generated . The love scene later on is also artfully photographed with the sort of lyrical photography evident throughout most of the film so . More is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism this is the sort of thing that has others proclaiming the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece . Not so . It's disappointing primitively crude in its sound portions the laborious symphonic music in the background and certainly Miss Lamarr is fortunate that Louis Mayer saw the film and on the basis of it gave her a career in Hollywood . He must have seen something in her work that did n't . It's apparent that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work . The jarring workers'' scene at the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring intrusion where none is needed . It fails to end the film on the proper note .
6492_4.txt,0, Robert Lansing plays a scientist experimenting with passing objects through solid matter but he goes too far one night and unintentionally makes himself four Atomic fantasy is rather charming in a very cheesy way . Perhaps it was considered a thoughtful sci in its time psychological overtones yet seen today the film is mildly overbaked and naive it's a camp tailor for TV's late show . Wooden performances by Lansing and Lee Meriwether barely rate as one though Patty Duke a cute brat pre Worker'' gets a colorful memorable exit . from

7736_1.txt,0, The message of Hero is quite clear the idea of Greater China is more important than the death and the suffering of millions . At a time when China is dangling its war toys over Taiwan it is unacceptable for Western viewers to endorse this piece of over government dogmatic trash . Particularly surprising is the promotion of this film by the liberal media . Roger Ebert of Chicago Tribune David Edelstein of Slate Charles Taylor of Salon and many others have wholeheartedly endorsed Hero . In so doing they have implicitly legitimated its reactionary political message . The only critic know of who saw through the film's glossy facade was Hoberman of The Village Voice who wrote of the film's sanctimonious traditionalism'' and its glorification of ruthless leadership and self on the altar of national greatness . for one sign my name under Hoberman's final pronouncement Hero is nothing more than fascinating fascism .
9257_4.txt,0, This film was released in the UK under the name Blood Rites . It was banned outright and never submitted again for release . As The Ghastly Ones it was supposedly a hit with the horror hungry denizens of New York City's famed Street Grindhouse circuit . If you are looking for some bloody horror then you will find it in this film . Unfortunately to see the developmentally disabled Colin Borske chomp down on a live rabbit you have to put up with shaky camera work that makes Ed Wood look positively marvelous . Three sisters are to spend three days in the family homestead with their husbands before the old man's money is disbursed . Naturally in such a situation people start dropping dead . Family secrets are exposed and lots of blood is spilled especially during a gruesome dismemberment . Maybe it was the bunny bit that the Brits objected to know did .

693_4.txt,0, Wrestlemania is the only Wrestlemania god to be held at three different locations and While it was an interesting idea it did n't really work . There are only really two matches that really struck out with the rest being decent or most of them pretty terrible . There are some entertaining celebrity's on hand like Susan Saint James Ray Charles and Cathy Crosby but the experience was a waste of time for the most part . The British Bulldgos Vs The Dream Team match is worth the price of admission itself but you can honestly see that anywhere . Matches . Nassau Coliseum . Paul Orndorff Vs The Magnificent Muraco Mr. For the time it had and despite the crappy finish this was surprisingly bearable stuff with the crowd being really into it . Crowd chants Bullsh at the end . That being said it did nothing for either's career . Match ends in a double count out with them fighting outside the ring Intercontinental Championship Match . Randy Savage Vs George The Animal'' Steele . Not that great wrestling wise but heavily entertaining due to the antics involved and some great comedy from Steele besides savage can wrestle a potato and make it look interesting . Savage wins when he puts his feet on the ropes for leverage . Jake The Snake'' Roberts Vs George Wells . For a throwaway match this was better than it should have been but it's too short to make any impact what so ever . Roberts wins with the DDT pulling out the snake afterwords which disgusts Saint James . Boxing Match . Mr . The Hati Kid Frazier Vs Roddy Piper Lou Duva Orton . huge failure in my opinion . was bored senseless throughout this and while it may have been a marketing success it certainly did n't succeed at entertaining me . Lot of Rowdy chants are noticeable as well . wins by DQ when Piper slams Rosemont Horizon Women's Title match . Fabulous Moolah Vs Velvet Mcintyre . Ends too quickly before it even gets a chance to start making a record for quick pin fall as far as Woman's matches are concerned . Moolah wins when she takes advantage of Velvet's missed splash from the top rope Corporal Kirchner Vs Nikolai Volkoff Classy Freddie Blassie . Big pop for the Corporal . Stupid match up with boring offense from both involved while being much too short to matter . Corporal wins when he whacks Volkoff with Blassie's cane . Battle Royal . William Perry and Andre get the biggest pops . This is pretty entertaining stuff despite all the NFL talent involved . It's also noteworthy for Bret Hart's ever Wrestlemania appearance . Andre wins when he chucks The Hart Foundation out . Tag Team Titles . British Bulldogs Lou Albano Osbourne Vs The Dream Team Johnny Valiant Absolutely tremendous match that is one of the best wrestlemania matches of all time . You wo n't have time to catch your breath with all the maneuvers on hand and the excellent in ring psychology . This is pure wrestling at it's finest you can not call yourself a Wrestling fan if you dislike this match . Bulldogs win when Dynamite Kid collide's heads with Valentine Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena Ricky Steamboat Vs Hercules Hernandez . Pretty decent match up here with both men putting on solid performances . Hercules is a nasty brute with above average skills and it contrasted well with Steamboat's high style . Steamboat wins with a high cross body off the top rope . Adrian Adonis Vs Uncle Elmer . Terrible match with annoying comedy involved . The fans love Uncle Elmer but do not . Adonis wins with a top rope maneuver . The Funk Brothers Vs Tito Santana Pretty solid match here with a lot of memorable bumps taken from Terry Funk one through the table was something else for that time would have to rate this as my favorite . Funks win with help from Jimmy Hart's megaphone . WWF Championship . Hulk Hogan Vs King Kong Bundy . Decent pop for Hogan . One of the most over matches in Wrestlemania history . Hogan ca n't wrestle worth a lick and Bundy is not that great himself . The violence was brutal for the time but Hogan's superhero act is kind of annoying and there are too many boring moments . Hogan wins when he escapes before Bundy . Bottom line . Wrestlemania is a failure in most aspects . Die hard wrestling fans should see this once but you really do n't have too . There is n't enough here to satisfy a true wrestling fan . Vince blew it on this one . Do n't be fooled by the hype of the main event it really is a boring affair like most of the card . Not recommended and ranks as one of the worst Wrestlemania's outside of the brilliant tag title match .
2234_4.txt,0, This is the second addition to Frank Baum's personally produced trilogy of Oz films . It's essentially the same childishness as in the other two pictures although consider it preferable to the others because it's shorter . As in the other films there are performers in animal costumes an adult woman pretends to be a boy and the characters and plot jump all over the place while the camera is static . This time at the centre is a magic cloak that grants wishes and the boy played by a woman is made a king . Most of the special effects are witnessed at the beginning . Fairies are represented by multiple photography . And there's a man in the moon that looks just like those made by Georges years before most famously in Voyage dans la lune imaginative fantasies and creative trick effects made him the leading pioneer of early cinema and the films he made around the turn of the century were far better and even technically more advanced than this trifling Oz series .
3271_4.txt,0, Maybe like most others who have seen this film long after it's premiere on television wanted to see many of my favorite actors in old and obscure form which is exactly what Burn is . Except aside from the nostalgic value the movie itself is not very good . Eric Roberts plays former reporter Jacob Ash hired by a Gerald McMurty Barry a rich artist to investigate the whereabouts of his estranged son Brian who had been living with his mother Laine D'Angelo for the past few years . In a Phillip Marlowe fashion Jacob Ash narrates what would become more than just an investigation into the whereabouts of Brian . But once Jacob tracks down Laine his discoveries break open wide a whole lot of trouble . Perhaps because events in the film move too slowly there is never much suspense to this little thriller not even by the end with the finale routine of revealing the culprits and their motives . However as said before this movie is probably one that will draw attention for it's then unknown cast of actors which include both a very young Eric Roberts as well as the adorable Johnny Depp who plays Laine's stepson Donnie . That may be reason enough to give it a try . you can find it .
6452_4.txt,0, Ill verbally abusive movie studio chief runs his male assistant ragged with nit requests keeping the young man firmly under his thumb with constant threats of unemployment after a year of office the working stiff finally cracks . Writer George Huang has possibly bit off more than he can chew here . His Swimming With Sharks'' is n't a diatribe against Hollywood nor is it a tribute to the hard underling . it's stunt film with a twist a one pony with tunnel The surroundings do n't look or feel like Tinsel Town due to a limited budget and we never get a sense of this stressful environment as a movie entity could be a realtor's office in the Valley for all we know Lead Kevin Spacey who also served as one of the film's producers gives a controlled and focused performance as the power mogul whose ego is out of control he does good work and yet the character does n't ring true . We learn so little about him and his acquaintances that his important position and high status fail to jibe with what we do see who does this man answer to ? what drives him beyond humiliating others for sport ? what projects is he juggling aside from the one script we see passed around ? The film is so emotionally stunted and underpopulated it begins to seem like a stage padded out for the big screen yet one without enough characters or motivations in it . Perhaps Huang wanted to keep things simple but instead his movie looks like a half project which needed a lot more insight humor and atmosphere . from
11478_3.txt,0, saw this movie when it first came to the theaters in and though knew it was n't of award winning caliber . kinda liked it . It tales the tale of former cub scouts reuniting to take on the one task they never got to finish as kids which is to climb Mt . Whitehead . Of course now the cub scouts are all grown up and have developed their personalities in a variety of ways but none too differently than they were as children . Richard Lewis is still neurotic Richard Belzer is still a playboy Franklyn Ajaye is still sort of the Dear Abby of the group and Tim Thomerson is still the surfer dude of the group . Of course the top billed star is Louie Anderson a true believer'' in everything Cub Scout related . He still lives in the same house with his mother still goes over the Cub Scout manual daily is brave reverent and clean and is the one who reunites the others for one more grand adventure in Scouting . Compounding their task however is the Grunski brothers two bullies drummed out of the Cub Scouts by the above mentioned . By coincidence they run into their old den and decide to harass them a bit albeit harmlessly . Not so harmlessly is three escaped convicts who think Pack is from the FBI and are intent on wiping them out . All in all the movie still has bits of charm . Observe Richard Lewis trying to get comfortable on a folding cot for example and you have a really funny bit going for you . Upon further review the entire film needed more of that type of observational humor . It does n't hold up well after all these years but still remains a guilty pleasure .

5480_1.txt,0, This game was terrible . think they worked too hard on the visuals and did n't do much with the gameplay which is the most important part . mean the visuals look incredible but is the game really fun'' NO ! mean it's like hey let's jump off buildings'' and all I'm doing is holding up and The game play just is n't there and do n't agree with what Ubisoft did because they had this hot girl producer of the game Jade Raymond and they were like OK we've got this hot girl let's pimp her'' and if you go to gaming websites you're not gon na see gameplay stuff of Assassin's Creed you'll see her face with a microphone and it'll be like We interviewed Jade Raymond about her favorite cookies ! It's like man shut the UP WHO CARES ? Apparently . lot of people do because they bought the game and like it . mean compare this game with Super Mario Galaxy . Wii game that really does n't abuse the Wii Remote but STILL is very innovative and delivers in the most important part GAMEPLAY ! They were able to do a bit of everything with Mario Galaxy the graphics were still stunning the music in the game was orchestrated and sounded amazing and THAT'S a game that deserves game of the year . NOT Assassin's Creed man it does n't even deserve to even be a NOMINEE for Game of the Year . The hype around this game where it was like oh it's the next generation of gaming'' think not ! So let me get this straight here because think the people liking this game are only liking it because they're Jade fans so I'll tell you guys JADE WILL NOT MAKE OUT WITH YOU OR ANYTHING IF YOU LOVE OR DEFEND THIS GAME ! If you want a REAL game on the PS get Uncharted Drake's Fortune if you want a REAL game for the Xbox get Call of Duty a ton of other games too and if you want a REAL game just in all the systems ? GET SUPER MARIO GALAXY ! know this comment will be hated by many but seriously pressing two buttons for doing all this cool stuff is that REALLY a fun game ? The only reason why other games make it more complicated is because after it'll end up being more innovative and fun . And this game just is n't it . LIVING HELL !

All in all not nearly as good as Bava's earlier Macabre'' nor his first two Demons'' films but enjoyable enough if you can forgive the rather outrageous plot twists towards the end of the film . pity the Image Entertainment DVD lacked extras of any kind as would have been interested in some . My Grade
2705_4.txt,0, like Errol Flynn like biographies and like action movies . This featured all three of these . did n't like this film . It just went on too long although the last minutes was excellent especially in the photography with some great low angle shots . However seemed like it took six hour to get to that point and really ca n't say why feel this way . The action is interesting Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland are fine . In fact it was refreshing to see de Havilland actually be supportive of Flynn instead of her normal role as antagonist to him . Yet something is lacking in this movie . The film has been roundly criticized for its historical inaccuracy but do n't hear that same criticism for a lot of other films which have done the same . In fact its RARE when a film is historically accurate . For some reason this revisionist history offended most critics . If the film had made General Custer a lot worse than he really was they would have probably liked it . Well too bad . In their twisted way critics prefer villains to heroes . really wish could have enjoyed this more but I'll take a lot of other Flynn adventures over this one .
3391_4.txt,0, Some of the greatest and most loved horror movies have a wicked sense of humour but when a film comes along that is n't as original as the classics'' but just goes at it for laughs then a bunch of po wan na critics completely slag it off . This film made me laugh aloud several times this is testament to the way this film was approached and it shows . The two main leads look natural and believable together and this really helps this film . You root for them the whole way and laugh along with them everyone has friends like both of these guys . Another highlight for me was the monster truck it's awesome intimidating and really well shot . Taking inspiration stealing from loads of films the most obvious being Duel Jeepers Creepers and probably in reference to the Jack Black alike co Orange County . But really you can pick any road trip gone wrong movie and find a reference here . But so what it's not trying to win any Oscars just give the viewer a good dose of frights and laughs and on that score it's a Obviously It's not getting a give real sensible reviews and scores unlike of the people on IMDb . There is no this movie can get a zero like so many lazy idiots give to too many films and as fun as it was it ai n't getting a either . It's just a good fun movie for anyone with a sense of humour and a liking for scares . You really ca n't get anymore simple than that .

This movie only for ninja fans and who wants to make nostalgia . First minutes and last minutes of the movie are best . You can just see Ninja figures and fight in this scenes . Between these are below the average nearly bad as a movie . Acting is bad . Sho ninja is the best actor in this movie . Frank Nero is a good actor and charismatic but he can not fight good . Scenario is also not good . Its so simple . Franko Nero comes near to his best old friend from army and war . He also protects him from mafia but he is having sex go to bed with his wife and his friend knows this but do n't say anything to Nero negative . Is this possible in life What a friendship Finally this movie started a genre Ninja movies . Also there is the ninja master Sho Kasugi but some fighting scenes are not realistic and not fast even with shoo . This film is below the average even it is a classic .

One of them works as a babysitter for a married man who's hot for her anyone Meanwhile a vice cop is borrowed by homicide when he's the first to discover one of the siblings victims . He's teamed with a female assistant of the District Attorney . Nothing too special here . Richard Roundtree has little more than a cameo as the police chief .

7227_4.txt,0, If Daphne Du Maurier had set REBECCA in San Francisco it might very well resemble this uptight highly unusual noir from Robert Wise . Valentina Cortese plays a concentration camp survivor who steals the identity of a dead woman and insinuates herself into the life of Richard Basehart happens also to be the guardian of the dead woman's son absurd and over but also topflight entertainment . Cortese is terrific slowly falling apart as she realizes the mistake she's made . Basehart is fine if a bit bland . the lighting toward the end makes him appear very menacing . Fay Baker makes a very good Mrs. Danvers caretaker . Wise is a fine director and he keeps things moving at a pretty brisk clip . He also stages a now classic out of control car crash with Cortese at least a stunt Cortese at the wheel .
4855_2.txt,0, Although this film has had a lot of praise personally found it boring . There are some nice Brasilian sunsets and the characters are believable but the story of how they interrelate even if very unusual by our standards is not interesting enough to sustain a movie this long . The central woman takes up with one man after another in a close knit way and putting the interests of her children first . As the tolerance of the various men is stretched we see their characters develop . The story unfolds with dignity and aided by excellent acting . It is a rare glimpse into the Brasilian hinterland far from the city but hardly exciting enough to keep one's eyes open for .
380_2.txt,0, This one kind of is like an earlier movie from Masters of the Universe'' based on the cartoon He Basically you have a great old world and they for some reason have to have nearly all the action of the movie take place on modern earth . Well guess it is not so modern earth now and that it is an ancient world now of strangeness and a den of good times gone by . Well guess can figure why they did in fact place nearly all the movie in modern times in this and that movie . To save money on costumes and sets . It is a lot easier to recreate what is going on in the present than a strange world like that of Eternia in He or an ancient world with cults and strange pyramids sacrifices and strange creatures that hug you to death . This movie is forgettable and not very entertaining your first clue that it is not going to be the best movie in the world is that Robert Z'Dar is in it . The only thing this one has going for it is the animals which are not as prevalent in this one as they were in the last . Marc Singer is back and it is sad to seem him in this state the guy was a fairly good actor reduced to trying to make a sequel to a movie that really did not need one and even if it did it came five years to late .

Lynn as I'm sure you all know should plays the critical role of Driver'' Unfortunately other than Lynn's amazing performance I'm afraid this movie does n't really have much going for it . Oh wait there was one other thing the amazing creativity of the editing to remove profanity for TV viewers . Memorable lines like You son You son Shoot ! and Well Forget You ! Bye . Does anyone know where can get another Lynn Peterson poster ?

It was all over the place all the time . It had no tension we all knew Bobby was going to curse and throw things but Brian Denehy a fine actor comes across as mailing in the anger and delivering zero tension . Cheaply shot like a MacGiver episode . Contrast this Thanksgiving main course with the job HBO did on the Don King movie only in America'' to show how to do sports biopics warts and all . Notice that ESPN promoted the hell out of it and then never showed it again ?
17_3.txt,0, Might end up being the biggest disappointment that will see in seem to be the rare person who disliked Park's Oldboy but think that his Lady Vengeance'' and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance'' are among the best films I've seen in the decade . Therefore really was looking forward to see this especially as it got such positive reviews . Instead found the film clich and broke little if any new ground to the vampire genre . And while can appreciate a bit of gallows humor in movies like this felt Park did this at very inopportune times . Others have compared this to Let the Right One In and have to say that Let the Right One In'' was far superior to this one and was a fresh take on the vampire genre . Sadly Park's take was a tired one .
887_2.txt,0, In all honesty have n't seen this film for many years but the few times have tend to make parts of it stick in my memory as anyone who has seen it will understand . first saw it as a child at a YMCA Halloween party in the early Sixties and it scared the hell out of us kids in a fun way . remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze . ca n't risk giving away the ending except to say that it was surprising to say the least . remember vaguely the entire audience of young boys letting out a big scared holler followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed . The ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny climaxes to a movie in film history and yet oddly moving in a way . You have to see it for yourself which is not easy these days . do n't know if it's available on home video or not but it would still make a great Halloween feature for both kids and adults .

The Kindred although have not as yet got a copy is high priority as all the old movies did n't like back then now own and have now re and think they are brilliant and the bits do remember of the Kindred are now driving me to want to get hold of a copy Hurray for the and long live horror !
2400_1.txt,0, The filmmakers neglected to connect the dots is the sequence of events and choices that led from Charlie Wilson and the anti mujaheddin to Al Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden and eventually to The filmmakers of course neglect to tell us the back were the Soviets in Afghanistan ? that omission pales in comparison to their failure to reveal that support for Islamicist extremists in Afghanistan in the name of rabid anti ultimately strengthened the hand of anti forces and was a big contributing factor to the mess that we find ourselves in today terrorist networks a prolonged ground war in Afghanistan etc . Because these consequences are not spelled out the movie leaves the viewer feeling sympathetic to Mr. Wilson check out his latest projects on the Internet instead of seeing him as an individual whose actions were contrary to the best interests of his country and the West as a whole .
3031_4.txt,0, DIRTY WAR Aspect ratio Sound format Stereo Emergency services struggle to cope when Islamic terrorists detonate a so bomb in the middle of London . Daniel Percival's frightening movie uses all available evidence to dramatize the possible effects of a radioactive explosion in the heart of the UK capital using the kind of documentary realism which has distinguished this particular subgenre since the In essence the film reveals a catalogue of flaws in the British government's current strategy for dealing with such terrorist outrages and Percival's carefully script by Lizzie Mickery vents its spleen against mealy politicians who would rather maintain the economic status quo than tackle this issue head The film covers all necessary bases and makes the salient point that this kind of terrorism is practised by a tiny handful of fanatics who have tarnished the Islamic faith with their reckless disregard for human life though viewers wo n't be reassured by the subsequent scenes of devastation and horror . Not merely a drama the film acts as a warning against complacency . Either that or its just another post scaremongering tactic . YOU be the judge .
5521_4.txt,0, HAPPY DAYS was one of my favorite shows when it aired in But the critics were quick to show their ignorance combined with a total lack of a sense of humor by slamming this show because they thought it was a cheap attempt to cash on the success of American GRAFFITTI . There were some similarities between American GRAFFITTI and HAPPY DAYS . Both opened with Rock Around the Clock'' by Bill Haley the Comets . Both took place in a bygone era and both featured Ron Howard as one of the leading roles . But there were also some major differences . While American GRAFFITTI took place in California and centered around a group of newly graduated high school students about to take that big step into adulthood HAPPY DAYS took place in Milwaulkee Wisconson and centered around a group of teenagers in high school dealing with the joys and tribulations of adolescence . HAPPY DAYS originally opened with the juke box playing the original version of Bill Haley the Comets ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK . But when oldies became hot thanks to the success of American GRAFFITTI and the original version of ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK entered the Billboard Hot and became a hit again in royalty payments went through the roof . So a remake'' of the song correct term is now new stereo recording'' was quickly substituted . The current theme song for HAPPY DAYS was then introduced for the second season if memory serves me right . Fans and foes alike agree that this show is escapist . Liberties were taken and details overlooked making this show less than completely authentic . This is perfectly fine . HAPPY DAYS is supposed to be a comedy not a history lesson . But occasionally the writers did sometimes stick their necks out by hitting on controversial topics . One episode centered around the Cunninghams building of a fall out shelter . Another episode was about a divorced woman moving into the neighborhood with a dream of starting a new life . The topic of prejudice was addressed when Howard was invited to the wedding of an old army buddy who just happened to be black an era when prejudice and discrimination was sadly an acceptable part of the American way of life The issue of the draft even came up on a later episode ! The show as originally set in One problem that was dealt wisely was with the cast . Most of them were teenagers and as each year passed it was obvious that they grew older so the series aged with the cast moving the series out of the safe waters of the Eisenhower years into the Age of Camelot all the way with JFK and then into the turbulent later half of the That along with the writers running out of ideas and later cast members like Ron Howard leaving the series wisely quitting while they were ahead left me wishing that they had all done the right thing by pulling the plug on this show and quitting while they were ahead . That along with the idol worshiping studio audience who just could n't control themselves every time the Great Fonzie entered the scene began to wear very thin very fast . This show originally portrayed the Fabulous Fifties as we LIKE to remember that era . Time heals wounds you know . Everything has its place and though would prefer hearing the original hit versions'' over those new stereo recordings'' those new stereo recordings'' worked very well on HAPPY DAYS . And this is where find myself regretting my buying the DVD ! Unlike the complete first season DVD the original music on the complete second season has been replaced with different music . While it is great that the original episodes were digitally restored to digital perfection the removal of the original music destroyed what it was that made this show so much fun to watch !
490_2.txt,0, First of all the genre of this movie is n't comedy it's more of a drama . had low expectations on the movie and still they did n't come up them . As some of the other reviews point out there are some nice music in the movie . But if you want to listen to good music suggest spend the time looking at some concert recording with Bon Jovi or Crue it'll be more quality time . Last if you want to watch a GOOD movie in this rock'n genre recommend Almost Famous''

Like many comments good fight sequences particularly liked his answering of the phone at the restaurant saying how long it would be closed for restoration . Bit like Schwarzenegger's humour in the earlier action films although that tended to be self But the one like here is Brian Cox . One of the most versatile actors around . Pity about his hand and foot but so much for withstanding extended interrogation must have flunked that class at the farm'' As the films went on wonder just how the ever thickening girth of Seagal affected his movement ? Never mind it's entertainment !
1003_4.txt,0, This tale of the upper getting their come and wallowing in their high misery is like a contemporary Mid version of an old Joan Crawford movie in which she suffered in mink . Here people behave in a frightfully civilized manner in the face of adversity . well London solicitor Wilkinson discovers that not only is his wife having an affair with the local gentry but that she has also killed their housekeeper's husband in a hit accident . He throws up but otherwise his stiff hardly quavers . Written and directed by Julian Fellowes who won an Oscar for writing Gosford Park'' is his directorial debut from a novel by Nigel Balchin it's quite comical although am not sure how much of the comedy is intended . It's like a throw to British films of the forties where characters all behaved like characters in books or plays rather than like people might in real life . However it's not all bad . Wilkinson is terrific even if you never believe in him as a person while Emily Watson adulterous wife and Rupert Everett highly amoral high totty are both very good at covering the cracks in the material . Tony Pierce cinematography ensures that no matter how hard it is on the ear it's always good on the eye .
9607_1.txt,0, As a parent of two girls and have grave doubts about this show and all the shows aimed at tweens . First am always amazed that the living conditions of Drake Zac Hanna Carly Derek Sunny etc . always make most houses look tiny and cramped . Most people work hard all day to pay for living quarters less than half the size yet on these shows nobody is going or coming from work paying utility mortgage or insurance bills mopping sweeping changing lightbulbs fixing toilets Just walking in and out down the ubiquitous wide stairs that only exist on TV sets cracking jokes of which involve lying and the hilarious results and shirking work . think kids watching these will have unrealistic expectations on how hard they will work and how luxurious their lives will be . Second there is never an intact family always a Mom or Dad but never both who are always going on sexless dates but never seem to have any of the downside of divorce support arguments Again kids may get the impression that if mom get divorced there will be fun fun fun mom or dad are often not around if that helps the plot Needless to say there is no mention of spirituality specific religion Finally there is a theme that troubles me . There are nerds'' that are good in school jocks'' good in sports goody two shoes'' as well . The protagonists are not good at school sports or charitable but make wisecracks about those who are . The message is do n't be good at anything just be one of the nothings'' who blend in cracking jokes . Needless to say give all these shows a zero and turn them off all the time and am just short of forbidding them in my house .

2545_4.txt,0, This film has some nice special effects tearing apart the Japanese archipelago to a degree that would humble Godzilla . The two leads also put in above performances . Apart from that it is all a bit ropey in this understated disaster flick . The incongruities in the pacing are bizarre . At one point we have Hokkaido sinking into the sea and pyroclastic snow falling on the rest of Japan while Osaka is buried under an immense tsunami . Yet elsewhere in the country people are still strolling around sightseeing and licking ice when another tsunami rolls in . Kusanagi also manages to travel great distances without any hindrance or even a crease in his cream shirt . Other people turn up with burns ripped clothes and mud on their faces . The Japaneseness of the film is both touching and repugnant . Kusanagi's sacrifice in his final evening with Shibasaki is a touch of chivalry seldom seen in this genre these days . However the ill PMs musings on the Japanese psyche and the seduction of death and the fact that Japan is abandoned by everyone and has no friends in the last instance hint at a darker paranoia that infects Japanese concerns regarding their status in the world . Sadly the final sequence is a rip of Armaggedon edited with a cookie Finally my own particular bug the heavy handed product placement for cigarettes . This time around it is mad scientist Toyokawa who gets to be the poster boy for Japan Tobacco . At one point he manages to light up meters below the ocean surface in a miniature sub the size of a phone box . Gim me a break .
266_4.txt,0, enjoyed Oceans thought it was quite enjoyable helped by the performances and the direction . However was disappointed with this film . Do n't get me wrong it is not a complete dud thanks to the stellar performances from Brad Pitt Catherine Zeta George Clooney and Matt Damon especially and the efficient direction from Steven Soderbergh . However the film really does suffer from truly lethargic pacing some of the film was so slow almost fell asleep between one key twist . Second the plot is very convoluted and there are many twists and turns that makes it hard to keep up . The camera work was n't as innovative as it was in the first movie either . Whereas in the first movie it was smooth and professional it was jerky and awkward here and the music was n't particularly memorable . The screenplay also was n't as witty or as fun and the film felt anti At the end of the day it all felt a bit too lazy despite the expert playing and direction . So much potential but really a missed opportunity . Bethany Cox
1731_3.txt,0, My summary refers to the fact that this film has votes short of making it eligible to be on IMDb's infamous Bottom list lowest rated films on the website . With a paltry score of only this would place the film at approximately between and on the list about a very dubious achievement ! My score of is n't that bad it does bring the film that much closer to the dreaded list . As for the film it stars the once Aaron Carter another prepackaged and forgettable pop star of the When he first broke onto the scene he was a cute kid with some songs that appealed to pre and tweeners on Radio Disney . His songs look and image were all scrupulously groomed and created by marketing folks and did the trick to some huge album sales . Unfortunately by sales were in decline and Carter had hit his awkward stage of life ALL kids his age have to deal with eventually . To put it bluntly he is n't cute any more in this film and is at a very tough stage of life . assume now he's a gorgeous young man . in Popstar'' he's no longer the heart he once was . Here he is just very normal . death sentence for a kid in his position as a pop sensation'' Interestingly the film has some appearances by some other ex heart from the last few decades a roles for David Cassidy and Leif Garrett guys who also know what it's like to disappear from the limelight . Cassidy managed to pick up the pieces and make a niche for himself while Garrett is a great example of a pop star whose life after stardom has been a bit of a joke . Hopefully Carter will take after Cassidy in the future and so far thankfully he's managed to avoid the negative publicity and court appearances of many ex idols . was far from thrilled with the film but seriously wish him best in this department . It's not his fault he was plastered across the radio and television throughout the early to mid In this film Carter does n't exactly need to stretch himself plays a pop star . However despite making millions and being adored by girls he does n't have it all'' He's quite dense because he has little interest in learning . The problem is so bad that his mother decides to no longer home school him him to go to public school . The problem though is that he is rather phobic about taking tests . making the grade in school is difficult . So he gets the idea of finding a smart girl to date who would naturally be obliged to help him out in school . He picks the cute but bookish Jane Austin and pretends to really like her in a sad attempt to make this scheme work . This plot by the way is n't bad and could work even though it seems a lot like an episode of a show like The Brady Bunch'' or a Nickelodeon sit Sure it's predictable and you KNOW that the formula will mean that she will eventually learn his plot and be hurt AND he will eventually realize that he actually does care for her AND by the end of the film all will be forgiven and they'll be a real couple . But given good acting and competent direction this could be worth seeing for his teen fans as predictable is n't always bad . And as it turned out this IS N'T exactly where the plot went . it was awfully close . There are a few good things liked about the film . Seeing Tom Bosley and Stella Stevens playing Jane's grandparents was very nice role was quite sweet and it was good seeing them again . Also made for TV movie star Andrew Stevens appeared in the film was nice to see him again part of me hated him as he looks so great after all these years and look ever bit of my years ! He did a fine job and it was nice seeing him in the same film as his mother As for Carter with his many prior experiences on TV he was not surprisingly pretty good . While his relationship with Jane did n't seem very believable he and Ms. Austin gave it their best . The film was n't great but they did try and think most of the problems with the film were in the writing a better and less formulaic plot it could have worked much better . Plus the whole testophobia'' angle seemed pretty contrived . rather insignificant . Who cares if a mega star gets anxious taking tests in school ? Overall not a rotten film as the current rating would imply though there is n't much here to attract a wide audience . People who grew up loving Carter probably will enjoy the film . Older folks will probably care less as well as really young people who probably have n't heard of him . For them there is no nostalgia value in the film . My favorite part of the film . Garrett giving Aaron advice . felt like screaming do n't listen ! but did n't !

The Party used to be centrist too but that was another era . Now like Larry it's Far Left . At least percent of all the guests on King's show in the past year or two are Liberals who sit there and bash President Bush and every Conservative they can think of . after night . Bill Mahar one of the more viscous ones is and you can look this up the most frequent guest in the history of King's TV show . You can count on other outspoken Left Wingers to be on King's show each week but do n't hold your breath waiting for a Conservative . They are few and far between . King was also one of the innovators of the media overkill . That all began with the Simpson trial . Night after night after night that's all you ever saw back in the mid Whatever latest gossip on Anna Nicole Smith or the Petersen murder case or Paris Hilton Britney Spears or some other tabloid subject you can bet Larry will beat it to death . Sadly all the other networks do the same thing now . Larry was a leader in that regard . King also has the nerve to sometimes give advice such as on marriage . am not kidding heard him say it . The joke is that he has been married and divorced a half dozen times ! This man has few scruples believe me . When it comes to morality he is clueless . Maybe that's why he has Dr. Phil on to explain some facts of life to him regularly . Larry will nod but he does n't understand any more than when Billy Graham used to talk to him . King also is becoming famous for the softball'' interview meaning he asks no hard questions . That is a lot due to the fact that most his guests are of his political persuasion . People know being on King's show is liking having an hour public relations gig . What all this has meant is a serious decline in ratings the past five years .

Edgar Rice wrote about a dangerous African Jungle and Apes were killers and hunters . We know differently now and this movie portrays Apes in a more modern view . I've never seen a Tarzan movie that even comes close to Edgar's vision . Maybe one day Hollywood with trust talented and respected authors to tell the story . So if you've never read the book and enjoy a good story about feelings and a fluffy bunny view of wild animals maybe a good cry see the movie . hope John Carter of Mars get's more respect than Tarzan has . We miss ya Edgar !
10659_2.txt,0, The pace of this movie is quite slow . It takes about minutes to get Katie to China we know that she will and leaves minutes to wrap things up . The storyline is so predictable that you know everything after about minutes . Nothing surprises you . guess that the movie is a coming of age movie but the movie is full of stereotypes that are quite over the top Katie beauty that realizes that looks boys and shopping is n't everything . She realizes that she can feel'' and see the real world'' Touching . The mother high strung nervous screaming mother very innovative that need taking care of by a strong man . The father patient and always understanding and takes care of the incapable woman . The boyfriend that only wants to get into her pants . The comedian clown Chinese guy that does n't know how to speak English properly and made a laughing stock . Thought Hollywood dropped those characters in the mid fifties . The nurse that at times knows everything how to get around in China that in the next moment is a carbon copy of The mother a woman who cant handle the situation or knows anything . The deformed Chinese girl that with the help of us westerns get help and become a beautiful girl . Because in China third world country according to the film do n't have anything and hence needs our charity . Gah wake up and smell what you are shoveling . Sure that there are some poverty in China but the portrayal of the aid from western countries USA is so shallow and happy ending that it is sad and revolting . Shanghai the movie is set is the most expanding and evolving city in the world at the moment . The Chinese father that is so nice and goodhearted that in the end has one wish to be a cowboy with a white hat The teacher Astin that has this really heart ripping story that he tells without feel . Why Sean ? WHY ! Etc etc . It is difficult to actually finding a real'' person in the entire movie . This is nothing but a feel good movie for Americans below age If you want to learn anything about the world watch Hotel Rwanda instead . For a better life story or coming of age movie suggest you watch the Italian Cinema Paradiso'' that won the best foreign film academy reward some years back . The only nice thing in the movie were the small town sceneries that truly capture some all of the beautiful Chinese country side . have been there and seen some of it .
883_4.txt,0, If you read the book before seeing the movie you may be disappointed like was . The book was great and was sure after seeing the movie preview that the movie would be great as well however felt like was watching a movie where the director and cast did not even read what these characters where like . The movie is short and they do not really ever make us feel that these people were truly in love and felt like sole mates . Even if the movie did not go in the same direction as the book at least they could of made the romance between these two characters feel more intense . think both Diane Lane and Richard Gere were perfect for these two characters and they have good chemistry however they just did not develop a long enough storyline for us to see how they longed for each other . The book was true love story and think this movie could of been a lot better .
10050_4.txt,0, From time to time it's very advisable for the aristocracy to watch some silent film about the harsh life of the common people in order to remind themselves of the privileges and the comfortable life that they have enjoyed since the beginning of mankind or even before'' in comparison with the complicated and hard work that common people have to endure everyday since the aristocrats rule the world . And that's what happens in The Love Light'' the first film directed by Dame France Marion who will be famous afterwards in the silent and talkie world thanks overall to her work as a screenwriter better for her certainly because her career as a film director does n't impress this German count . The film tells the story of Dame Angela Carlotti Dame Mary Pickford a merry Italian girl who lives surrounded by a picturesque squalor'' an important difference of opinion between upper and low classes aristocrats prefers to live surrounded by picturesque luxury'' she has two brothers and a secret admirer but all she gives him in return is indifference . Destiny begins to work hard and pretty soon war is declared and Dame Angela's two brothers enlist and in the next reel both are dead . But destiny is even crueller and Dame Angela meanwhile falls in love with'' a German ! And to make things worse she does n't know that her Teutonic sweetie is a spy and that the light signals that she sends to him every night from the lighthouse she maintains thinking that is a love signal do n't mean Ich Liebe Dich'' but Sink Any Damn Italian Boat At Sea'' Fortunately for Dame Angela pretty soon her sweetie German spy will be found by the neighbours in her house in which she was hiding him a not strange fact indeed because it is not an easy task for a German to go unnoticed'' but the German spy will prefer to die before being captured by those Italians . From that German love a half baby will born the wicked Destiny at full speed'' but a greedy neighbour who has a particular idea of motherhood will carry away her son with the consent of a Catholic nun who has taken the Council of Trent to extremes'' a fact that will put Dame Angela at the verge of insanity . But meanwhile Dame Angela's secret admirer has returned from the war and you can think that finally Dame Angela's sorrowful life will improve a tremendous mistake because Destiny has in store for her that the returned soldier is blind . But as they say in Germany it may be a blessing in disguise and finally Dame Angela will recover her son and will start a new life with her blind sweetie in a poor Italian village in what it is supposed to be a happy ending for the common people . As this German count said before it was much better for Dame Frances Marion that she continued her career as a screenwriter because as can be seen in The Love Light'' she had a lot of imagination to invent incredible stories ja wohl ! but a completely different subject is to direct films and her silent debut lacks emotion and rhythm in spite of the effort of Dame Pickford to involve the audience with her many disgraces . The nonexistent film narrative causes indifference in the spectator making this the kind of film where only Dame Pickford herself provides the interest and not her circumstances . And now if you'll allow me must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must send Morse signals from the Schloss north tower to one of his Teutonic rich heiress .
7945_2.txt,0, Los Angeles Indie film brat John Carpenter fresh out of film school and with one film his class project's no spoof of called Dark Star under his belt finishes a gritty actioner called Assault On Precinct The story of an almost deserted police station under siege by an unseen LA gang it was a minor hit on the drive circuit and garnered small praise from the few critics who cared but it hardly set the film world on fire unlike Carpenter's follow smash Halloween On Precinct Carpenter was still learning how to exploit his almost non budget by using lower actors keeping the action to the one hellishly small location and moving the film along at a tight pace with a combination of editing intelligent camera work and switched genre savvy . No wants or needs to be hungry in Hollywood anymore particularly if the week's catering bill on the version of Assault On Precinct is more than the entire cost of the original . It does translate into a certain kind of laziness on a filmmaker's part you have a stupidly large union crew a studio and a marketing firm all doing your thinking for you . Which is why twenty years after watching Carpenter's film can still see every glorious moment from the small girl gunned down in cold blood while buying an ice cream to the relentless pounding synth score . week after Assault remember Larry Fishburne's unmoving ping pong ball eyes and little else . Forgettable popcorn actioner'' fits the top of the poster perfectly . It's New Years Eve at Precinct a station closing down with a skeleton staff to see in its final hours . On call is Jake Roenick Hawke an ex now deeply troubled and hopped up on Jack Daniels and Seconol after his partners were iced in the opening scene Iris Sopranos Drea de Matteo a nympho with a thing for criminal types and Jasper Dennehy a crusty old timer one scotch away from retirement . As in Carpenter's Assault . a bus with four heavy criminals is rerouted to the Precinct . All boozy eyes are on gangster kingpin Bishop still beefed from his time in the Matrix who has narrowly survived an assassination attempt from an undercover cop and plans to blow the lid on the endemic corruption in the organized crime unit led by Marcus Duvall tired Gabriel Byrne Soon the phones are out the power lines are down and both crims and police find themselves heavily armed with a serious police arsenal and consumed with paranoia while waging war against a task force of Duvall's corrupt cops sporting white balaclavas bullet vests infra bazookas and more high gear than the Skywalker Ranch . This we're expected to believe as the helicopters buzz around the top of the police station shooting rockets into windows is a clandestine operation to cover Duvall's tracks . He may as well have taken out billboards on Hollywood Boulevard . As with the recent Seventies genre reworking Dawn Of The Dead Assault takes the barest plot essentials of John Carpenter's original and to quote the Seventies does it's own thing man'' The main question is why bother ? John Carpenter's is a cult favorite among genre buffs but is hardly branded in the public's collective consciousness . Carpenter himself was busy reworking Howard Hawks classic western Rio Bravo into a tight claustrophobic urban thriller for only French wunderkind director and rap producer Jean Richet a self fan of John Carpenter's work seems less concerned with making an homage to either Hawks or JC although the script is peppered with references to cowboys and injuns and seems intent on squeezing in as much flash and firepower as the multi dollar budget can withstand . The result some tense moments with hand POV cameras an unexpectedly high bloody body count a few neat plot twists but essentially a urban actioner with a much inflated price tag . As for name Carpenter it's pure conceit on the part of the filmmakers that does n't pay off . To Monsieur Richet say bon voyage and wish you luck on your music career .

I'm also not going to go on and on about everything thats wrong with this movie because I'll be here for ages if do . The storyline is typical and the special effects are below today's standards . This is not a movie you should watch if you are a serious movie buff most of us here are little things will annoy you the whole movie and ruin the experience . If your a casual movie watcher who likes to have a good time when they are watching a flick then this movie is perfect for you lots of fun . It would also be a good movie to take a partner to .

4213_1.txt,0, Summary Not worth the film As an avid Gone With the Wind fan was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters . Luckily the film on its own was a wonderful piece . When the book Scarlett came out read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together . While the book lacks any true quality it remains a good story and as long as was able to separate it from the original was and still is enjoyable . However consider the six hours spent watching the Scarlett'' miniseries to be some of the worst hours of my life . Discrediting any of the original character traits so well in Margaret Mitchell's book this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape mistrust murder and misformed relationships that even the book Scarlett stayed away from . The casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well in both the original novel and film and even carried through in the second book and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character . In the novel Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her estranged husband Rhett Butler to Charleston under the guise of visiting extended family . After coming to an arrangement'' with Rhett she agrees to leave and proceeds to reconnect with her O'Hara relatives in Savannah . Eventually she accompanies her cousin Colum a passionate leader of the Fenian Brotherhood to Ireland to further explore her family's roots that go deep and is eventually named The O'Hara the head of the family . While her duties as The O'Hara keep her engaged in her town of Ballyhara Scarlett ventures out into the world of the English landowners and instantly becomes a sought guest at many of their parties . She having been scorned by Rhett time and time again eventually agrees to marry Luke the earl of Fenton until Rhett comes along in a clich night type of a rescue . The Scarlett'' miniseries fails even to do this justice . Raped by her fianc and scorned by her family the series shows Scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed . heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision .
6610_4.txt,0, Well for a start must say that here in Russia a saga of Geralt of Rivia is known and loved . Andrzej Sapkowski a gifted writer or maybe even genius of some sort created one of the most realistic honest cynical and God well written fantasy worlds in a history of literature . And when such amazing material gets in a right hands well see RPG game Witcher'' and you will understand what am talking about . Vedmak is an excellent example of the opposite outcome . Lack of budget . Lack of directing . Lack of good script . These three whales of Disgusting Movie Making sunken this movie ate it alive . Acting is good sometimes even more than good but for god sake it can not save this project . still have some faith though . still hope that someday a new Vedmak movies will be created and entire world will see magnitude and breathtaking splendor of Sapkowski's books . But before that a Uwe Boll must be eliminated . Just in case you know

11760_1.txt,0, You ca n't really blame the movie maker for glorifying Che because the industry is all about money . Most of the stories you hear about this freedom fighter'' are absolute tripe fabricated by the communist Cuban government after Che's death . Che was a murdering scumbag from day one . Here's a list of the great things Che did for Cuba Executed thousands of innocent Cuban Men Women AND CHILDREN to satisfy his lust for power . Destroyed Cuba's economy and good standing with the rest of the world . The Cuban peso used to be equal with the American dollar . Now it's basically worthless . Continually failed at all things that involved diplomacy economy and the military . He never made it past his first year in Medical School and he was only in one real battle in which he surrendered with a fully loaded gun . He took over the largest estate in Cuba to set up for himself . He had a Yacht a custom made TV from America a swimming pool and a view of the Ocean . So much for shunning the materialist life style . Cuba today is an absolutely destitute country and you have no one but Che and the Castro brothers to thank for it . If you go to Cuba today you will not be allowed out of the tourist areas . If you did manage to get out of what you're meant to see you would find slums beggars and prostitutes . If you think any of what I'm saying is untrue then go do some studying . Compare Cuban exports from to those of today talk with people who survived or who had parents in the so called Cuban revolution'' of the read all of the reports of murdered innocents read the reports from people who served under Che and Castro and fled because of what an evil disgusting human being he was . And please please always remember to read or watch EVERYTHING objectively . Stop taking everything at face value and THINK ABOUT IT .
2402_1.txt,0, SPOILER This film gives away plot points and discusses the ending . hated this film mostly for political reasons but also for moral and aesthetic reasons . Politically this film glorified war and military technology blowing things up real good . We are led to cheer as the music swells and the Afghans use our weapons to blow the Ruskies to bits . And no soldiers put their lives on the line so it's a fun war . Aesthetically there is n't a touch of real human emotion in the film just smug privileged people being sarcastic feeling superior and doing whatever they want regardless of the consequences . And speaking of consequences the film only makes a few small hits at what the arming of the Afghans actually led to . had read an earlier draft of this script and it ended on with Charlie Wilson realizing that things had gone horribly wrong . But that would n't leave the audience feeling good . This is a feel good movie about killing Ruskies . And it made me sick .
6221_1.txt,0, love musicals all of them from joyous Oklahoma to Poignant Porgy and Bess to the touching romantic Damn Yankees . And know most of the songs sometimes singing them spontaneously with a crowd or humming them alone . In a real'' musical as differentiated from this vaudeville show every song is painstakingly crafted to fit the exact moment . It is an expression of sadness regret love joy or exaltation natural extension where mere words fail . So in Guys and Dolls My Time of Day'' describes the adventurous life of Sky Masterson as it is about to be compromised by the most unlikely woman . Every song in this brilliant exemplar of the genre sets a mood or develops a character creating a phantasmagoria of place turned absolutely believable by the self disclosing evocations of song . For this lover of the Broadway Musical and their adaptations to the screen during the last half of the century Mama Mia is somewhere between satire and a cruel fun house distortion of the genre . There the songs of these musicals advanced the often elaborate often delightful plot lines . While here the songs simply picked up from a collection only interfered with the shaky premise of the film . Perhaps most of those viewers who are making this film into a monumental success simply have no exposure to the art form of century Musicals . They have no idea of the magic performed by writer and lyricist that can turn a dance hall floozy into someone whom we know and love as achieved in Sweet Charity . Let me offer an apology for the arrogance of this review . Perhaps another day another mood could have gotten into it and not have been so critical in this review . But ca n't help but imagining what Richard Roger Oscar Hammerstein Cole Porter Irving Berlin and so many others could have done even with with this silly premise . think about it while the memories of seeing this film is fresh and can not help but to mourn the great loss .
11625_4.txt,0, When was a little girl absolutely adored The Swan Princess it was reliving the same fairy tales of Snow White Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella the princess and her prince who saves the day is always a timeless story that will never die well hopefully . But figured that would check out the sequels for The Swan Princess to see what they were like and unfortunately this is the typical cartoon sequel that just disappoints more than entertains . The only character found still very amusing was the Queen she was very funny in this movie and had the best part . But with the voice changes they were noticeable and also bothered me quite a bit do n't mean to be picky just it was too weird for me . The story also was just more or less borrowed from the first Swan Princess just the villain in this movie is following Rothbart's footsteps . Odette and Derek are about to celebrate their one year anniversary but Derek has been too preoccupied with fighting for his kingdom to keep it safe . With his mother's birthday also coming up he forgets about that since there is a new villain in town Clavious who is hoping to go above and beyond where Rothbart's powers went and kidnaps the Queen on her birthday . But Odette must change back into her swan self in order to help Derek fight him and save his mother . The Swan Princess is of course more than alright for the kids that never mind it's good clean fun for them . The reason why these sequels are disappointing though is because it is usually just for the kids that is the audience they aim for but it's more enjoyable when the jokes and story can be enjoyed by everyone . Now there are a few laughs and giggles here and there but this was n't as clever in my opinion to the first Swan Princess . would recommend it for the little one's but if you're looking for a fun cartoon movie I'd recommend staying with the first Swan Princess .
9336_3.txt,0, Solomon and Sheba has come down in Hollywood lore not for the quality of the film but for the fact that Tyrone Power died while making it . was in the grade and well remember the huge news for days when that tragedy happened . did n't know who Tyrone Power was then but learned and learned to appreciate the body of his work . often wonder if Ty had a sense about this film and what a dud it proved . He was the unnamed producer of this as well . Maybe he just did n't want to face the critics . Good thing Power actually went out with Witness for the Prosecution although you can see him in long shots if you look close . What we have here is a biblical stew that probably would baffle the great Solomon himself . Several incidents described in the Bible that the Bible treats separately are woven together into one plot with a few additions tossed in by Hollywood . The actual story about the Queen of Sheba is that she went on a trade mission to the Kingdom of Israel chatted Solomon up a bit came back with a lot of trade goods and that was that . The story of a romance between her and Solomon is of legend . The ancient kingdom of Sheba is about where Yemen is now and her people purportedly moved to the African continent which is how Ethiopia was founded . The Queen never witnessed Solomon's famous case involving the two women with separate claims for a baby nor was she involved with the building of the First Temple . Nor was she around for the destruction of same . For that matter neither was Solomon . And she was not involved in the dispute over the succession when Solomon's brother Adonijah put in a counterclaim . That is the heart of this film . Adonijah upon hearing the news that King David is dying declares himself king . Of course David rallies temporarily and says that God came to him and said Solomon should succeed him . When David hears about what Adonijah did he says that's what got God all bent out of shape Adonijah being greedy . After that Adonijah gets to plotting . Things seem to come full circle in that Ty Power collapsed on the set while dueling with George Sanders as Adonijah . Sanders and Power were rivals in many films most particularly in Lloyds of London which was Power's breakthrough role . If Sanders is not quite the jaded sophisticate he was in Samson and Delilah he's still Sanders the biblical cad . When Power died Yul Brynner was brought in to play Solomon and given a wig so that existing footage of Power in long shot could be salvaged . Brynner invests the dialog with the proper dignity but think he probably regretted doing the pinch hitting . Gina Lollobrigida is the Queen of Sheba and she is alluring as a biblical temptress in the Cecil DeMille tradition . She seems not to have any real conviction and my guess is she was shocked at Power's sudden demise and having to do it all over again . Marisa Pavan as Abishag may give the best performance in the film . The real story with Adonijah is not as elaborate as this film . He disputed with Solomon for the succession and gathered around a group of some of King David's court as supporters . Solomon pardoned them once and then Adonijah asked for Abishag in marriage . Abishag in the Bible and here was an adopted daughter of King David in his old age . When Solomon hears that he decides Adonijah is getting greedy again and has him killed . The Bible mentions someone named Berniah who was going around basically doing contract hits on Adonijah's supporters . What we have in the film is a spectacular climax involving a miracle that searched for and could n't find . It came from the fertile imagination of director King Vidor who ended a long and distinguished career on a sour note . It was a question of Vidor trying to out do Cecil DeMille in biblical spectacle . He did n't make it .
3547_4.txt,0, Tom Cutler is a retired policeman who now works as a crime scene Cleaner In his latest job he cleans a new crime scene and destroys evidence and is n't aware the crime has n't been officially reported . Uh oh this ca n't be good . You hear about Cleaners all the time but usually when a mob or gangland hit is involved when bodies etc need to be removed and the area cleaned up . This one is different in that Tom Cutler works with the Police to clean up after the police have done their investigation of a crime scene . Hey someone has to do it . You know the Police wo n't . The movie makes that quite clear and it is up to the family to get the area cleaned up . This is almost a good thriller but a side plot involving Tom's daughter makes this story somewhat awkward . guess they had to fill in some time . Oh they brought this side plot around to connect with the another side plot but it was still a reach and awkward . See ? This was almost a good thriller because there was a noticeable lack of tension suspense and the pace was somewhat draggy . The music did n't help either as noticed the music was more appropriate for watching people take a long journey . You know journey music . Get it ? HA ! The acting by all was excellent in this almost a good thriller . Violence Yes Sex No Nudity No Language No
3196_4.txt,0, saw a great clip of this film which I'll talk about later and then the cast list and thought might as well give it a go . Basically a down bartender Randy Dillon his cocky cousin Carl Harding Reiser and murder investigation Detective Dehling Goodman all have something in common they have seen the girl of their dreams married or not and they would do anything to please and be with her even die . All three met her one night at McCool's'' the bar that Randy worked at they have no knowledge of each other but all three can not stop thinking of Femme Fetale Jewel Valentine Lord of the Rings Liv Tyler All three are telling their stories to someone they hope will listen to their pretty intense and revealing stories Randy talks to hit Mr. Burmeister Douglas who co the film Carl to psychologist Dr. Green McEntire and Dehling to priest Father Jimmy Jenkins They confess all details of what they have been willing to do their sexual contact with her and eventually they are all brought together in one place all intent on being with her and all involved with the final shootout that leaves one dead one running away eventually dying and one stunned and the unexpected guy she chooses at the same time obvious cos it's sex Douglas Also starring Andrew Dice Clay as Utah and Sandy Martin as Bingo Vendor Woman . If had to pick a favourite moment it would definitely be what was mentioned at number along with Cool Hand Luke on The Greatest Sexy Moments where Tyler copycats the woman washing the car with suds all over herself and in front of Goodman very sexy ! Apart from that not the most memorable film . Okay !
4851_4.txt,0, do not see what is the whole deal about this movie . Patricia Kaas sings yes and that makes the film charming but singing is not enough . mean if you want to get all benefits of this one go buy Patricia's CD and enjoy ! The plot is simple to omit the dreams'' the main characters seem to love each other instantly and as well instantly forget their other acquaintances . Relationships appear almost mandatory'' and the little detective story'' thrown in just makes things worse . What at first appeared to be a perfect movie ending is first screwed up and then comes out as just a dream . measure movies by how well would remember them and for this one already started to forget the details .
2686_4.txt,0, Obviously it seems many people really enjoyed this movie and that's wonderful . It is certainly a very well film and appreciate that in an era of heartless or emotionally damaging films . Unfortunately the film has a lot of problems and it was not something enjoyed watching . The primary problem is the writing . It is just not very funny . When something tries to be snappy or witty and fails that is far worse than when it has n't attempted wit at all . This film is to a great degree a series of snappy'' come between adult family members none of which seem imaginative or apt . There is also a few central premises in the film that seem like too much of a stretch of coincidence or character motivation to be believable or really work . Some of the back story seemed more intriguing and did serve to decorate the story around the edges fairly well but it could n't make up for the moment flatness that pervaded almost all of the movie . The directing does n't support the film well either although do n't know to explain how exactly . Somehow things always seemed to me rather fake and that the actors were forcing there way through unnatural material for the most part . They tried and do n't fault any one person here . There were also too many small and charmless roles in it outside the immediate family . Not a good rental in my opinion though again apparently a number of people found it very charming am suspect that perhaps people over might enjoy this film more ?

Tom is best friends with Jerry here which irked me a bit . The cartoon is also presented in Cinemascope . Overall found this Tom and Jerry cartoon sad and depressing . The should have just put Puss gets the boot'' on the DVD instead and would've been happy . This experimental animated short can be found on disc of Warner Brother's Spotlight Collection set . It's the last one on the set and I'm hoping that Warner Brothers chooses to release a second Volume soon . My Grade

Depression road tale hearkens back to yesterday with three escaped chain prisoners seeking a hidden fortune and inadvertently becoming country music stars in the process ! The film meanders along but never builds any momentum . It does get a big boost from Clooney's charismatic Gableesque mugging and also from the art direction and Burnett's lively music . Otherwise the screenplay the Coens is seriously lacking in humor and interest supporting cameos by John Goodman and Holly Hunter fail to add any lift and the second of the movie slides precariously into self from

Anyway this is the kind of international production featuring American and Italian actors and a British director which was prevalent during the it harmless and easy in itself but hardly memorable and definitely overlong especially since to procure finance for the heavy equipment required for the heist as an army tank and an airplane ! the gang involved have to pull a variety of minor thefts first . The gang of course is an incompetent lot led by an American Wagner and his bimbo girlfriend Welch the others are a black man a perennially hungry Italian and a diminutive Englishman . They try to induce an ex De Sica to turn over his fortune to them except he destitute under the auspices of Robinson he proposes instead a caper of million dollars worth of platinum ! Needless to say the gang members don trust one another instructs Welch to seduce De Sica so as to get the name of their fence in Morocco where they are to retreat after the robbery or else bungle the job to hold up a restaurant the Italian can resist sitting at table and order a multi meal for himself ! Amusingly in the face of similar failures De Sica tries to show them how they used to do it in the old days however ostensibly holding up a petrol station it transpires that the owner is a nephew of his and he merely asked to borrow some cash ! The central heist sequence is typically elaborate while the gang including Welch the train transporting the platinum Wagner kidnaps pilot Victor Spinetti and his airplane . When the job is done he fully intends to double De Sica but neither his partners nor Welch herself are willing to go along with this so he forced to relent . Coming from the time when crime didn pay the gang contrives to lose all their stash in mid when the plane bomb doors are accidentally opened
11271_4.txt,0, Director Kinji Fukasaku is perhaps best known in his homeland at least for his Japanese gangster films a series with which this movie shares a number of characteristics . Violence and political intrigue are themes throughout both Shogun's Samurai and Battles Without Honor and Humanity and both feature a lead character who finds his loyalties challenged by betrayals . Both films also feature a large number of characters who seem to have little purpose but to die and since so little is done to develop them their deaths have little impact when they do come . This film has other flaws as well . The makeup costumes and sound design are distractingly poor and the battle scenes were substandard as well inferior to other samurai films of earlier years Samurai comes to mind Sonny Chiba plays the Sonny Chiba character in Shogun's Samurai the no master swordsman who strides through the film scowling menacingly . What a guy he even gets to wear an eye patch . If you were expecting to see the legendary Toshiro Mifune you may be disappointed his appearance amounts to little more than a cameo and just when it appears that his character might do something interesting he disappears for good . Overall the strengths of the film are its story which is infinitely more comprehensible than those gangster films and the challenges posed to traditional concepts of good and evil . Two brothers are challenging for the throne of their recently departed father who may have had some help on his way out . Early on it looks as if we will be faced with a couple of characters who could n't be more clearly good and evil after all the older brother stammers and has a birthmark the sure sign of a villain . Eventually however it becomes clear that in a winner struggle for power there are no heroes and villains only winners and losers .
11090_4.txt,0, Julie Delpy stars in this horrific film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in France of the Century . The film attempts to shatter the romantic chivalry image of the heroic medieval knight by showing a rather dreary image of the period defined by psychological dysfunction and violence . The movie opens with a child Fran growing up in the shadow of the Hundred Years War told by his father to keep his mother safe and to wait for his return . Fran takes action when he discovers his mother with a lover in bed . Fran murders him in the name of defending his father's honour . Like father like son Fran grows up and leaves his family also to go to the same war . This setting is somewhat of an explanation for the events to come as on his way home we already notice that something is wrong with Fran The war has not done well with him he has changed . The daughter de Cortemart awaits her beloved father to return from captivity of the English . She is pure of heart and she was left to take care of the estate while her father was gone . In her father's absence needs to deal with financial difficulties which strengthens hope that her father will return to save her . But upon his return she notices that he lost the will to enjoy life and he tortures and humiliates everything around him even his own daughter . From this points the film depicts various ways how Fran torments his family . Starting with humiliating his own son and ending with the rape of his own daughter Setting the film in the Middle Ages supposed to soften the blow as the viewer may tell himself that these kind of violent acts were held in difficult times . And indeed many films on the topic of Incest such as Tim Roth's The War Zone which are contemporary were more shocking because of that . Delpy appears in this film in several daring nude scenes . Indeed she appears to be angelic and beautiful . was annoyed when saw some animal torture scenes . believe and this is not confirmed that some birds were killed for the making of this film which really upsets me . The quality of a film drops when real violence is used towards animals . would hope that this movie will be re without those cruelty scenes . Those scenes do not contribute much to the film storyline . Overall the movie is too long . The script is problematic . We do n't get to see Fran and before the war we do n't really get the answer why is he changed to such extreme . would have pass on this film however have to mention a few scenes that made this film worth watching Scenes of a young child being able to murder in cold blood is truly shocking . saw it first time on City of God Here Fran murders his mother's lover while his father away at war . Excellent scene and very graphic . The scenes from being raped by her father till she finds out she is pregnant from him are truly shocking and interesting . The scene after the rape where Delpy burns her cloths and cleans herself . She asks her brother to kick her in the stomach with hopes to have a miscarriage . The brother humiliation scenes where the father dumps his son's head into the food humiliating him then ranting about the war . Later dressing his son with women's cloths . The film won the Oscar for Best Costume Design agree the costumes here really make the film look authentic for the time period . The movie location is Ch de Puivert a real century castle and a historical monument located in Aude South France . Beautiful castle and mountain view really helps you set into the period of this film . The film also nominated for more awards but they were all snatched to the widely successful French film Au revoir les enfants'' Children'' Released as Beatrice'' in New York City March Only to be screened in France on November Watched it on YES on May at work .
11896_4.txt,0, In this follow up to The Naked Civil Servant we see the final years of Quentin Crisp's life in New York . John Hurt is again Crisp on who else could play the part ? and its a role he inhabits to the point of disappearing . For me Hurt is Crisp and I've always found it very hard to take the man himself because Hurt was more him than he was himself . Its masterful performance . His equal is Denis O'Hare as Phillip Steele Crisp's long time friend and confidant . Unfortunately outside of the performances the film has little to recommend it . To be certain the film gets the details right . Filmed in and around New York the film the film looks and feels like New York and its environs but dramatically its kind of inert . Its Crisp talking to people being witty to come to terms with the world as it is ended up regretting some poorly chosen words concerning AIDS and dealing with the infirmities that old aged thrust upon him . Quentin the man is always interesting but his life as portrayed is really not . am disappointed by the film . I've always admired the man and his unique point of view . just wish he was better served by this film about his life .
11329_4.txt,0, have only seen this movie once when was about years old but was thrilled that they made a movie about the Division . Being from Oklahoma and especially now that both of my sons are members of the would like to see it released on a DVD . may sound a little bias but the Division sometimes does not get the recognition it deserves today . The History channel always talks about the other infantry divisions when it talks about WW and Korea but you rarely hear it mention the One of the scene that really stood out for me was when the had the Indian Code Talkers at work and the puzzled look on the German soldiers faces when they could not understand this language . am glad that all of the Native American Code Talkers are getting the recognition they deserve .

The maestro must have rolled in his grave when this bawdy travesty of his work was released with its needless frontal nudity and cheap copulating and its portrayal of the naive but principalled Gilda as a horny ditz . Opera certainly can be adapted to cinema look at Zeferelli's magnificent La Traviata but when a work is as superb as Rigoletto it does n't need cheap gimmicks . It might even have been acceptable if the dubbed in music had been good but it is a mediocre rendering of the libretto with second rate sound quality at that .

This film was made during WW II and John Carradine was a German Nazi working to find a human weapon against the entire world . Bob Steele playing in many roles as a cowboy or gangster and in this picture Bob seemed bored to death with his role in this film and acted like this was his first film . Mantan Moreland gave an outstanding performance with great comedy which helped keep the audience attention . hate to criticize a film made in but this is really a big disappointment . If you like John Carradine and the roles he played as Count Dracula throughout many films during the you just might like to watch John doing his best .

In exchange for the fish they get western weapons which the mainly unemployed population eagerly awaits to use because being a soldier is their only source of income . So everything is all dark with trade as the incarnation of evil and source of all misery ? Not quite . Fortunately Darwin's Nightmare shows the dark sides only and completely spares the positive aspects . In fact the documentary hardly tells anything about the economic and ecologic importance the victoriaperch has for the region . For the countries around lake Victoria the victoriaperch is the second to third most important source of income . The wages in the fishing industry are way above average . Tanzania has banned huge trawlers to secure the jobs of thousands of fishermen . The adjacent states have met agreements to keep fishing on a sustainable level . Cities at the lake are benefiting from the taxes the fishers have to pay for each kilogram caught fish and the taxes on the factories exports and profits . Furthermore Tanzania has banned exporting the local traditional fish which still play an important role feeding the local population . By ignoring those positive signs the documentary deters the badly needed western consumers and investors and thus threatens to aggravate the African's situation . For further reading can recommend two articles the German alternative newspaper wrote on the subject http http

Once spotted the cassette knew had to have it . watched it that night . could tell it was going to be very cheesy and cheaply done . That's what drew me to it . popped it in and laughed the whole way through . recognized Gregory Ice Cream Man but did n't recognize his name and could n't remember where saw him . Later while watching the Andy Griffith Show Clint Howard Cream Man was featured as an extra since he is Ron Howard Taylor brother . saw the credits and gasped . turned to my mom who was also watching the show and said That's the Ice Cream Man ! She too gasped . This movie is great but only for laughs and criticalness . It is the perfect example of a cheesy horror flick .

Why make fun of people ? if what the inventors say is true and as most of them say they spent their life saving on the invention the minimum is to reject the idea without making fun out of the people . also it shows when they want to accept an idea by the crier that they added to the judges . The only one respect out of the judges is the one who always sits on the right of the table he is a respectable person of course the English snob who claims to be a business man wearing a suite does n't make you one pal last but not least the big guy who sits between the English and the crier . wake up man the is no job called and inventor for you to call yourself one . an inventor is an attribute not a job man . think they wanted to add someone like Simon from the American idol they thought it worked there it can work here as well . the context is different and the idea is totally different . it is a good idea and they could have done a good show out of it if they just change the judges and remove their act and attitude . just stop making fun of the people .
9992_4.txt,0, Some describe CALIGULIA as the'' most controversial film of its era . While this is debatable it is certainly one of the most embarrassing virtually every big name associated with the film made an effort to distance themselves from it . Author Gore Vidal actually sued mixed results to have his name removed from the film and when the stars saw the film their reactions varied from loudly voiced disgust to strategic silence . What they wanted of course was for it to go away . For a while it looked like it might . CALIGULA was a major box and critical flop Guccione had to rent theatres in order to get it screened at all and although the film was released on VHS to the home market so many censorship issues were raised that it was re and the edited version was the only one widely available for more than a decade . But now CALIGULIA is on DVD available in both edited and original Unrated'' versions . And no doubt John Gielgud is glad he did n't live to see it happen . The only way to describe CALIGULIA is to say it is something like DEEP THROAT meets David Lynch's DUNE by way of Fellini having an off day . Vidal's script fell into the hands of Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione who used Vidal's reputation to bankroll the project and lure the big name stars then threw out most of Vidal's script and brought in soft director Tinto Brass . Then when Guccione felt Brass work was n't explicit enough he and Giancarlo Lui photographed hardcore material on the sly . Viewers watching the edited version may wonder what all the fuss is about but those viewing the original cut will quickly realize that it leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination . There is a tremendous amount of nudity and that remains in the edited version but the original comes complete with XXX scenes there is very explicit gay lesbian and straight sex kinky sex and a grand orgy complete with dancing Roman guards thrown in for good measure . The film is also incredibly violent and bloody with rape torture and mutilation the order of the day . In one particularly disturbing scene a man is slowly stabbed to death a woman urinates on his corpse and his genitals are cut off and thrown to the dogs . In a documentary that accompanies the DVD release Guccione states he wanted the film to reflect the reality of pagan Rome . If so he missed the mark . We know very little about Caligula what little we know is questionable at best . That aside orgies and casual sex were not a commonplace of Roman society where adultery was an offense punishable by death . And certainly ancient Rome NEVER looked like the strange slightly Oriental oddly space sets and costumes offered by the designers . On the plus side those sets and costumes are often fantastically beautiful and although the cinematography is commonplace it at least does them justice the score is also very very good . The most successful member of the cast is Helen Mirren who manages to engage our interests and sympathies as the Empress Caesonia Gielgud and O'Toole also escape in reasonably good form . The same can not be said for McDowell but in justice to him he does n't have much to work with . The movie does possess a dark fascination but ultimately it is an oddity more interesting for its design and flat weirdness than for content . Some of the bodies on display McDowell's and Mirren's are extremely beautiful and some of the sex scenes work very well as pornography . but then again some of them are so distasteful they might drive you to abstinence and the bloody and grotesque nature of the film undercuts its eroticism . If you're up to it it is worth seeing once but once is likely to be enough . Gary Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer

Combs is surprisingly low keeping his performance at a more realistic level than we are used to seeing . Also gone is the usual Stuart Gordon black humor . The film is quite effective in showing Combs break down and his final heroic act to save his wife daughter . You actually feel sympathy for his character despite his short Personally was more surprised at the nudity and borderline porno sex scene than was shocked by the graphic violence gore . Not classic Gordon but certainly something you might enjoy if you've seen his more famous films .
4661_3.txt,0, Dear Readers I've found in my studies of movies that whenever Michael Bay makes a movie people pan it and hate it yet they still go to see it and it makes somewhere around million dollars . Why ? Because Michael Bay is one of the top five directors of all time . Standing alongside Ridley Scott Spielberg Kubrick and Miyazaki Michael Bay has cemented himself as Hollywood's best action director . That point is proved with his most panned film Armageddon . An Asteroid the size of Texas is hurtling towards the planet and the only way NASA can think to take it down is to land a team of men on the asteroid drill to its core and drop a nuclear warhead inside then blow up the asteroid . Only one person is qualified enough to do it Bruce Willis . Willis portrays Harry Stamper a grizzled hardened oil driller trying to keep what's left of his family together . Not helping that fact is his daughter Grace Tyler having an affair with his best driller AJ Affleck Hired by Dan Truman Bob Thornton the head of NASA Stamper and his team of roughneck drillers train to become astronauts and save the world . Armageddon is a two part movie . First there's the funny parts where we meet the gang and wackiness abounds . Then they get into space and all the comedy gets sucked out the window and is replaced by mind special effects cool music and great serious acting . Murphy's law goes insane in the second part meaning that everything that can go wrong does in fact go wrong increasing the tension of the film to outstanding levels . With a cool cast and crew Bay as Director Jerry Bruckheimer and Gale Anne Hurd as Producers and Abrams as one of the scriptwriters . tons of special effects great humor awesome music plus an intro done by Mr. Ben himself Charlton Heston Armageddon rocks big time . Signed The Constant DVD Collector Matt Macleod Parental Warnings This is not a film for kids . The is used a few times and lots of other swear words are used as well plus there's a Strip bar scene and the extremely intense second part might be too hard for a kid to handle .

Along the way he meets a young girl who is a thief and who ends up stealing something very important of Santa's wo n't tell you what that is you'll just have to watch the film for yourself Like most Ernest films there is a lot of slapstick humor involved . This film is probably one of Ernest's best films . It's funny and it has some important lessons to learn regarding friendship and family and not being afraid to show love . It's not the best Christmas film around but it is a good one to get you in the Christmas spirit . It's a little bit sad that the film is a little dated now .

Basically a bunch of lonely country boys take out a personals ad and find their town beset with willing female suitors suitors a gender word ? It ai n't progressive to be sure but it's sorta charming in its own right . Pity that the filmmakers felt the need to tack on a contrived subplot about a conniving golddigger and her violent husband . Overall it's just too cloying for its own good but you've got to give some props to a film with the guts to give a guy with Kevin Chamberlin's build a nude love scene . will always applaud the depiction of people who do n't meet the usual standards of beauty as sexual caring human beings but that's not enough to redeem Herman USA . To paraphrase Jello Biafra it's nostalgia for an age that never existed .

Movie is definitely for kids as the previous comments have it pretty right on . Coronado has gone through an overhaul in the past couple of years and many of the buildings seen in this film are now gone . The field where they are playing catch is adjacent to the football field one of the few areas still there . The internal scenes near the lockers believe were in the old building . Unless it is playing late at night on the Disney channel it may be a very hard to find flick . How they ever made sequels to this is beyond me .
10721_4.txt,0, As a big Jim Carey fan took my seat in the cinema with optimism . After all Fun With Dick And Jane appeared to have all the raw materials to make this another Carey success . After the opening five minutes of good humour it seemed that this film would provide but it went wrong as soon as the plot kicked in . The idea that a charming charismatic top employee could suddenly find himself turning up to work in his nearest supermarket is just so hard to believe and then to get your head round the fact that this guy has also become a master criminal is virtually impossible . The actors seem confused with the situation as well . Of course the stereotypical rich uncaring head of the operation does n't struggle one bit to pull off his one dimensional character but for Carey and others around him the job is a whole lot harder . One minute Dick is seen as a cocky office pro obsessed with possessions the next minute he's a bumbling mess who can barely string two words together and ultimately he becomes a petty thief who is able quite happily to put a gun to another man's head . Jane is equally confused with her role and her character never really gets going . The idea behind the story is such a good one and it is a shame that this film has not managed to make it work . The odd moment of laugh out loud comedy can be found but it is usually more physical humour than anything witty or clever . Carey tries his best in parts to save a sinking ship but his comic talent can never flourish in a character that has so many gaping holes to his personality . Carey shines when he is presented with a strong daring character on the Moon The Truman Show Ace Ventura which this film never presented him with despite its best efforts .

Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine are a newly married couple . He's the kind of lovable rogue'' character that you've seen in many films without ever being lovable as far as am concerned ! In fact it was a barely believable relationship at best and at times seemed particularly false and implausible . Unable to hold down a job and trying to live an opulent lifestyle Grant is led to borrow money that he can not pay back . Fontaine is convinced that he is trying to kill her in order to get the money she is insured for and presumably what her late father was worth . Average and rather uninteresting all round actually but as usual you can see the influence on films that have come at a later date .
7063_3.txt,0, No one is going to mistake THE SQUALL for a good movie but it sure is a memorable one . Once you've taken in Myrna Loy's performance as Nubi the hot gypsy girl you're not likely to forget the experience . When this film was made the exotically beautiful Miss Loy was still being cast as foreign vixens often Asian and usually sinister . She's certainly an eyeful here . It appears that her skin was darkened and her hair was curled . In most scenes she's barefoot and wearing little more than a skirt and a loose peasant blouse while in one scene she wears nothing but a patterned towel . suppose I'm focusing on Miss Loy's appearance because she is by far the best if not the only reason to tune in to this creaky antique and to keep watching . You sure wo n't be attracted by the dialogue which is hopeless . In one typical passage Nubi gazes out the window at the departing caravan and waxes poetic Always the gypsies they sing . Weird and sad . When the big sun have breath of fire that burn and when the pale moon look from behind cloud and breathe air cold as death they sing . Poetic or what ? Lovers of purple prose will have a field day . ca n't help but wonder though if in her later years Miss Loy preferred not to recall her involvement with this project . Like so many early talkies this one was an adaptation of a recent Broadway success . The stage version opened at the Street Theatre in November of and ran for over a year . The play provoked a famous episode involving the humorist and theater critic Robert Benchley who was known to have an aversion to characters who spoke in thick dialect or pidgin English . According to a much anecdote Mr. Benchley squirmed uncomfortably through the opening portion of this show . The Spanish village setting to a village in Hungary for the movie for some reason gave the actors leeway to practice their accents with varying degrees of success but Benchley's patience reached its limit when during a family dinner sequence a door burst open and an actress dressed as a gypsy girl dashed into the room shouting Help ! Help ! He keel me ! She then threw herself at the feet of the mistress of the household and exclaimed Me Nubi ! Me good girl ! Me stay here ! At that point Mr. Benchley rose and announced to his companion Me Bobby . Me bad boy . Me go now and left the theater . The film version offers numerous examples of unintended humor but never comes close to Benchley's level of wit . The melodramatic plot concerns the Lajos family father Josef mother Maria and son Paul a student at the nearby college . We would consider this prosperous family upper class'' as they are landowners with servants and all the comforts of life but their comfortable existence is abruptly thrown into turmoil when a gypsy caravan arrives in the village and their home is invaded by yes Nubi the nubile gypsy girl . She arrives at their door during the storm of the title symbolizing stormy emotions daresay . The girl is fleeing an abusive relationship and begs for sanctuary . After considering the matter the Lajos family agrees to hide her from her angry lover who shows up shortly afterward but is turned away . Nubi becomes a servant in the household . Kindness motivates the family's decision to take her in but soon enough that conniving little good Nubi has paid them back by seducing every able male in the vicinity starting with the Lajos servant Peter then working her way up to son Paul . Nubi breaks up Paul's relationship with his fianc Irma by Loretta Young still a teenager causes him to flunk out of school and then prompts him to buy her jewelry by stealing the savings of the family's maid Lena Pitts Lena for her part is still mourning the loss of her own fianc Peter seduced and tossed aside by Nubi when she turned her attentions to Paul . Ultimately Nubi sets her sights on the pater familias Josef and suppose if the running time had been longer she also would've gone after Uncle Dani Maria the village priest and God knows who else . guess it goes without saying that a scenario like this one easily lends itself to parody but during its first half THE SQUALL nonetheless exerts the undeniable fascination of a daytime soap we watch hypnotized as the Bad Girl works her spell on the men and wreaks havoc like an irresistible force of nature like a storm ! Ah another metaphor ! But as the plot machinations grind on the campy fun fades . During the later scenes Nubi is de and the focus switches to the dysfunctional dynamics of the Lajos family and after awhile these people get to be a real drag . The son in particular behaves like an absolute heel yet the parents never acknowledge this or face up to their own shortcomings everything we're told is the fault of Nubi that no tramp . The men of the cast are dull . Aside from Miss Loy the only actress who can handle performing in talkies is ZaSu Pitts terrific as usual . The mother of the Lajos household is played by Alice Joyce a longtime silent star who was out of her element with speaking roles and who retired soon after this . Loretta Young's fresh prettiness provides a nice contrast to Nubi's dusky allure but her line readings are so awkward it's kind of endearing . No there's only one reason to watch this flick and that's Nubi herself . ca n't think of another actress who could've played this silly role and managed to come off half as well . I'm not an objective observer however . have a desperate crush on Myrna Loy and will watch her in anything even THE SQUALL .

4294_2.txt,0, The Yoke's on Me'' is undoubtedly the most controversial film in the Stooges years of shorts . The reason is understandable by today's standards this film can be considered racist . For this reason it is rarely shown if ever on television . Let me just state that for the record the Japanese seen in the film were not soldiers they were Japanese sent to a relocation center during World War II . They were treated and shown as the evil enemy in this film . By all accounts including the US government who made an apology and reparations in the Japanese during World War II were as loyal and hardworking as any American . Their imprisonment during this time is a dark blot in American history . There are some Stooge laughs in this film but the memories of how Japanese were treated during this time sullies the entertainment value . Let's not confuse the loyal Japanese with their representation in this film as evildoers . Loyal Japanese and the World War II evil empire of Japan are not synonymous . out of

5678_2.txt,0, was a huge SNL'' fan back in the days of Chevy Chase John Belushi Dan Ackroyd Gilda Radner and many other memorable stars . But every time I've tried to watch it in the past more than ten years I've been very disappointed and sometimes even disgusted with it . Ten years ago believed the show could n't possibly survive since it had become so utterly bereft of the sort of humor could understand and yet it kept plugging along which I've always found dismaying wondering how in the world anyone could possibly find its lame humor at all funny . Whenever I've tuned in over the past decade I've never once been glad that did . Indeed I've always been annoyed at myself for staying up and wasting my time . For me the absolute low point came several years ago when a popular young male actor liked a lot was the guest host . At one point that night he played a big star perhaps himself and in the skit the character Mongo think played by Chris Kattan again think ended up in the backseat of a car with him . What followed was Mongo being forced up and down and up and down on the actor's lap with him screaming hysterically as he was presumably sodomized . The audience was laughing their heads off and I'm shaking my head amazed that they could find that remotely funny amazed that NBC would even broadcast such a thing . In the years since then I've repeatedly tried to approach the show with an open mind hoping that it might regain the sly sense of humor adored for so many years . But up until just a week ago for me it has n't done so . Not even close . One exception During the presidential campaign thought that Tina Fey was fantastic and she was the one performer who kept me tuning in . But those Sarah Palin skits while hysterical were still not enough to save the rest of the minutes and would always regret not turning it off as soon as heard the familiar It's Night !

Instead this movie is more about things not said and not expressed so it gets to the point where you are grateful anything is said at all even if the dialogue is not exactly quotable . SPOILER When the relationship that says the most is the one least seen on the screen and McEwan you know you're in trouble . But those two actresses are a very welcome sight in a movie screaming for some genuine people .

But her performance in this movie is disappointing . She was too old and the gauze filters on the lens make her look like a London fog refugee . She could n't sing and her voice was so froggy that she croaked through every song . Her dancing days were long in the past . Just because you are a Lucy fan do n't gloss over this mistaken sad performance and sing it's praises . prefer to remember Lucy in her wonderful TV series Love Lucy and to draw the curtain of charity over the terrible mess of a movie called Mame''

1752_3.txt,0, Some movies are not for everyone . This accurately describes Igmar Bergaman's movie Skammen At only still have what guess you could call a minor form of ADD and well watch movies to be entertained . Shame was a movie with a very interesting premise of trying to convey the effect of war on the common people it however fell short of accomplishing this for me . do n't know if it was the subtitles black and white filming length of the movie or the fact that it took two hours out of my studying for a huge chemistry test but did not enjoy it . understand it is considered a great movie and very important in the history of cinema however think as my teacher pointed out not everyone has liked or likes it . guess just wish it finished all of its many side plots . Maybe the translation lost something but felt there were infinite little off shoots that never met a conclusion . You would meet characters and never see them again or really understand why they were included in the movie . My overall recommendation for this movie is that it's worth seeing but only to form your own opinion on it . Whether or not you like or dislike it it is necessary to respect the point that it is trying to convey .

5036_4.txt,0, The brief existence of The Sex Pistols and the making of this film after the controversial groundbreaking English punk band's break both happened before was born . However started listening to their only album Never Mind the Here's the Sex Pistols'' in when was a teenager and quickly became a big fan . did n't see The Great Rock Roll Swindle'' until but saw it a couple times that year and thought it was pretty good not great but pretty good even if could only remember bits of it and did n't see how it all connected . Seeing it a third time nearly three years after the second did n't care much for it at all . I'm not even sure what found so good about most of it in the first place remember now This film is a mockumentary in which Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren tells his side of the story of the band and its members guitarist Steve Jones credited here as The Crook'' drummer Paul Cook credited as The Tea bassist Sid Vicious credited as The Gimmick'' and John Lydon Johnny Rotten credited as The Collaborator . McLaren claims that he created the band even the genre of punk rock as a scam to make money . He tells much of the story to Helen Wellington Helen of Troy in various places where they go together . It's basically a hodgepodge of McLaren talking Pistols songs live footage of the band fictional scenes silly strange ones several cartoon sequences etc . all put together in one film to tell the Pistols manager's side of the story in a bizarre way ! It has been well proved that McLaren is a liar know many have already pointed this out including band members themselves . He was NOT the driving force of the band he did n't create them did he invent punk rock and The Sex Pistols were n't even the first punk band though they were unique The band members were the ones who made the band what it was . The Filth and the Fury'' a much more believable film about the band from Julien Temple who made this film is told from the point of view of the band members who contradict McLaren's claims . However the dishonesty of The Great Rock Roll Swindle'' is not my biggest problem with it . If it were actually entertaining used to think it was to a certain extent would be able to overlook that like obviously used to be able to do . During my third viewing apart from Sex Pistols songs some live footage and at least one mildly amusing cartoon sequence it was pretty dull ! found the Who Killed Bambi'' song mildly amusing at first but it got tiring very quickly . Is this mockumentary worth watching for Sex Pistols fans ? It seems a good number of fans would say it is not to learn about the true story of the short but groundbreaking punk band but for entertainment . That was once my opinion on The Great Rock Roll Swindle'' After the first time watched it could n't remember a thing McLaren said and by the time saw it the second time was aware of what the Pistols manager was using this film to imply but could still barely remember anything heard him say ! Obviously other aspects of the film were what found impressive . Now after my third viewing can definitely remember some of the things McLaren says but it still was n't clear . Like most of the film guess his words are not that memorable probably because of the way they're presented . If you're a Pistols fan guess it would n't hurt to give Swindle'' a try but to me for the most part it's just an incoherent boring mess that tries to be funny but fails .
2972_2.txt,0, Hollywood has made a lot of strange movies over the years but none stranger than this . WHY this movie got made will never know nor how Paramount could have thought it would sell any tickets in It is the strangest mix of genres have seen in a long time a movie that truly does not know whether it is trying to be a serious war drama or a Viennese operetta comedy . It tells the story of a British spy trying to get a poison gas formula out of Germany in the days just before WW II began . Ray Milland a fine actor is stuck playing the part like an escapee from Monty Python all very exaggerated English prep dialogue . In Germany he meets a gypsy Marlene Dietrich who helps him to travel under cover as of course another gypsy . She plays her part like the typical Viennese operetta gypsy caricature as do the other gypsies'' in the movie . But there are also Nazis who are not funny at all . And then Milland finds he is starting to think like a gypsy and that is not treated as a joke . Sometimes the music is for a light comedy sometimes for a drama . Every time the Nazis show up the film score plays Wagner which is funny by itself . This movie could have been a comedy or it could have taken the plight of the gypsies seriously and done a serious job of showing how the Nazis treated them . Both are hinted at in this movie but neither pursued . What we are left with is a truly strange mish of genres that must have embarrassed everyone the director involved . Bizarre .
90_2.txt,0, The only reason this movie is not given a vote is that the acting of both Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan is superb . Ida Lupino who is lovely as usual becomes increasingly distraught as she tries various means to rid herself of a madman . Robert Ryan is terrifying as the menacing stranger whose character guided only by his disturbed mind changes from one minute to the next . Seemingly simple and docile suddenly he becomes clever and threatening . Ms. Lupino's character was in more danger from that house she lived in and her own stupidity than by anyone who came along . She could not manage to get out of her of her own house windows did n't open both front and back doors locked and unlocked from the inside with a key . You could not have designed a worse fire if you tried . She did not take the precaution of having even one extra key . Nor could she figure out how to summon help from nearby neighbors or get out of her own basement while she was locked in and out of sight of her captor . do n't know what war her husband was killed in but if it was World War II the furnishings in her house the styles of the clothes especially the children and the telephone company repairman's car are clearly anachronistic . recommend watching this movie just to see what oddities you can find .

So saw the glowing first review and decided to read more'' There found several reviews with or stars that summed up my feelings well about the lack of character development poor editing feeling that it was shot on the Universal back lot is long gone and overall impression that it was not going to come close to changing my feelings about LD . My impression is that the overwhelming vote of those who chose to write was less than a This got me to wondering about the process that yields a rating . If the people giving the and do not take the time to justify their vote is the ballot box being stuffed by people with a monetary motivation ? have long used IMDb as one tool to screen movies and thought it the best available . Now am not so sure .

Wagner has a personal interest in the project since his father was once the famed star's lover . Mysterious events unfold and Jackson must fight to save her husband from the spirit of the beautiful blonde who is perfectly preserved'' in a crypt on the estate moreover the evil woman seems bent on possessing her husband and murdering Jackson ! This is very much a Night of Dark Shadows'' variation co genuine Dark Shadows'' alumni Kate Jackson who knows and plays her part well . Robert Wagner lacks David Selby's intensity . Sylvia Sidney Mrs. Josephs sidesteps Grayson Hall . Marianna Hill is not a match for Lara Parker Diana Millay Bill Macy Oscar Payne is good in a part that would have been played by John Karlen a Dan Curtis production There are smooth cameos by Joan Blondell John Carradine and Dorothy Lamour . Ms. Lamour's delivery resembles Joan Bennett which begs the question why did n't producer Aaron Spelling get more of the original Dark Shadows'' regulars ? Director Swackhamer was Bridget Hanley's husband he worked with Ms. Blondell on Here Come the Brides'' and with Jackson on The Rookies'' Death at Love House'' has arguably a tighter storyline than the Night of Dark Shadows'' film it differs in the movie star angle and in its Father Eternal Fire'' ending it more closely resembles the TVseries Laura the Phoenix'' storyline .

8974_3.txt,0, Having some idle time before going to work looked at my Movie Pack Comedy Classics'' DVD collection and picked the most obscure title in the pack Zis Boom Bah starring a forgotten Grace Hayes . Classics'' is obviously the operative word here since most of the titles I've never heard of and suspect they're all in the public domain . Anyway this movie also stars her son Peter Lind and his wife Mary Healy just found out is a New Orleans native from the state live in Louisiana with Benny Rubin as a malt shop proprietor and Huntz Hall taking a break from the East Side Kids as Peter's buddy . The plot about a vaudeville mother trying to turn her rich carefree son into a responsible one with him unaware of who she is is for the birds and does n't have many funny scenes though did like Peter's celebrity impersonations and his dance with Hall in drag . And the songs and dances are entertaining in themselves . Rubin however is all over the place with his confusion of the American vernacular of the time and almost everything concerning him makes no sense whatsoever did like his funny dance Since this was only minutes that I'm sure played on the lower of the double feature bill I'll be charitable and give this one a for the few entertaining bits that mentioned enjoying .

3646_1.txt,0, Well there's a few things about this movie . Everyone should see it . You see the nation of Iraq like you've never seen it covered by the media and shot from a perspective that is hardly considered by most Americans where the movie has its main audience . However all that glorious stuff in mind lets take a look at a few other facts of the movie . There were cameras handed out to the Iraqi people most all of which view the war and subjugation of the occupying forces as a growing pain for the bettering of their nation . And in comparison to Saddam it is simply a feeble scratching at the skin . Also Netflix as its main distributor advertised it before the fun election we just had by sending out a mass to its entire roster to see the film . Many of the what should be labeled as opinions played out as facts listed off by the interviewed Iraqis are wrong . If one is to review the Red Cross records of Abu Ghraib tortures it was n't Saddam's henchmen who were being tortured it was a fine mix of a innocent civilians and rightfully detained people . Never was it disclosed that any of that were Saddam's Henchmen or curfew violators . In addition the Arab world really has never listed as one of their opponents more correctly it is the USA's Billion Dollars a year to Isreal our military bases in Saudi Arabia and our interest in Oil . agree that the media is a complete distortion but this film shows that same distortion . I'm afraid that the Iraqi people that this film represents have been edited to speak with a Yankee voice . Yes its true that Saddam is a puke and that his removal many see for the best . Its true that some Iraqis actually get paid a good wage . Just as its true that no Iraqi people have control of their most prized oil and US corporations do . Nor does it mention that civilians have died due exclusively to US artillery . Still of the country which once had running water and electiricity now does not . Nor does it mention that from UN sanctions purposed and authored by the USA Government killed over Iraqi civilians . Nor does it mention that Democracy in when people decide the government not a massive war machine that sends the message killed or Obey am afraid that the cutting room floor must have quite a bit of Iraqis that are n't so happy with the Occupation . Just as the vast majority of the world was not for the war . In fact the America Britian Spain and the rest of them are not carriers of Democracy they turned their back to it when they saw how full their pockets could be . Hurray Saddam is out of power but I'm afraid that no Iraqi is yet in power . Corporations are in power the media is in power . Read do your own research and do n't let them blindfold you .
12226_4.txt,0, Back in when Matthew Lawrence did The Hot Chick also saw Drumline that day . Drumline wins by default ! If The Comebcaks had been released in March planned the same time TMNT was released TMNT would've won by default ! Granted Matthew Lawrence did a fine job portraying a quarterback . He did n't have to resort to uttering dirty words which is a plus . But when he started playing with his private parts as well as another football players and touching a girl's boob those were the minuses . But the biggest minus that ticked me off is that every football player got to participate in the mock music video except Matthew Lawrence The Price Is Right's losing horns Another blown musical opportunity for him just because he's shy about doing music . In the past Matt has disappointed me many times Human Samurai Syber Squad where he came so close to having a musical moment but ended up failing . Sure Joey had a singing career with two albums to his belt and Andrew's starting a music career of his own . But it's very rare to find a Matt musical moment . The two that stand out would be on Brotherly Love where he played the guitar and sang Pigeon On Your Car'' Atrack which he wrote by the way and that romantic Boy Meets World moment when he sang This Dame'' Time Goes By Matt you've played jocks too long . Why not make a musical comeback . You have a good voice and miss your musical side .
983_4.txt,0, This movie would have been alright indeed probably excellent if the directors would have left the interviews and the concert footage separate . Into the Void'' is a great song and hate how it is cut off at the best part to go to an mumbling interview with Ozzy Osbourne . That should have been at the end of the film or located in a special feature . The best part of concert DVDs is to put them on and let the music play but Black Sabbath The Last Supper'' is hard to put and and simply let play because the music is continually interrupted . Nevertheless there are a few strengths to this film the concert footage when it does play it excellent . Black Sabbath returns to the stage after a long hiatus without Osbourne and this film captures that well Sabbath basically rocks the fans . The fans of course have a sweet advantage in the film because they are seeing the band live of course but also they do not have to put up with the incessant interviews that the DVD viewers are burdened with . Shame on Jeb Brien and Monica Hardiman directors for doing this to the film ! Also shame on Wyatt Smith for editing the film in such a way .

But the movie comes the life in the third act when Ernest joins the party . He is so lively and fun in truth probably wears more makeup then Lady Greyston He gets the last line of the film and it's a gas !

2196_1.txt,0, as a new resolution for this year decide to write a comment for each movie saw in theater or in DVD must admit that DVD have revolutionized this habit . For instance can hear the true voice of the cast which is an essential trait of the personality . In my country non french movies are dubbed and we end up with aberrations french voice is terrible very far away of its original tone the same voice for different people or a same people with different voices And well if everybody found my comments unuseful well in will stop my reviews . Ah So enjoy them now My summary means that the story locations cast is not very enjoyable . Only . Sandra bullock is there . She is a talented actress able to get the viewer to catch on the movie . It reminds of a feminine the fugitive'' So if you look for a moment of escaping your life watching this movie makes it worse because Sandra's life is a mess . She got nothing left to hold on to only her poor mother is Alzheimer ill again the touch for depression In fact she has a sad life in the beginning of the movie has a sadder life throughout it to finally get back to it at the end . what a happy ending maybe the writers wanted to make a point about a nerd's life . very far away from the best computer movie of all time
2176_4.txt,0, Adenoid Hynkel a lowly soldier in World War One rises in subsequent years to become the ruthless dictator of Toumania . He creates an aggressive antisemitic war machine and cultivates a little toothbrush moustache . Sound like anyone you know ? From the safety of Hollywood Chaplin uses this soapbox to exhort Europe to take up arms and defy Hitler and Mussolini . Given that the United States in had more than a year of neutrality ahead of it and no strong desire to embroil itself in Europe's civil strife it was Hitler who declared war on the USA not the other way round it is surprising that Chaplin was allowed to distribute this immoderate polemic . The story involves on the one hand the the vulgar and repellant Hynkel and the reign of terror over which he ineptly presides and life in the jewish ghetto where every single person is friendly humane brave etc . etc Chaplin is Hynkel and he also plays The Jewish Barber the little hero of the ghetto Tramp in all but name Needless to say Chaplin writes directs stars composes the music and does the catering . In the full truth was not yet known about the Third Reich and Chaplin can be forgiven for having something less than perfect historical foresight but even by the standards of the day he gets Hitler badly wrong . comedian and a sentimentalist Chaplin tries to ridicule Hitler by making Hynkel silly and hapless . All this does is to humanise him . When Hynkel the not soldier fools around with the big gun and the upside aeroplane he becomes endearing rather than despicable . As dictator he inspects his subordinates technical innovations which do n't work parachute hat the bulletproof uniform etc . and these passages are meant to make us think that the real Nazis are incompetent and can be swept aside . In fact Hynkel's regime is made cute and likeable by its bumbling bodgery . In truth Chaplin's day had already passed when he made this ill polemic . At heart he was still a dinosaur of the silent screen out the humour with gags like staggering up and down the street semi or the pantomime of the coins in the puddings The hero Schultz is meant to represent a yardstick of European decency against which Hynkel can be judged but Schultz looks more like a character from operetta than a Nazi . Is it in any way believable that a Schultz figure such had existed would say to the Fuehrer's face your cause is doomed to failure because it's built upon the stupid ruthless persecution of innocent people'' And how does Schultz come to be in the cellars of the jewish ghetto ? If he is the object of an exhaustive manhunt why does he persist in wearing his Ruritanian uniform ? Chaplin did not yet know the full horrors of Auschwitz or Treblinka but the Nazi concentration camp which he offers us is hopelessly out of kilter with the grim spirit of the age . As usual Chaplin thinks in terms of comedy set loosely pegged onto the narrative clothes line . There is the knockabout scrapping with the stormtroopers shaving a man to the accompaniment of Brahms and the globe ballet for the segment filmed in reverse Paulette Goddard is the unremittingly perfect Hannah . Just as the people of the ghetto are impossibly nice and the jewish haven in Osterlich is ridiculously idyllic so Hannah is quite literally too good to be true . Brave defiant resourceful hardworking and course beautiful she is the canary of judaism in the ghetto cage . Gee ai n't cute ? she asks after the Barber gives her a make Too cute by far is the answer . She does n't come close to ringing true because Chaplin has made her a caricature . The it be wonderful ? speech which Chaplin puts into her mouth is typical of the author too wordy too emotionally cloying . Jack Oakie is great as Napaloni the fascist dictator of Bacteria . He brings a whiff of much comic brio to the proceedings but the film's underlying weakness remains . If Napaloni is silly and ineffective how can we fear him ? And anyway the stuttering stop of the back train is a fine Chaplinesque example of a gag that is persisted with far beyond its comic worth . And where did the Jewish Barber acquire that immaculate Hynkel uniform ?

496_3.txt,0, Here is another great film critics will love . The problem is that it is not a very good movie . The films premise is simple . Nine convicts escape a prison after the tenth one goes crazy and tells them where the treasure is . The first half has a lot of slapstick some of it very broad while the second half is a character driven descent into fantasy and melancholy . The two halves simply do n't mix . Individual scenes do work very well guys crashing a friends house who has a new Filipino bride is hilarious While a later scene with the big guy working in the restaurant tugs at the heartstrings . They simply do n't mesh with each other . The movie as well is missing entire set One scene shows the guys desperately looking for change under a deserted vending machine to buy a snack . The very next scene has the whole crew in drag sitting down in a restaurant . Where did they get the dresses and wigs ? crew includes both the big guy and a midget How did they get all the clothes and money to buy the meal ? And most puzzling is why are they in drag ? They are clearly guys in drag and lets face it is there anything more memorable to witnesses than a big guy and a dwarf eating a meal dressed as women ? mention the big guy and the dwarf because besides the old guy everyone else seems to blend into each other . fact they wear matching white jumpsuits throughout most of the movie The movie has very little character development in the first half and as a result the second half really lacks an emotional punch . As we are often trying to figure out who is who in their individual payoff scenes . Speaking of a drag the second half has all those wonderful sweeping camera shots and big emotional moments and great symbolism that makes a great film . It is also excruciatingly slow which makes for a boring movie . Souls is a big disappointment the reviews gush about a great film and it's in there somewhere good luck finding it yourself .

While like Jamie Denton this show is hardly worth watching at all unless you enjoy watching some people brutalized and the actions of the agents supposedly warranted under the theme of national security . The show is great propaganda for the current government and spews out jingoism as though we talk that way every day . After a couple of episodes it was boring the hell out of me and started watching reruns of House Invaders on BBCAmerica instead . Rather watch CSI and Without a Trace without a doubt .

6768_4.txt,0, was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine . The gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me and could see why people would have been afraid of someone like Dillinger . Seeing it as an adult it seemed almost comical owing to the overdone narration and jarring details like Thirties gangsters driving cars that looked like they were from the Fifties . There is a certain gritty unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera . The most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where Ma Barker and her sons are shooting it out with the FBI and the sons are killed . The narrator says something like Perhaps in that moment for the only time in her life Ma Barker became a real mother'' This is meant to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos as Ma finally realizes how she's destroyed her family out of her own greed but instead it provokes laughter . very odd film that is rarely shown anywhere these days . Gangster movie buffs might enjoy it but more as a curiosity than a real movie .
8854_3.txt,0, This film is about a gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead . There's a lot of mumbo about the internet if you install a program on the computer you see dead folks like if you play a videotape you'll die in RINGU Frankly most of this seemed rather silly and lost me . What did find interesting is the idea that the dead live within their own separate existence totally alone for eternity . This was sobering and fascinating . love Japanese films and have seen a huge number compared to most Americans . However one genre that has become popular in recent years that just ca n't relate to very well are these horror films . know they are super popular since they seem to be remade so often in the States . I've seen both RINGU as well as THE RING JU and THE GRUDGE and was rather ambivalent despite their popularity . About the only recent horror film really liked from Japan was SEANCE reworking of the great British film SEANCE ON WET AFTERNOON . And what do think made SEANCE different ? Well unlike the other films as well as KAIRO gobs and gobs of money were n't spent on special effects or trying to scare the audience the emphasis was on the story . The bottom line is that these other films are a lot like American films like HALLOWEEN or Friday scary things jumping out just to scare the audience and plot is purely secondary best For me want story cheap thrills or ghosts as the primary focus of the film . With a relatively high rating know am in the minority but just do n't find this a very satisfying film . All too often minor things occur that might startle someone slightly the characters begin screaming and crying and acting as if to say this is the scariest film ever made so you'd better start shaking'' Well think it just tries too hard and wish it had focused more on the afterlife seen at the end of the film and plot progression scare tactics .
9150_4.txt,0, Yes it's true that it was Jessica Alba who leads me to this movie because without her should have never pick it . But find it long dull and above all unoriginal . All along thought that the story was full of clich and the directing very boring . So it was a surprise to see that the director and writer are the one and same person . take notice to remember to avoid all his next movies . It's a pity because all good things were at hand Malaysia is a beautiful jungle it was the British Empire and the cast is wonderful Jessica knows how to open her soul and for one time she has found an appropriate movie for this . Bob Hoskins shows a great experience and he should have won an award for this role .

5929_4.txt,0, Purportedly this is the final film of the Left Behind series which is fundamentalist preacher and novelist Tim LaHaye's idea of what we can expect in our future in the final days of Planet Earth . If this is the case we can expect an activist presidency in every sense of the word if Barack Obama becomes president next year . The Fantastic Four of Revelation are all back with one cast change Arnold Pinnock who most would know as the guidance counselor in Life With Derek is now the minister taking the place of Clarence Gilyard . Brad Johnson as the anti pilot by day and Christian by night is there as his daughter Janaya Stephens and ace investigative reporter Kirk Cameron . These are the only four people on Earth who have divined the true nature of UN Secretary General Nicolai Karpathy and once again are throwing sand in his machinery . This time they've got as an ally the President of the United States who is played by Louis Gossett Jr . He's having one hell of a rough time especially the guerrillas launch on RPG attack on a presidential motorcade killing Vice President Charles Martin Smith . That's right the Toad is Vice President . Somebody really messed up bad here because everyone including those who would do them harm know a President and Vice President NEVER travel together . It takes all of them the entire film to convince Gossett exactly who Karpathy really is . Once again the best one in the film is Gordon Currie as Karpathy . We may yet see another Left Behind film yet the door was left open though people assure me that they've run out of source material from Tim LeHaye . suppose as long as they make money and these players ca n't get jobs in the mainstream film industry . And there are some unresolved plot issues involving Brad Johnson and Chelsea Noble who is Mrs. Kirk Cameron in real life . One of the Fantastic Four does die in this film so will it be the Fantastic Three or will they get another fourth . Stay tuned .

This massive musical is so peculiar and over blown over produced and must have caused ruptures at Paramount in It cost million dollars ! That is simply irresponsible . DARLING LILI must have been greenlit from a board meeting that said hey we got that Pink Panther guy and that Sound Of Music gal . lets get this too'' and handed over a blank cheque . The result is a hybrid of GIGI ZEPPELIN HALF SIXPENCE some MGM song and dance numbers of a style and boaters ! so hopelessly old fashioned as to be like musical porridge and MATA HARI dramatics . The production is colossal lush breathtaking to view but the rest the ridiculous romance Julie looking befuddled Hudson already dead the mistimed comedy and the astoundingly boring songs deaden this spectacular film into being irritating . LILI is like a twee mega musical with some vulgar bits to spice it up . STAR ! released the year before sadly crashed and now is being finally appreciated for the excellent film is genuinely is . and Andrews looks sublime mature especially in the last half hour . LILI is POPPINS and DOLLY frilly and believe really killed off the mega musical binge of the and made Andrews look like Poppins again . which believe was not Edwards intention . Paramount must have collectively fainted when they saw this and with another million festering in CATCH and million in ON CLEAR DAY and million in PAINT YOUR WAGON . had a financial abyss of CLEOPATRA proportions with million tied into films with very uncertain futures . Maybe they should have asked seer Daisy Gamble from ON CLEAR DAY was very popular on immediate first release in Australia and ran in cinemas for months but it failed once out in the subs and the sticks and only ever surfaced after that on one night stands with ON CLEAR DAY as a Sunday night double . Thank god Paramount had their simple ONE MILLION DOLLAR film LOVE STORY and that million dollar gangster pic THE GODFATHER also ready to recover all the million in just the next two years . just incredible !
4602_4.txt,0, Clearly this film was made for a newer generation that may or may not have had an inkling of Charles Bukowski's work . The autobiographical Henry Chinaski character in Bukowski's stories was brilliantly portrayed to perfection by Mickey Rourke in also starring Faye Dunaway . Anyone who has seen should certainly see to get a better look at how Bukowski wrote his character . lacks the greasy seediness of Bukowski's screenplay and the fearless hopelessness of his loner hero . The inadvertent humor that bubbles through in the dark desperation of Chinaski's misadventures does n't work for Dillon as it did so admirably for the overweight filthy blood Rourke . Rourke's character makes the pain and pleasure of the previous night's misbehavior a place for yet another grueling ugly day in the life of a drunken misanthropic unknown writer . Dillon's character misses these marks in favor of a strutting handsome relatively clean wan na writer that scarcely passes for any moment in that of Chinaski's story . Dunaway's sleazy heroine Wanda is the perfect complement to the ne'er Henry . The women in ca n't hold a candle to Dunaway's goddess and the use of more profane sexual subject matter in proves to be more of a crude distraction than a tip of the hat to Bukowski's raw and unapologetic portrayals of dysfunctional relationships . was stunned at how many of the exact same scenes were used in Tomei buying all the stuff and charging it to the old man is an exact rip from If you want to see the best Bukowski stories on film see and is a Dog From Hell also goes by the title Love
12493_4.txt,0, Yet another version of mother of all gangster flicks Classic Godfather'' and yet another case of over due to media circus . Sarkar the Hindi film of Ram Gopal Varma as director is also the weakest in his Underworld trilogy including the other two being the excellent and Company . The Charisma the magnetic persona of the two Bachchans playing father duo on screen for the first time is definitely a treat to watch out for . Not just strong performances but their perfect chemistry is the biggest scoring point here for which Varma should be applauded . However the same equation of the duo is missing with the other characters in the film . Reason other characters look more like cardboard caricatures esp . the villains represent the typical Bollywood baddies . character who attracts attention is elder son played by Kaykay but again not able to hold due to half characterization . The Drama and conflict is brought alive by the excessive use of Close which brought a claustrophobic effect rightly needed to construct an ambiance . The haunting Score Mohile and the sound design Mehta Parikshit Lalwani Anup Dev together with dark murky background overlapped by shinning powerful images by Amit Roy contributes to Visuals so typical of Ramu's style . But there is an overuse of Music though fortunately no songs are there in the film . But can interest of today's intelligently growing'' audience be sustained just on shoulders of two performers and strong Visuals do n't think so . Surely audience maangey more'' and here film fails to deliver . In any adaptation in order to add a new dimension the biggest pre is the Screenplay which is sluggish here not being crisp at places and therefore the pace slackens quite often . What finally audience is subjected to is a highly predictable very commonplace drama with very little surprise elements . Top Stunt director Allan Amin Ghani is also not in his best form . Some scenes which require a different treatment includes a Minister is talking foul about Sarkar and the son is overhearing a very amateurish shoot out in the jail on Sarkar Sarkar Jr. escapes from the clutches of his enemies a Son easily motivated to kill his own father a son is secretly entering his father's room to kill him a police commissioner slapping Sarkar Jr this requires a more realistic hard approach which is the back to create the required conflict . The dialogues are weak for eg . look at an amateurish line where a CM says to Sarkar Jr. jo Police Commissioner tha na usay maine hata diya'' The women folk take on Sarkar's working is completely ignored . The uninterrupted negotiations about criminal activities while Sarkar is with his family also look slightly out of place In fact the film follows a graph quite similar to Ramu's own production Tak Chhappan . In depicting the battle between good and evil the other side of life law police administration politics is completely ignored . Certainly more is expected in content . Here the film definitely falls short and could not rise above an average fare . Dear Ramu agreed that now you are laughing your way to the bank you definitely need to take some drastic overhauling measures in your film production factory before it is too late .
10419_4.txt,0, Yesterday'' as a movie is hard to rate . The cinematography is excellent and deserves a The story is gritty and real and does not compromise . But the translation of the story to the screen through the actors did not match the camera work . As a person who was born and raised in Central Africa appreciated the authenticity of the film's look and the honest depiction of daily life for the Zulu . But this and the camera work are not enough to recommend the average viewer should see this film . It takes an appreciation of true cinema and not just a love of movies to see the purpose and strength of Yesterday'' Unlike the film The Gods Must be Crazy'' which was a comic look at one African culture encountering modern technology Yesterday'' has no intention of appealing to any crossover audience . The movie simply is not fit for the common western mind and doubt it was intended for the western mind . The scenes are long and slow the editing is not paced for a instant gratification world . The dialog is not cleaver or witty it is real . Movies about health crises do not make the best entertainment and this movie is not entertainment it is education . This movie is best viewed by those who know appreciate and love the way of life and the culture in sub Africa . If you lack a broad enough world to understand other cultures especially African cultures should skip this film . Do not waste you time with it . Go see Talladega Nights'' or Larry the Cable Guy'' instead for your cross culture viewing . give it a for most who might want to see the movie but have no accurate understanding of African cultures . For the viewers with an appreciation for films about the human experience anywhere in the world would give it a

5197_4.txt,0, feel conflicted about this film it is one of the most beautiful films I've seen and provides insightful looks into a lost culture . There was an early scene of men in caps and moustaches sitting around a table with a woman serving and an accordion playing that brought tears to my eyes just because of the way it captured a way of life that must be incomprehensible to many today . It presents the lives of the characters as being inextricably bound up with the life of the village another lost concept in today's world . Symbolism is always fun but it seemed a little dated . The fatal flaws of the movie to me were the lack of any compelling dramatic drive and a total lack of humor . never felt like knew any of the characters beyond very basic universal things like grieving over the loss of a loved one etc . The people were stick figures in the director's tableaux involving natural disasters war etc . The film was just one beautiful tragic scene after another with no involving narrative thread and no humanity . As a result it seemed very abstract irrelevant to the lives of real people . In the end was too bored to finish watching it .

What a story this company troop has . people to come and see there movies on street corners anywhere they can and all for free and after all that to develop a great fan base after a few years THEY CRAP ON IT And decide to close down there website that helped them and was created for the fans but the worst thing about it . DID N'T TELL ANY OF THEM . They just decided that they are better than us they want new fans not the fans that helped them get where they are . know the same fans they begged years ago . Still the smart crew they are they released the best movie with Super Troopers and got everyones attention and thank God for that because after that they have sucked with everything else . Good for you guys way to go mainstream just remember when you realize your material is n't that good and you have no new fans left you are the ones who crapped the original ones away .

4444_2.txt,0, Altman's Quintet has to be considered more than just flawed As so many other reviewers have pointed out the ideas behind the film even some of the choices in depicting those ideas ought to work yet very little in this difficult film does . The partially fogged camera lens remarked to my wife that it has to be the most distracting directorial conceit I've ever seen allowed me to get into'' the film's world . In general there are serious problems with the mise employed here . It's clear that no small amount of thought went into factors like costume and production design but neither is very effective in evoking a believable world . Perhaps it is a matter of scale the film is so stage that laughed out loud once it was mentioned that five million'' people lived in the city . understand the constraints of the film's budget . Matte paintings here and there might have helped . In all the most disappointing Altman film I've ever seen .

Maybe as she herself graps on to the end of her musical career her condtion of desperatation lands her in role that she flaunts re and triumps as her own . Bette's singing is always belted always flat and lacking to show her ability as an actress . To be entertaining this performance was dying for a stronger lead and a stronger cast so that the others would be memorable in Bette's absence . Another criticism she smiles directly into the camera every time she start singing ! know it is musical theater but please leave some grace sociale Middler can not perform like Liza or Streisand might in a retrospective tour out of character and out of context .
10137_2.txt,0, My parents may enjoy this show but fail to find the humor in it . What is so funny about a dentist husband impregnating his hygienist assistant and the oldest daughter getting impregnated by the captain of the high school football team ? Absolutely nothing ! It's a shock to me sometimes what people think constitutes humor nowadays . Blame that on shows like The Dating Game'' and The Newlywed Game'' bringing the issue of sex to the forefront in the mid Sure the series has its touching moments still that's no excuse for the content that otherwise went into this series . This is nothing like the family days of Love Lucy'' some five decades before . An answer would have to why this series plays on the Lifetime cable channel is because that channel's brass think women can relate to Reba's character ! absolutely dislike the character of Reba Hart's daughter Kyra . She is best described as a ditsy and bitter teenager ! Funny wonder if the actress who played Kyra Scarlett Pomers is like that in real life away from acting . Who plays the blockhead ex dentist Christopher Rich is not much better . Barbara Jean played by Melissa Peterman is ditsy in herself ! The characters of Van and Cheyenne are also very annoying . Something else that baffles me is why the dingbat creator Allison Gibson decided to set the series in where live miles away from Houston Texas ! Reba McEntire is n't even from this state she's an Oklahoman ! Why is it during one season or more they decided to make the incidental music sound like a pig snorting ? What mean by that is where we hear this baritone saxophone being played with drums accompanying it but the melodies are basically tuneless !

But since saw and did the work the guys on that TV have to do have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long . That really is no easy work . And also the actors which in your eyes may be terribly bad are really great people and a lot of them really can act ! do n't think that the material given to them can really show that as think this material is n't very good . But THEY are truly good ! So do n't think that you before you have n't seen these guys doing there work can judge over them ! And should n't have judged over them as well before met them but did and am now terribly ashamed of it .

10784_4.txt,0, The bearings of western Feminism on the various subcultures of India have hitherto remained largely non the two entities belonging to alien realms and threatening the name of tradition never to coincide . Art imitates life so the claim goes and popular Hindi cinema is no exception reflecting an underlying misogyny which regrettably forms the foundation of much of the collective Indian culture . But why ? What is it about the female gender that has rendered it so hateful to the culture that women are routinely subject to the most unimaginable horrors including rape murder infanticide imposed illiteracy infidelity and the subjugation of spirit that goes under the name of Rajkumar Santoshi's latest offering Lajja'' asks the same plaintive question linking the atrocities committed against women through three separate chapters which comprise the journey of shame endured by its protagonist Vaidehi Koirala Direction on Santoshi's part is not up to par with the level the story demands . He fails to achieve the necessary sensitivity in depicting the saga of sadness and confronts the issue of misogyny from the side instead of head Santoshi has recently said that he did not make the film for an international film festival but rather for the masses of his country . Regrettably the tackiness shows and the film too often delves into the action genre that Santoshi specializes in . The film suffers from its jerky episodic pace and its ending is rather too contrived . The female cast is given much kinder and more rounded characterizations than their male counterparts . The protagonist is played sensitively by the luminescently beautiful Manisha Koirala who proves in Lajja that she is one of our time's more competent leading ladies and given a proper role and set up emerges with a truly commendable performance . One wonders how brilliantly she may have shone had the film been made by a director with the appropriate creative intention and appreciation of the issue at hand . Mahima Choudhary puts in a laudable performance and continues to show that she is an untapped talent . Cast as Janki Madhuri Dixit performs with a never fervor and felicity for what truly deserves the name of The role of a street smart performer who finds solace in alcohol and the promise of an unborn child stands as the greatest risk in her cannon of song roles which have maintained her marquee status over the past decade . Which leaves the final and most disturbing performance in this would feminist saga that of the ceaselessly talented Rekha . Lajja is Manisha Koirala's film there can be no doubt about that but it is Rekha who dominates the proceedings in a performance that digs into your bones and sends echoes of terror through the vestibules of your heart . Rekha dazzles as Ramdulari foregoing vanity and complacency to deliver a performance that is so replete with authenticity and ingenuity that emotional nudity becomes the mantra of this portion of the film . Comparisons are indeed odious especially when rendered opposite one of the world's great leading ladies but in the gracious presence of this reigning screen legend the others fade in her shadow . Lajja'' has none of the sophistication of proto dramas like Zubeidaa'' Pinjar'' or even the Hell celebration Laadla'' it fulfills its feministic goals in two early moments loud tirade in which Mahima berates her in for their abuse of her father who has committed no other crime than given birth to a girl . She erupts leaving the wedding procession in shambles . Seeing her father devastated she begins to weep blaming herself for the chaotic destruction in front of her . She bemoans Why did say anything ? have ruined everything ! It is all my fault ! Her grandmother witnessing silently the abuse she bore comforts her by saying Why are you crying ? There is no reason for you to be crying . You are not at fault for anything . The fault is mine . The fault is of every woman who came before you because if we had had the courage to say in our day what you have said today there would have been no need for you to say anything today . In this scene the importance of the Feminist Legacy is laid plainly in sight through words . The other more subtle moment comes very early in the film when Vaidehi has fled from her abusive husband to the refuge of her parents home in India . To viewers of western societies it may seem perfectly reasonable natural that any abused woman would seek the protective guardianship of her parents this however is a societal taboo in many eastern cultures India among them . Once a woman has been married the identity she assumes is that of her husband and his personal assets business children etc . For her to turn her back on these responsibilities is a grave social sin one which truly has no equivalent for the western woman . She is thereafter regarded as tainted and as goods one whose value has been nullified entirely by her own actions and her refusal to submit to the role she has been given . She is not so much an individual as she is an emblem of familial honor . Her father rebukes her for her actions concerned that his familial honor will be tarnished irreparably by the daughter he had already transferred to another man . His primary concern is that of the impending marriage of Vaidehi's younger sister a prospect made far less likely with a divorced elder daughter in the same household . He tells her in no uncertain that she must return to the man to whom she lawfully belongs however violent and sadistic he may be . He levies against her the age old adage that The honor of every home lies in the hands of its daughter . Quietly and pensively she replies Yes the honor of every home lies in the hands of its daughter . But there is no honor for the daughter herself .
7181_4.txt,0, If this is the best Commander Hamilton movie have no curiosity about the others . movie actor's greatest tools are his eyes but when Peter Stormare wants to show great emotion he closes his so for five or six seconds we get to admire his eyelids while his feelings remain unknown behind them . Lousy acting technique . Stormare also flinches sometimes when he fires a gun turning his head away and clamping his eyes shut . Watch carefully . James Bond can rest easy with competition like this . There are some interesting supporting performances from other actors but not enough to hang a whole movie on . The cinematography is good doing a fine job of capturing the Nordic cold . Even the Sahara winds up looking cold . Perhaps Hamilton carries his own climate with him . There are some individual good action sequences here . Unfortunately the only sense of humor on screen belongs to the villain which turns the hero into a big pill . James Bond's jokes may not be particularly good but at least he does n't look constipated all the time . One positive point in the movie's favor is that the psychotic contorted vicious hatred of Israel in Guillou's books has been left out . What has been kept in is worship of a noble heroic PLO that he shows us functioning in Libya without the dictator Khaddafi's knowledge or supervision . This fantasy is hard to believe since Khaddafi actually threw the PLO out of Libya for four years at a time . And at the end of the film Hamilton gives the PLO a very disturbing gift . Where will they use that gift ? Hamilton does n't care . We're a long long way away from For Whom the Bell Tolls'' here . Commander Hamilton will remain a local phenomenon . While Henning Mankell's books sell well around the world Jan Guillou will never have the same success . As for this film bleeeeaaahhhhh .
11779_4.txt,0, This movie which just discovered at the video store has apparently sit around for a couple of years without a distributor . It's easy to see why . The story of two friends living in New York searching for their pal from high school who is now living homeless under the boardwalk at Coney Island has flashes of being a very good film but ultimately is weighted down by the story focusing on Stan and Daniel rather than on their homeless friend Richie . Cryer is as usual very good and the film has a nice stark look to it with the ghostly images of Coney Island . However writer Cryer and director Richard Schenkman are too busy dealing with the fairly uninteresting lives of Stan and Daniel rather than focusing on Richie . One flashback in a music store where Richie has a crush on an employee stands out and really shows the viewer where this film could have gone . But in the end not much . Two many drawn out scenes of annoyance such as inside the Skeeball building . RATING out of

11395_4.txt,0, After watching this film thought to myself they really glossed up Errol Flynn's life ! The movie is really nice eye candy . They really got the and atmosphere of Hollywood just right . The costumes were great . All the women looked glamorous and all the men looked handsome and debonair . Is this a serious film about Errol Flynn's life ? Nah ! It's a fun movie based on all the scandalous stuff he did in his life . Why am critiquing this film ? This is a film that had a lot of promise but failed to deliver . Duncan Reagher was really good as Errol Flynn . He was not as good looking as the original but he made you believe that Flynn was not just a handsome playboy who did not take himself seriously but as a man who although gifted with great talent was kind of disturbed and unhappy inside . Flynn's love life was a disaster considering he had so many failed marriages . He also lost a lot of good friends during his life . He also suffered from unrequited love for the elegant Olivia DeHavilland . The last scene of the film showed Errol kind of begging for Olivia to stay with him and instead she walks away . He is shown in his tux looking really empty and slowly walking around the pool as he pours his drink into the pool . It was a sad way to end the film but kind of fitting because everyone knows by now how he eventually fell apart from his alcoholism and his dissipated lifestyle . This film could've had much more depth could've been better well Sure they showed all the scandals but they never showed Errol Flynn's human center . Surprisingly Duncan Reagher was able to put some emotional depth into the character of Errol Flynn even though the film writing did n't put any depth there . I'll probably never see this film again but can still remember after viewing this film Gosh this could've been so much more . give this film a

This buddy action pairs short stubbly Billy Crystal and the late Ethiopian Shim Gregory Hines together as some witty Chi cops who do n't play by the rules . That's pretty much the extent of the movie . Interest is somewhat peaked by Hines line delivery that is spookily similar to Will Smith's and by cameos of now actors like Memento's Joe Pantoliano and NYPD Blue's'' Jimmy Smits . My favorite scene is dunno the car chase on the tracks guess . Basically just view this movie as a major helping hand in the demolition of action buddy flicks . Well this and Lethal Weapon and Rush Hour and The Man .

She sounds a little like Marie Wilson . She's pretty certainly . But she's no comedienne . Pitts often was used in very small roles . Here she has the largest role .

10400_4.txt,0, group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original and while there is a bit of originality and some skilled drawing in this slacker puppet show take on Dante's Inferno there is nothing especially clever . Dante's Divine Comedy'' was a brilliant piece of social commentary . This film is a vaguely moralistic student film with pretensions to High Art . suspect those who loved this film were those readily amused by the sophomoric pokes at some icons of the political and religious right and that those who hated it took offense at seeing their favored icons poked . Be that as it may few of those pokes actually rose to the level of satire . The high point of the movie is a sudden outbreak of Schoolhouse Rock'' on the subject of lobbying and the revolving door . It's really a shame that the entire film could n't have been a musical . That would have stripped away a great deal of the annoying film school pretentiousness and added a far stronger element of fun .
11445_4.txt,0, young woman Jodie Foster is witnessing a mafia murder reports the killing to the local police and becomes herself a hit target by the mob operatives . professional killer Dennis Hopper hired by mafia is stalking her to prepare for the hit but eventually he falls for her . Then as a parody of the Stockholm Syndrome that defines a case when an abducted hostage begins to like and cooperate with the kidnapper Jodie Foster falls for her abductor too make love and both prepare for a getaway . Denis Hopper the actor tries to align himself with the creative ambitions of Dennis Hopper the director . The result is disappointing and fails to keep pace with the artistic level of a great performer as Dennis Hopper is . There is no real thrill and the script is sometimes naive and predictable . The film is saved to some extent by the performance of Jodie Foster who is not at her best but still shines with her talent beauty and gift . Of historical interest is the short appearance of Vincent Price and in a small act of Charlie Sawn known from his great part in Wall Street'' If you decide to spend the minutes to see the film it is not a complete loss this movie offers easy entertainment but we would expect much more from the director of Easy Rider'' and the actress who gave us the character of Sarah Tobias in The Accused''
7947_4.txt,0, I'm sure a lot of guys will love this movie . The only woman who shows any balls'' pun regretted is made to look talk and seem like a guy the other women are portrayed either as sexual objects with one thing on their mind sex being sexy with sex as their only attribute and skill or as freaked out pretty little princesses who's neurosis negates any strength and professional authority they had before all hell broke lose The only strength Iris has in the end is the result of some advice from a big strong man . Besides my negative gut reaction as a feminist have to give the camera work props and Ethan Hawke is great in the very first scene . After that his performance loses steam . Empty entertainment for a brain that wants to take it easy . At least the film skims the subject of the duality of good in the criminal mind .

Ultimately they learn they were mistaken in their mistrust of some individuals but also happen to stumble across a spy ring they then set out to bust . The film is harmless enough in its fashion although some may well take offense given how innocent Asians really did get singled out during the Second World War . Overall though it's a pretty generic effort and both Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall would have better moments the best of which tend to come here when they ad
2117_4.txt,0, Joe was first released in the US in the summer of Despite respectable notices reasonable box office and an Oscar nom it vanished shortly afterwards and remained forgotten about throughout the before being enthusiastically reappraised somewhat unjustly in the US in the late Thanks to this lengthy unavailability its reputation has gone on to see it placed alongside the likes of Michael Winner's original Death Wish . Although revenge is a theme a film about vigilantism this most definitely is not . The plot is n't worth synopsizing . Its a flabby hammy and bizarrely stagey ramble about an accidental murder and the unlikely relationship that blossoms out of it . That relationship and the largely class quirks of its two leads are exaggerated into ridiculous caricature these two and their situation bear absolutely no relation to reality . Almost everything about the film is cantankerous and begrudgingly antiquated which makes the whole thing completely fascinating . Hippies are depicted as snide and exclusive misanthropes hard drugs either make you sleep or dance around maniacally with lipstick on your face and most young women are prepared to have sex with strangers in exchange for marijuana at the drop of a fly . Its very much a film of the rather than the so why some industry luminaries have begun to include it in retrospective conversations about the beginnings of the Hollywood New Wave is a complete mystery . Martin Scorcese of all people even got involved though probably only to give a nod to the dank lavatorial hues of the grim urban cinematography which almost certainly influenced Taxi Driver four years later . But Joe seems very much like a furious tirade against the likes of Easy Rider and Bonnie And Clyde rather than a continuation of that same insurgent cinematic ethos . It is n't a film of any real artistic significance despite Joe's incontinent fury at everything in his world it remains a story about absolutely nothing but its value as a cultural museum piece is unprecedented . Shot on and around the streets of New York City during the darkest hours of the Vietnam war and at a time when America significantly its cinema was being revolutionized to the horror of the old guard the film ends up in its own completely oblivious and accidental way saying more about that period of history than numerous infinitely superior movies that directly endeavored to capture it . But as a film ? Despite a really surprising and effective shock ending this is basically a Michael Winner film but not as well made . How does that tickle your fancy ? Incidentally if you are like me a fan of spotting arbitrary background lookalikes then check out Harold Steptoe at in the hippy art gallery .
8664_4.txt,0, Mansfield Park in its second half is my favorite of Austen's novels and Fanny Price my favorite of her heroines so I'm saddened by the unhappy fate she's suffered in her big and small representations . The only good reading of the character I've heard was done for radio by Amanda Root who gave it the same quality as she did the character Anne in the film of Persuasion'' a stern sure heartfelt moral centeredness . If the actress had been younger she would have been good visual casting as well but the Fannys that have reached our eyes to date have more resembled respectively Mary Crawford Ruby the scullery girl and this incarnation a jovial serving wench or possibly tart with her high moral principles pulled down a peg . Well had hoped for better but had feared worse . The serial had a solid Edmund in an actor who was best at likable saps and the perfect perfectly abominable Mrs. Norris otherwise it was dullish . The film which was apparently intended as a deconstruction or some other bad theatrical idea came off as a mixed burlesque . After such disappointments and the more recent disappointments of this production's sister pieces new Persuasion'' and Northanger Abbey'' could n't help but have mixed expectations for this one and on the whole it left me feeling slightly better disposed to it than not . It condensed the novel intelligently and in the end left me with much the same feeling as a comic version might . On the other hand to do so it had to rework most of the characters except the Crawfords and it incidentally diminished or eliminated most or all of the most memorable things in the book including its most famous character and what should be if it is n't its most famous scene . The character is the officious Aunt Norris always ready to direct other people in what to do but always managing to avoid having to do any of it herself here one gets no sense of that at all . And with her goes much else her remark that cuts through Fanny who and what you are'' Sir Thomas's discovery that she has forbidden Fanny a fire in her room all these years and his roundabout apology for her Fanny's honesty in acknowledging during a visit home that Aunt Norris for all her faults could manage the household better than either of her sisters . But then that entire trip is missing from the story and so is most of what goes on at the theatrical rehearsals and most of what discomfits Sir Thomas on his return and in fact Sir Thomas himself and his wife are different from what they were . Above all the scene in which Crawford proposes to Fanny one of Austen's most complex is simplified to a bare telling missing from it is Fanny's staunch upholding of what she knows to be right and what she knows to be very probably true against all the distractions Crawford and anybody else can throw at her . To a male reader now no less than when it was written it reveals with unmatched clarity at any rate as far as know a woman goes through in trying to deal fairly but firmly with a man she has reason to distrust . It's a brilliant scene in the novel on TV it's just a scene . And Fanny oh Fanny when will we see your like ?
9766_3.txt,0, do n't care what anyone says this movie is hilarious ! It combines the bleak seriousness of Threads with an anarchic blend of alternative comedy and the results are a severely dark but outrageously funny satire on the brinkmanship policies of both the Western and Eastern blocs at the time . You got ta give the filmmakers credit for even attempting to top the real life lunacy of Duck and cover'' or Protect and survive'' Imagine someone made a movie based on the Dead Kennedys track Sex Makes The World Go Round and you're pretty close to Whoops !

141_1.txt,0, Her bit as a masseuse in the lurid sequel to the original evidently gave someone the bright idea of putting a spanner in the works of the French soft series gambit by inverting the Caucasian carnality and casting Javan stunner Gemser in a leading role in this the rather tame first of a series of sexploiters that became increasingly depraved as sleazier directors took on in sequels . Someone surely not the English over Warner ? was also anticipating an Star Is Born type meteoric rise out the results judging by the way the actress is credited merely with the eponymous moniker of the on heroine albeit with a couple of consonants sacrificed as insurance against litigation . Gemser's tenure in the series saw her as an photographer allowing of course for all manner of subsequent globe adventures . But whilst she may well have been one the very most beautiful actresses on the screen at that time any thespian talent that may have been there to discern becomes mired in the same sort of unfeasibly facile cogitation have to confess that since I've been in Africa find white skin less appealing . that was to be found in the French films . And in this particular entry much to the consternation of the raincoat brigade the essence of on carnality is as much to be found in puerile symbolism engine pistons ! as it is in prosaic couplings although naturally these include generous dollops of lesbianism . Connoiseurs of kitsch are however guaranteed a continuous stream of aural delights what with such epithets of ethnographic wisdom as do nothing to be a perfect black she does everything to be a perfect white''
6847_3.txt,0, agree that Mary Woronov secretary is one of the only good things about this film . She is my favorite actress ever every role she plays is always done so well . Her character is sly sarcastic clever light hearted funny and cunning . She really pulls this role off well and you get a good feel for what her character is all about . The rest of the movie is pretty bad . The music is the most entertaining thing left . One of the characters has this really strange circular radio that she brings with her while she wears her tight zebra striped tank top . One thing that was a little intriguing about the story was the idea that someone hires these three college kids to spruce up an old abandoned theater . He gives them the keys and says go at it . That would be really fun and wish someone would give me that chance ! Imagine going into an old abandoned theater with two other people and you get to decide how to decorate it and fix it up . You have total control over the whole building . That would be so fun ! Unfortunately the characters do not think of this as an exciting adventure they think of it as a big chore . They walk around with long faces and fight with each other the whole time . It's kind of a bummer . But it's fun to think about the possibilities that these people are n't even excited about . The movie does a pretty good job at making you feel helpless or a little spooked out by the theater itself . However the acting Woronov . and possibly Murdoch the boss just because makes a really good money hungry fake smiley business man who never has any luck is really horrible and you just end up feeling unsatisfied . Plus the random slapstick is a little tacky and kind of ruins the reality that the film tries to create . Watch this if you dig Mary Woronov funky Casio keyboard style electronic beats and if you think having a giant spooky abandoned theater to yourself is at all intriguing .

8786_4.txt,0, rented this when it came out on video cassette in After rewatching it again idea about it has n't changed much . was an adult then and i'm still an adult now ! The illogical elements mentioned by other reviewers did n't bother me . This is n't a documentary a fantasy story where animals can talk ! While did n't care for much of the songs liked the one at the end of the picture where it's sang by barry manilow and another person . Some people seem to make an excuse for it's primitive animation by saying that CGI was n't used often in animated features but let's not forget that THE LION KING was released about a year earlier and that packed possibly more excellence than any animated feature that came before it ! But think it's pretty fair to say that THE PEBBLE AND THE PINGOIN was made on the cheap while THE LION KING was n't . The high points for me in as well as today is the suspense generated by the few dangerous underwater chase scenes . also liked the opening scene which takes place on a music notes page and a little bit of the love story . But most of the time story dragged on and was boring . Worth a look if you like animation but if you're an adult and not a risk taker get another Walt Disney production instead of this !

And you got ta love the effort of going all the way to Sweden just to find a sweet Swedish year old blonde have her speak Swedish posing as the Jewish mother of Henry hopper What makes this scene so perfect is that Henrys father answers the blonde Swedish girl in German . The best actor of all in the film must be the nun who takes care of Henrys mother this is a woman who has had no experience whatsoever of acting but still puts in the most convincing performance of all ! All and all this flick is nostalgia for me personally it is after all what gave me a posting on IMDb database . Feelin like a movie
10970_4.txt,0, Even though he only made his debut film in Australia and left for Great Britain and then America to continue his career Australians will tell you that the greatest film star they ever produced was Errol Flynn . I'm not sure he ever even went back to Australia after his breakout success in Captain Blood . Still attribute this film to the well known Aussie irreverence for trashing the reputation of one of their own . Part of the problem in telling Errol Flynn's life story was that he told enough tall tales in his life right up to the very end in his memoir My Wicked Wicked Ways . could see that a lot of the film was based on that and upon reading between the lines of that book . His mother's infidelity to his father was not written but could have been inferred in reading My Wicked Wicked Ways . He did n't particularly like the woman that is clear from a few sources . wish the film had dealt more with his New Guinea adventures that to me was the most interesting part of My Wicked Wicked Ways . As for his street fighting in the Depression tend to disbelieve that . Even if he had been successful at it guarantee that enough of that would have ruined his looks and he would never have had a career as a leading man . Still the folks down under seem to think the atmosphere of Sydney during the Depression was captured well and Guy Pearce is a charismatic Errol Flynn . American audiences know him best as the uptight but honest Lieutenant Exley in LA Confidential which came out the same year as Flynn . But LA Confidential was a far better film .
8799_3.txt,0, Too much stock footage one third of this minute film really slows this one down . Granted that the plot is that John Weston Wayne is sent by Marshall George Higgins Hayes to participate in a fixed rodeo Ro but character development and interaction are sacrificed . The relationship between the Bad Girl a Latina even in the great Duck Soup'' and the Polly Ann Young a Loretta Young look it's her sister ! could have benefited from more screen time . The happy ending is too abrupt although this time John Wayne actually kisses the girl . The most interesting stock footage was the lengthy rodeo parade of real Indians squaws and papooses . But when the best part of the movie is the stunt work by the Mighty Yak Yakima Canutt who gives us jumping from one horse to another and several different running leaps onto a horse you know we're in trouble . As noted by others the final fight with the villain is very poorly done . My copy from Disc Corporation featured an added ill stereo music track that ruins the authenticity of the original film . DVD box had audio on it . If you're going to modernize and colorize it you should add a sounding score with acoustic guitars hoofbeats harmonicas and an accordion . Finally we have to say this is one of the weakest Lone Star efforts .

It reminded me of HRPUFFINSTUFF on sat mornings Its Swedish backdrops make it easy on the eyes Do n't expect older kids to be interested as the live action is way behind the times and most older kids will get bored . is definitely an under age set movie and a nice bit of memories for those of us who were little kids in
12144_4.txt,0, This is a serious film about black revolutionaries and not really an action film . Billy Dee plays a young man fed up with racism who decides to take things into his own hands . It's fairly gritty and realistic without exploiting the characters but still it's not that interesting either and Billy Dee's character though maltreated by white authority figures does n't really come off as sympathetic . It's also hurt by it's extremely low budget . Still it's interesting to look at as it's a good depicttion of social issues .
5034_1.txt,0, Well its ten year's on since this film was released and the sands of time have not improved it one bit again like the other comments made the Aussie film makers should have a little more drama rather than middle class aussies riding around beautiful places on there bikes with not much in the was of dialog . middle class is not funny nor is rich . there is also a mish mash of cast . why is a young woman going to marry a man old enough to be her father it escapes me . It's such a shame about this film looks like a wonderful place to holiday thou . Anyway its an hour and thirty mins of my life will never be able to get back . lifes to short to watch this movie .
1361_3.txt,0, This movie states through its protagonist that the world is essentially sadness and pain and those that ignore this have blinders on . One can argue whether this is true or not . But even if you accept this as true the movie's ending either disputes this by saying there can be some good in tragic situations or forgets this and uses a cliched montage in order to leave the audience feeling uplifted . That the movie metaphorically acquits its protagonist by presenting him as a sympathetic character despite any evidence for that sympathy shows contempt for the supporting characters who were the most compelling in the film . So what you have in this film is a script that is not consistent in its theme and direction that does not bring the ending into sync with the rest of the film . There are excellent performances given by every member of the cast especially Spacey Olin Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson . It's a shame that they were n't supported by a better writer
2811_3.txt,0, have n't seen any other films by Antonioni and the people that saw this one with me agreed that it shares themes and imagery with the rest of his works . Maybe if had seen other stuff by him would have enjoyed this one knowing what to expect . saw it as an almost complete failure for so many reasons . First of all the film introduces interesting deep issues about social relationships feelings the nature of reality versus fiction but this is very often done in the clumsiest of ways making the characters speak as if they were delivering speeches rambling on and on juxtaposing declarations rather than having dialogues . The scriptwriters seem to be so worried that we will not get the point that they prefer to tell instead of showing . Secondly the movie has no rhythm especially in its first half . It is not only that it is slow . Some slow films have been made with an excellent sense of pace and rhythm Sur by Victor Erice Or Scorsese's The Age of Innocence are examples like but for that to be successful it is necessary that we find the characters so engaging or the story so moving that we can adapt to it . This does not happen in Beyond the Clouds where the first episode seems to drag endlessly and the relationship between John Malkovich's reality'' and the love stories fiction'' is at times fluid others abrupt others confusing .
8759_3.txt,0, Well well had seen a lot of reviews on this one and a lot of promo always showing the decapitation scene . But this flick is a tough one . And mean it by all ways . It's hard to find a copy because it was a low budget independent release and because MPAA was on the hunt for every copy on VHS it came out unrated but it had to be rated for the MPAA . So copies disappeared into the underground scene . All people involved in this flick never did anything else in the biz . So it made this flick unique . VHS copies almost never pop up on ebay or other sites and if they do you will pay over a to get one . But due US connections was able to catch a release on DVD sold worldwide . Limited but it was to be a sort of official one . Now and then there are still some screenings of this splatterfest . But is it worth all the hype surrounding it ? As said earlier it is a tough one to catch but also to sit through . There are gory killings there is necrophilia there is nudity but there is also a lot of talking between the coppers . And to be honest if you would like to see the movie in minutes watch the ending it's a flashback in the killer's mind . The blood flows and indeed it's a splatterfest but not the full minutes splatter galore for minutes . The quality of the movie is okay sound okay no hiss colors okay black is black and not blue as in many low budgets . It's okay to watch it but you never will be frightened but it's one to watch with your friends having a beer and a pizza guess . naaaaaaaaaaaaaaah

Anyway eventually decided to watch the second film just so would've seen it . Hoped it would be as good as the first one but . I'm sorry to tell this but the more the humour got American the more yawned . agreed with Kuzco when he started crying seeing all the cheesy footage . Still younger kids and probably veterans too will love this movie to bits they like the old school moralising Disney that is but just had expectations that were an eensy teensy little bit hell of a lot higher than they should've been . Kronk is a lovely character being good hearted and dumb all at once but it were Pacha and Kuzco in drag that woke me up at the end of the movie . ignore Rudy . for as far that's possible Anyway great movie just not my style and as they say you always have to be true to your groove .

Never heard of her before . She is lovely . Captivating . With an animated face and cute bod she is highly watchable . She's got real Poisenality'' More than a passing vibe of Grace Kelly . with youthful exuberance . think she is Irish in gene pool favorite female DNA so it makes some sense that she would resemble the most beautiful Irish American . The movie is unremarkable Katie Holms is classic beauty in the flesh . But Marisa Coughlan is the one you follow with your eyes . In when this movie was made she was around years old in her prime . This reminds me of another silly worthless movie with the only redemption being the Pretty Girl in it . It was Career Opportunites'' with the first time saw Jennifer Conoly . Or Grease II'' the first time saw Michelle Pfeiffer .
2996_4.txt,0, was fairly lost throughout most of this film and am the one who usually understands the works of such enigmatic cinema greats as David Lynch Peaks Fire Walk With Me and Darren Aronofsky Not to say that Northfork does n't make sense on some level it just does n't combine to form a wholly coherent film . As time passes from watching the film its themes and intentions become clearer but during my initial viewing was really confounded and find that this is the major fault of the film . lack of direction . The plot centers on the town of Northfork Montana in the year The town has been emptied and will soon be flooded to make way for the creation of a hydro dam . The major problem is that not all of its inhabitants are willing to be evacuated and relocated . group of men are hired to coerce the remaining residents out of the town before it will be drowned and for the most part they succeed amidst some fairly odd situations and townspeople . Simultaneously the film tells the story of Irwin a very sick young boy is he a fallen angel ? whose adopted parents gave him back due to his illness to the Northfork orphanage that they adopted him from . Father Harlan Nolte cares for the dying Irwin but Irwin imagines does he ? that a group of angels Daryl Hannah and Anthony Edwards have arrived in the desolate and empty town looking for a fallen angel . Irwin has scars on his back and on his head and he tries to convince the angels that his scars are where the humans amputated his wings and halo . Oh yeah and during all of this there is a strangely surreal walking animal on stilts that roams throughout the backdrop of the landscape . There are a lot of other small events that happen in the film but none of them end up amounting to much more than momentary intrigue . One can appreciate the artistic quality of the film obvious that the filmmakers cared deeply about this film and its rich cinematography but the film still tries too hard to be different and then gives up and whimpers to an end without making much of a statement . Like wrote earlier it becomes clearer long after viewing what has possibly taken place in the film . Irwin is dying and so is Northfork and in coping with his own loss and death Irwin has most likely created characters from ideas he gets from the objects that surround him at the orphanage to console him as he is abandoned and his life nears its end . But then again maybe he really is an angel and he has found his kind and can now return home . must emphasize that there are some truly beautiful moments in the film heartbreaking vivid and full of loneliness and sadness . Unfortunately the film as a whole just ends up feeling disconnected and somehow incomplete .

He holds back from violent action however as he is under the instruction of the world's greatest thief the Night Fox . The team then have to pull off a series of heists to pay Benedict back whilst testing their abilities against the Night Fox who wishes to maintain his position as the greatest thief ever . Put simply this film is a complete mess . The masses may argue that it is cool'' and that Clooney and Pitt put in great performances but these are the same people who have a subscription to Hello'' magazine and think that David Beckham has the potential to be a great actor . The story is convoluted it is not complex or clever and it does not have intelligent twists and turns it is just a complete mess that spills out in multiple directions with the hope that the audience will think it is cool and intelligent magazine readers Any respectable movie watcher will however see the film for the farce that it is . Whilst Oceans was n't a great film it had a decent pace was stylish and had some decent twists and turns . This movie loses its way very quickly and then basically gives up . It is as if the director and cast said to themselves hey this is n't really working out lets just have a laugh ! Indeed the cast looks like they are enjoying themselves but was not . will not delve into the plot as its confused evolution does not warrant any examination . The addition of Catherine Zeta Jones is largely annoying . The scenes where Julia Roberts impersonates herself Bruce Willis undertaking a cameo role whilst mildly amusing appear to be a desperate move to keep the audience interested . The movie is so full of plot holes that it as if Arnie has emptied an Uzi into the film studio . Credit can only be given to some scenes where the Night Fox uses Caopeira to undertake a heist against the back drop of some funky music but this is hardly justification to watch the movie . The final scene features the team in a nonsensical drunken stupor this accurately sums up the movie . Stick with the original .

There was a moment in the film when an unnoticed abyss opens seemingly at your feel that had a bit of a WOW factor but to be honest that may have had more to do with me being an IMAX virgin . The commentary provided by Tom Hanks personally found very a nice way to put it ? flag nationalistic'' which did n't go down too well in central London judging by remarks overheard as we left . Over all loved the IMAX experience but dearly wish a different film had been on on that day . The Moon is n't a particularly colourful subject and to be honest a lot of the effects were lost in the monochrome scenery . All that would have been well were it not for the documentary inserts and distractions like the interviews with American schoolchildren which spoiled it a bit

It is a story of a jewel thief and a young singer who each end up in Morocco at the same time run into one another and form a connection . Simple enough ? Well the problem is that this is the sort of film that has ambiguity in both chronology film is not played entirely in order and in reality what just saw really happen or was it only a dream ? Given those parameters as well as the film being bilingual it was really hard to follow and was not sure as to what happened at the end . imagine some deep artsy types could understand this film better than could and it may require more than one viewing to understand .
1410_2.txt,0, was kinda looking forward to Man of the Year a couple girls at my work said it was a pretty good movie and my mom said that she liked it so waited for the rental and watched it last night . have to honestly say that this movie was a huge disappointment . barely made through it because to be honest the beginning was pretty good and very well paced but then it got too dark and not into the movie saw from the trailer . It looked like a good comedy then it turned into a very dark drama that was n't even that interesting considering how many of these types of stories we've had about government conspiracy . Tom Dobbs is a very popular comedian with a top ranks show and has an act where many people would want him to get involved with politics just because it seems like he has a good grip on what should be improved . So he does it he runs for presidency but many people doubt that he can win due to the fact that he's a comedian but he does win ! But Elenore Green who makes sure all the votes are accounted for tries to fix a computer glitch but when the government tells her not to fix it they try to get rid of her and Tom soon realizes that this may not be the job he wanted . The acting was fine the direction was OK it was just the story that did n't work in my opinion . Like said it just turned into a dramatic change of genres because if you see the trailer you'd think it was a comedy and when you start watching it that's what you get but then it just turns into a very dark and somewhat scary drama . would n't really recommend this movie it was one of the biggest disappointments have seen so far .

But their subsequent investigations reveal an even darker force at work linked to a young girl Kanno whose life has been blighted by sadistic abuse . Based on a novel by Keisuke Matsuoka this densely mystery takes inspiration from a variety of sources gialli traditional Japanese ghost stories etc . though some of the images in the climactic showdown reveal a more immediate influence The recent commercial success of Hideo Nakata's RING For all its ambition however SAIMIN is a routine potboiler which stumbles badly after a powerhouse opening are particularly impressive despite some feeble CGI effects though director Masayuki Ochiai who co the script with Yasushi Fukuda rallies proceedings for an extended finale in which the narrative's startling secrets are finally revealed . Ochiai is best known for his film adaptation of novel PARASITE EVE which also starred leading man Inagaki member of Japanese pop group SMAP and while SAIMIN echoes that movie's strong visual sense it falls short as drama and most of the characters are mere ciphers undermining the storyline's emotional pay Which is a shame because the final half hour is galvanized by a series of dynamic set most notably a concert hall sequence in which Dvorak's World symphony is transformed into an instrument of murder ! and Ochiai is well by an excellent production team . However those lured by the promise of gory carnage may be disappointed the film is long on atmospherics and short on splatter . Performances are varied due to the script's limitations but Kanno is outstanding as a young woman suffering from multiple personality disorder which the subtitles on the print under review assures us is n't recognized as a viable medical condition in Japan ! who falls prey to a sleazy TV hypnotist Masu a prime suspect in the murders . Inagaki is bland in a one role and he's constantly upstaged by Utsui a veteran performer whose career stretches back to the Jaiantsu'' series of the dialogue
7552_4.txt,0, The first time had heard of Guest House Paridiso was in the er . washroom'' after having just seen Fight Club . In each urinal was deposited a small round black circle . When the circle came into contact with moisture put it delicately it caused a colour picture to form with photographs of the two stars and the tag line You'll Yourself Laughing'' When you'd finished washing your hands the circle had dried and faded to black again waiting to spring it's surprise on the next victim'' Okay maybe the punchline was n't terribly sophisticated but you have to admit it was innovative . In fact think can honestly say I've never seen anything like it in my life before and these days of over a century of cinema and marketing that's a real feat . What a pity the film that went with it failed to live up to the promise . hate to pan Guest House Paridiso and am indebted to Rik Mayall Twat and Adrian Edmondson Elizabeth Ndingombaba for many years of laughter through their appealing television series be it the invention of The Young Ones the sitting room plays of Bottom or even solo work such as Rik in the New Statesman In fact this would have made an hilarious minute tv special . Unfortunately its an minute film . There's definitely some merit to be had and laughed continuously throughout the protracted finale which spoofed the Exorcist and Raiders of the Lost Ark and involved . well you'll have to see that bit for yourself . Yet often the pace is leaden and a sterile atmosphere is throughout . The two stars taking his usual backseat this time due to the fact that he adequately directs never really get into first gear Mayall only sporadically showing the foul mania that makes us love him on the small screen . Indeed the writers presumption that we are already familiar with the characters leads to them being underdelivered to the audience . The slight hints of depth seen in the series effeminate failed social for example are not present here and instead we are left with parodies of parodies . The Fawlty Towers accusation does pass water complete with drunken chef and unseen called waiter Pasquele'' which uncannily rhymes with Manuel . Some of the ideas such a hotel next to a nuclear reactor with a childrens swing hanging over a cliff face are very very funny but ultimately the frenetic pace is stolen the two constantly looking for a studio audience that is n't there and all the dead laugh'' areas patched up with incidental comedy'' music that would have been dated in a Carry On film two decades ago . Paridiso's brand of puerile sadistic perverse humour IS funny and feel sure it will make you laugh just not as often as it should .

This is Chan in a full on traditional revenge tale of the sort that was cloned and re by countless producers and studios all through Hong Kong Taiwan and Mainland China . Its a very serious story that shows none of the humor and warmth that would catapult Jackie Chan to super stardom . Its also clear from watching this that had he not reinvented himself odds are we would never have known him because his career would have been painfully short . As a film on its own merits this is a good looking but pretty unremarkable movie . was watching it in the midst of an all day marathon of martial arts films and it would have blended together with every other film that watched that day had not noticed Jackie in the film . Honestly do n't think the film is really worth bothering with are too many other better variations except if you're interested in seeing where Jackie Chan started .

9253_4.txt,0, Lord David Cecil wrote an interesting book in the EARLY VICTORIAN NOVELISTS where he looked at the works of Dickens Thackeray Eliot Trollope Mrs. Gaskell Charlotte Bronte and Emily Bronte . He selected these writers as the popular favorites of the first half of the Victorian period and he explained their strengths and weaknesses he saw them to the reading public . Some of his comments are quite relevant to this day but like all criticism it gives an idea of the spirit of the times of the critic's life as well . Cecil thought highly of George Eliot Ann Cross who wrote about seven or eight books sketches and poetry But for most modern readers they are usually acquainted with her shortest book SILAS MARNER which is still read in some high school curriculum . The other books FELIX HOLT THE RADICAL DANIEL DERONDA MIDDLEMARCH THE MILL ON THE FLOSS ADAM BEDE ROMOLA SCENES OF CLERICAL LIFE are still in print for example has most of them in print but are mostly unread . The one of most interest today is her last novel DERONDA where she discusses the Jews in English society and an incipient pre type of Zionism . ROMOLA is her sole attempt at a historic novel Savanarola's experiment of a religiously pure republic in Florence in the Her meatiest novel is MIDDLEMARCH which is concerned with English society in the provinces in the year of the great Reform Bill of Lord Grey . had to read MIDDLEMARCH in college for a literature course . It certainly is a thoughtful book Woolf called it the most grown book in the English language But it suffers all of Eliot's novels from one defect she can not write livable exciting prose . While Dickens is overly exuberant at times and Thackeray can become pompous and prolix and Trollope can become Lord Cecil says very ordinary in his discussion and Charlotte Bronte can fail to explain certain relationships well and Mrs. Gaskell seems best dealing with female characters all of them Emily Bronte in her single novel hold the reader's interest . Reading most of Eliot's novels is like trying to chisel sentences out of blocks of marble with a toothpick ! To date have read about fifty pages of MILL OF THE FLOSS . notice that one of the other reviewers never finished the novel too . But have read a synopsis of what it is about . The Tullivers and her brother Tom are the central figures they own the mill in the title . Although close at the start of the story Maggie falls in love with the son of a neighbor whose father is involved in legal difficulties with Mr. Tulliver Sr. Tom takes a dim view of this relationship and the tragedy of the story is regarding the split between the siblings culminating in their demise at the conclusion runs back to the mill to rescue Tom during a heavy flood and they die together It must have been a success with Victorian readers but it is very gloomy and depressing to modern audiences . The movie changed the ending a little Maggie Fitzgerald does die at the end with her lover and Tom Mason notes their deaths at the conclusion in his record book . The story is totally rewritten except for a double death in the flood at the conclusion . It does n't really help matters . Although Fitzgerald and Mason do pretty well with their parts they ca n't really pull the film up by their work alone . The end result is a fairly minor film that fortunately did not hurt the lead's careers . The only other thing to note is that the boyfriend was played by Frank Lawton who two years earlier played David Copperfield as a grown up opposite Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan . But then Lawton never really had a major film career he just happened to always be around in pictures some good some mediocre .

The plot itself is fairly well worked for a picture of this kind which is a pleasent surprise as is the acting which although a little hammy is better than normal for these types of flick .

147_4.txt,0, usually enjoy watching Laurel and Hardy but this is obviously one of the films they made while they were on their way to becoming a successful comedy team . The plot is all too simple and is mainly based on one joke how strange kilts and Scotsmen are . And that's all . Okay there are some other jokes but did n't find them very funny at all they are outdated and guess were not very entertaining when the movie was first released . Still the movie has got two of the most charming faces in history and they make the best out of the awkward story expect was filmed without a proper script and the scenery is nice to look at . In my opinion watching this is only worthwhile for Laurel and Hardy fans other people should stay away from it .

But love low budget horror sci fic camp classics so forgive this one . About thew only thing that anyone remember from this movie is that little Leonardo DiCaprio made his debut in it . He did OK . The part did n't ask for great acting skills and the direction probably never gave him any chance of providing one anyway Little Leonardo DiCaprio was very cute and so was the girl . The movie is fun if you like horror sci fic camp classics and are experienced in watching them .

8072_4.txt,0, Cuore Sacro combines glossy film effects with a story that leaves much to be desired . With a script that the screen for Touched by an Angel'' might have passed up as being too impuissant Ozpetek still keeps us interested at times . In fact wanted to focus on the positives but found the last act so bafflingly bizarre and awful that think the couple who jumped to their deaths in the very beginning might have been the fortunate ones . This movie is at heart intended a story built on a big twist ending . This kind of tenuous foundation can result in a tremendous success like Tornatore's Una Pura Formalit or god garbage like the films of Night Shyamalan . Cuore Sacro falls somewhat closer to the latter . found the cinematography in general to be above average . The tracking shots of Irene dutifully doing her quotidian laps in the pool were very impressive as was the atmosphere conjured by the interior of her mother's house . For me the grotesque parody of Michelangelo's Pieta when Giancarlo comes in from the rain and Irene poses with him was a bit of a stretch . One big issue that took exception to in this film was Ozpetek's method of simply turning the camera directly into the face of his protagonist and recording the emotions taking place . This worked to fantastic effect in Facing Windows but when employed here it seems that Bubolova is no Mezzogiorno . In fact besides the ridiculous story the main problem with this film is the milquetoast performance of it's main character . It made the final breakdown scene even more unconscionably bad . In this movie Ozpetek continues his crusade against our corporate societies by urging us to be more spiritual necessarily religious and more altruistic . And while I'm certainly one who is very sympathetic to this view felt as if the audience was being hit over the head with a blunt object . Could the characters have been anymore two tended to find this movie very enervating and soulless . Was the evil'' aunt Eleonora anything more than a caricature ? It goes for the people on the side of right'' too like the good'' aunt Maria Clara and the elderly doorman Aurelio . And just in case we might have missed Ozpetek's point he decided to clothe his opposing forces in their own liveries . This brings me to an interesting point about the director's use of color . He clothes the opening couple who briefly take flight in all black as well as Irene we first meet her and after her life the evil aunt Eleonora and of course the good but confused Padre Carras . Black is a color that suggests a definite course the wearer's mind is set and emotionless . It is the color of choice for that indispensable item of modern day armor the business suit . It is also the color of mourning such as the funerary finery sported by the suicidal duo . Finally black is the color of piety such as the simple robes of priests and nuns that Irene emulates in the second half of the film . The other main color and a very appropriate choice for a movie about the sacred heart is red . It is a color that has an extreme inherent emotional component . The character who wears red is bold emotional receptive to new ideas and indulgent . Red is a risky color in modern times it challenges our perceptions of the wearer and at the same time makes the wearer vulnerable . Yet red carries an enormous weight of history and mysticism as the earliest members of Cro man buried their dead in red ochre and indeed the first man named in the Torah Adam is named after the Hebrew word for red . Red also has an anachronistic flavor looking back on the past where red by association a less self attitude towards life was more accepted . So when we encounter the red room mysterious frieze covered walls complete with a red accented menorah and a red painting of a Whirling Dervish ! of Irene's mother good'' characters Maria Clara and Aurelio wearing resplendent outfits of red and finally the painting of Irene's mother in a formal red gown we can see where Ozpetek's sympathies lie . word or two about the soundtrack found the original musical themes to be excellently suited to the story . The quasi theme that signified Irene was great for it's monotony and feeling of restive malaise absolute best use of a constantly repeated baroque theme such a this would have to be in Kubrick's Barry Lyndon with it's masterful repetitions of an sarabande attributed to Handel One absolutely inspired choice was a couple of seconds of an opera aria we hear as the power is flickering while Irene is chasing Benny through the house . It is of the famous aria Ebben ? Ne andr lontano'' from Catalani's opera La Wally'' The aria is sung by the lead soprano who is leaving home forever . As Irene's mother was a dramatic soprano we can guess that this is a recording of her singing and that she is saying a poignant farewell to her daughter as in the movie Irene is soon destined to never again see Benny alive . just have one minor question of the soundtrack why include the famous tango Yo Soy Maria ? love the song and personally could hear it all the time but it did n't really fit here .
4356_3.txt,0, It is extremely rare that see a movie from that do n't love . Noir JDs Sci Drive dig it all the most . Robert Aldrich is a director who has done plenty of excellent work and most of this cast has fine performances under their belt . So what went wrong ? When used to work in the Independent Film world we used to talk about something called actors movies . Actors movies are movies that are unwatchable to anyone but other actors . Actors like actors movies'' because they get to see ACTing which is to say completely over melodrama . Actors love to be given the chance to totally let loose give it all they've got'' and they get a great satisfaction from watching other actors do so . In many interviews with actors they say he was a great director he never interfered with me in any way . Actually that's the opposite of good directing because the whole POINT of having a director on the set is to keep the actors from making fools of themselves given the chance they will always do Apparently Robert Aldrich forgot that on this project . Or maybe he was ill. Or maybe he thought there was no hope for saving the script in the first place so what the heck ? Whatever the case here is an example of a lesser movie that is best forgotten . The characters gesticulate pontificate and generally ham it up all the way through . One thing can say is realistic it's set in Hollywood and everyone acts like their petty problems are the most important thing in the world . Does n't make it fun to watch but it is realistic . What is n't realistic is that a producer so desperate to keep his star under contract is going to go out of his way to antagonize him in almost every conceivable way including requiring him to engage in illegal activity . But this and other plot contradictions merely carry along the melodrama increasing the opportunity for hand and shouted accusations . did manage to get to the end of this film which makes it no worse than a out of in my book . But why test your own endurance when there is so much else available to rent ?

9154_2.txt,0, THE MEMORY KEEPER'S DAUGHTER in the form of a novel by Kim Edwards was a highly successful bestseller and probably was featured in more reading groups than any other novel during its circulation . So what happened when the novel became a made movie ? Perhaps it is the below mediocre screenplay teleplay ! by John Pielmeier that consistently galumphs along in an awkward pedestrian fashion removing all sense of credibility to the story . Perhaps it is the cut and paste direction by Mick Jackson that misses the pacing and character delineation . Perhaps it suffers from the cinematography of an uncredited source or the tears musical score by Daniel Licht . For whatever of these all of these reasons this novel survives because it does make a good case for educating the public about the capabilities of those born with Down Syndrome . And for that it is worthy of attention . Dr. David Henry Mulroney a successful orthopedic doctor is married to the beautiful Norah Mol and their lives are becoming changed by their pregnancy . On a stormy winter night in Kentucky Norah goes into labor and the Henry's rush to a nearby clinic where David delivers his wife doctor is caught in a snowstorm with the assistance of his old friend nurse Caroline Gill Watson After the delivery of a perfect boy child Norah continues to be in labor and delivers an unexpected twin girl . David and Caroline immediately recognize that the little girl is a is before the use of the term Down Syndrome and David having a history of losing a little sister because of a birth defect decides to send Phoebe to an asylum for the mentally challenged Caroline is to make the delivery and Norah is told the second twin died at birth . Caroline follows instructions sees the conditions of the where Phoebe is to be deposited shrinks in horror and decides to keep the child . Aided by a friendly trucker Caroline changes her solitary existence and mothers Phoebe finding a new life in her trucker's Pittsburgh . Norah insists on a formal funeral for Phoebe a fact that deeply disturbs David's psyche and the Henry's life goes on with only the one child Paul leaving submerged pains about the lack of Phoebe's presence . Norah gifts David with a camera lives are like a camera that's where they live in a room captured by a moment and David becomes obsessed with photography . Norah grieves drinks and loses David's attention while David traces Phoebe's existence with Caroline sending money and letters to Pittsburgh . Paul Stentiford to Jamie Spilchuk grows up discovers his mother's infidelities and is angered about his father's lack of communication and understanding and decides to fulfill his goal of becoming a musician and off to Juilliard he goes . Meanwhile Phoebe Hope Nausbaum has matured into a very highly adapted young girl and the manner in which the broken marriage of the Henrys happens and the healing atmosphere of Phoebe's and Paul's lives coupled with the courage that has supported Caroline Gill's struggle to gain acceptance in the world for those born with Down Syndrome forms the conclusion of the film . The cast of well actors tries hard but only Emily Watson is able to resurrect a credible character from this squishy script . Jamie Spilchuk gives evidence of a young actor with much promise . Dermot Mulroney and Gretchen find it difficult to mold empathetic characters form the corny lines they are given to deliver . The film is a mess but the message about acceptance of Down Syndrome children and adults is an important one . Grady Harp

While would not like to claim and portray myself as someone who has seen all the beautiful movies made around the world still any thoughtful and a bit educated film goer can identify that his films do not contain innovative ingenuous plots does not contain lingering effects afterward and MOSTLY contain ridiculous ending and a LOT of melodrama seen profusely in Indian movies .

7022_1.txt,0, Lucille Ball was a mighty power in television throughout the and but she still made an occasional film most notably THE LONG LONG TRAILER and THE FACTS OF LIFE . Although her television career remained strong as the began her movie career seemed to be winding down Ball was determined to have one last big screen fling and the project she selected was the musical MAME . In many respects the role seemed tailor based on the popular novel which gave rise to two different Broadway plays Mame Dennis is a wacky wildly uninhibited woman who inherits'' her orphaned nephew Patrick leads him on a wild tour of life's possibilities bouncing from one comic spree to another . The music which featured such songs as Open a New Window'' and If He Walked Into My Life Today was among Jerry Herman's best work . The supporting cast which included Robert Preston and Bea Arthur was the best of the best . Expectations were high opening night fanfare was tremendous the film was a disaster . Critics were aghast and audiences sat slack No matter what hardcore Lucy fans may say MAME is a fiasco so much so that it is hard to know where to start . It is badly directed badly filmed badly performed and there Lucille Ball is at the center of it all unable to dance unable to sing and grinning like a waxworks dummy while incredibly bad choreography swirls around her . But the disaster is hardly of her making alone the supporting cast fares no better . Bea Arthur and Jane Connell recreate their stage roles of Vera Charles and Agnes Gooch the former is stagey the latter is dismal . Robert Preston manages to sing with a smile but he's pretty much on his own and clearly none too happy about it . The DVD brings the film from the VHS pan release to widescreen but that only means there's more awfulness to see . Everybody loves Lucy but only the least critical fan could love Lucy's MAME while would n't say it's bad enough to make you want to gouge your eyes out you may wish you had . Not recommended .

Initially only wanted to see it because I'm an out and out Neil Pearson fan boyfriend of Isobel the lead However the movie stands up very well without Neil he handles himself very well in this movie he is overshadowed by the three main female characters It's an eerie intense movie the sort the Brits do so well definitely a chick flick'' the house and it's isolated setting giving the movie an almost Wuthering Heights'' aura . The movie is full of tension and the ending shocking yet somehow inevitable . I'm glad watched it it was worth the wait
2418_2.txt,0, Where to begin ? This film is very entertaining if you are new to the wonderful game of rugby however if you live outside the US and do follow the game it is laughable . Various rugby traditions such as the Haka'' which is preformed by the New Zealand All Blacks'' and only by the All Blacks . The leader of the Haka is usually the member of the team with the best Maori pedigree . This is one of the most important conventions of the modern game and has been misused and represented by the writer . The film itself is quite well directed however it is the poor script and over execution that lets it down heavily . Taking into account is is based on a real story it does posses a great deal of clich in the storyline . would strongly suggest that any American interested in rugby watch this film then watch what rugby actually is on Youtube because the rugby portrayed in this film has been distorted and skewed so far from what it really is .
1454_4.txt,0, Before hitting international acclaim with The Silence of the Lambs director Jonathan Demme cut his teeth making quirky comedies . This was one of them and like quite a few Oscar winning American comedies could mention it has a fine concept is well paced has great performances a complicated romance . but it just simply is n't very funny . Pfeiffer is mob widow who moves to the city backwaters after her husband is murdered . The crime boss who killed him takes a fancy to Pfeiffer his wife is furious and to complicate matters Pfeiffer also falls for the cop who is trailing her . All of this should have been a laugh a minute . Pfeiffer sporting a hefty wig is excellent as the widow as is the hyperactive Ruehl and Modine is good too as the nice cop . But the script is simply devoid of one wit humour or punch lines of the verbal or physical kind that this kind of film demands . The result is it raises smiles at best rather than guffaws . It oozes charm but is tediously short on humour .

Savage Instinct should be shown in ALL film classes . It is the perfect template for how to not make a movie .

The audio is often not legible . Acting ? ca n't call anything saw here acting . Reciting ? Hmmm . Ca n't call it that either . Failing ? That works . All that being said .

6807_1.txt,0, In a not totally successful attempt to be taken seriously and move into films Mr. Hughes gives us this film about a young married couple . True it's got every cliche in the book in it silly fantasy stuff and all that but more importantly it's got Elizabeth McGovern . Clearly the best actress to have ever appeared in a John Hughes film she lends a weight to it that elevates the sometimes silly material . Kevin Bacon his hair is pretty good as her husband but McGovern steals the movie with her quiet true moments of honesty . The film fun that worked so well in other Hughes films falls flat here like a favorite uncle whose jokes made you laugh when you were but keeps telling them when you are and you wish he'd find some new material . But keep going back to McGoverns performance because it's truly moving . Mr. Hughes most interesting films to me have real actors in them Kind of Wonderful Breakfast Club and when his material bumps up against a true talent some wonderful things can happen . If only he'd trust that it does n't have to be tarted up with the silly fantasy stuff .
1554_1.txt,0, Explores the frontiers of extreme boredom . Life in a small Canadian town in winter as an experiment in extreme sensory deprivation . Absolutely nothing happens as viewed through the eyes of a blank deadpan totally uninteresting protagonist . Viewers of this film should be prepared to hallucinate in the style of Altered States'' In a groundbreaking study David Snowden found that he could predict Alzheimer's thirty years in advance by comparing the autobiographical essays of nuns as they entered the convent . Those who eventually suffered the disease wrote in simple direct prose . The essays were quiet and contemplative with little optimism or episodes of joy . Now why did mention that ? Perhaps my mind begins to slowly unravel watching this interminable autobiographical contemplative film which shows in simple direct style the bleak and stoic life of a small community living next to giant slag heaps of asbestos . This film became popular at the height of the Quebec separatist movement because of its presentation of this community as permanently wounded victims . Tragically its writer was soon diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in the early and apparently committed suicide .
5828_4.txt,0, All in all this is a movie for kids . We saw it tonight and my child loved it . At one point my kid's excitement was so great that sitting was impossible . However am a great fan of Milne's books which are very subtle and hide a wry intelligence behind the childlike quality of its leading characters . This film was not subtle . It seems a shame that Disney can not see the benefit of making movies from more of the stories contained in those pages although perhaps it does n't have the permission to use them . found myself wishing the theater was replaying Winnie and Tigger too'' instead . The characters voices were very good . was only really bothered by Kanga . The music however was twice as loud in parts than the dialog and incongruous to the film . As for the story it was a bit preachy and militant in tone . Overall was disappointed but would go again just to see the same excitement on my child's face . liked Lumpy's laugh .

10667_2.txt,0, Whoever filled this stupid idea of acting and producing a movie in Himesh's head which is always hidden under a cap covering almost half of his face all the time Only hope this is first and the last as well for God's sake From Assalam Valekum to Gayatri Mantra Himesh has tried every thing to create an aura of his so singing talent which is nothing but atrocious pronunciations of words like Tanhaiyya which completely kill the beauty of the terms so commonly used for love songs . Why does Himesh not smile Simple because he does not use close Up toothpaste Now there this friend of his tailing him around every where and this number one lawyer in the town who has to herself sexily wiggle and try to seduce Himesh of all the handsome German people she might have met earlier perhaps the male lawyers on this part of the world might be cursing their fate for destined to deal with the stiff unattractive lot every day The action scenes are so funnily shot like the event planner attacked by the thief autos riding over the cars so on and so forth . The father of the bride seems to be in a great hurry to get rid of his daughter by marrying her off that he flies to and fro around . Most hypocrite he praises HR for distributing love among people of the world as if they were sweets and on his back coolly gives a lecture to his daughter on these show business men . when Himesh is proved innocent he again unceremoniously dumps the other guy as if it's a game of musical chair did n't get to se the poor guy's face even did you Hansika in the role of Ria looks as if she is in need of an eye check up for strain in her eyes The fellow in the role of a friend is good who has acted quite naturally and should be in better movies like Sharman Joshi for example . Child artist in Trishu's brief appearance is sweet but wasted . It seems today's young generation has gone nuts since they prefer this kind of mockery of lyrics and musical scores and associate gossip with it for example if you sing ek bar aaja the ghost would come . this is a weird taste in music and rather funny . am surprised how such classic lyricists like Gulzar have opted for Himesh of all the people to give music . There is story in Panchtantra that a crow attach so many feathers of a peacock to look beautiful and appeal to the birds but the feathers fall off ultimately and the real dark crow is revealed Hope Himesh takes a hint and refrains from manufacturing such meaningless stuff and wasting precious money which he has earned by taxing his short nose so much His friend does tell him if your nose is cut how will you sing Thanks for showing us Germany Himesh at a reasonable cost of renting the DVD and correct those spelling mistakes will you an extra in movie and no in love There is also a famous number from the old film Sholey Mehbooba on which Mallika Sherawat wiggles once again but this time with Himesh winking at her and conveniently Ria his so real love and his new bride is not around Now that was very clever Himesh At least one thing in this movie which you have done smartly to justify Sherawat's presence But does n't she look a bit washed down

But seriously please great film making not even close and let's put the blame where it belongs . in the writing . Now know they won an oscar for it and boy did they look good emoting on the screen . But Good Will Hunting is an ABC after school special with lots of cursing in it and a slightly bigger budget . What this movie does show is the brilliance of Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Pictures . Mr. Weinstein could take manure feed it to you and make you believe your eating bon bons . And that's exactly what the studio did with the film . They created such high faluttin buzz around it that people believed and wanted to believe it so much that they saw brilliance where there was none . Now know some people think it's a great movie do n't think it's a horribly bad movie like to compare it to more in the middle of the road movies and also to some great Made for TV movies not HBO films HBO films are unusually better than Good Will Hunting would ever be . It's just a nice little film with some good performances Robin Williams was not good in it they just gave him the oscar cause the'd been itching to do it for a while .

3586_4.txt,0, Brief marital infidelity comes back to haunt loving wife Grace Needham by the always sexy Nastassja Kinski She had left town and her depressing husband to embark on a trip to sunny Miami where she was pursued and ultimately seduced by Julian Grant a handsomely evil and manipulative business executive who is portrayed very well by William Baldwin do all of the Baldwin brothers play evil people so damn well ? The seducing of Grace took place as the two drank champagne on a deserted beach they reached privately by sailboat . Grace admitted she drank too much for her own good and revealed the many problems in her marriage . Julian gained her confidence by claiming he would never allow those types of problems to occur if he had a relationship with Grace . Julian's manipulation continued as he described a lost at sea'' fantasy involving the now uninhibited Grace who sat near listening to his every word and becoming more and more engaged with his romantic dream . His manipulation paid off as a few subtle nudges led to Grace's soft kisses paused momentarily by her pulling back as if suddenly thinking to herself am doing ? I'm a wife . I'm a mother . have a real life . Real responsibilities . Sure the two of us have talked about being together lost at sea but that is just a fantasy . Look at what we're doing here . The consequences are real . We're really alone on a secluded beach . Am going to let this fantasy really happen ? She succumbs to the dream as her kisses became more passionate . The once guarded Grace who used to respond to men's propositions by saying I'm married'' enjoyed watching as Julian unbuttoned her shirt leading to more kisses body caresses and her climbing onto Julian's lap ! She smiles kisses moans laughs and frequently looks up at the sun throughout what unfortunately was a brief love scene in which everybody seemed to have most of their clothes on . While thoroughly enjoyed the look of illicit passion on Grace's face as the once devoted wife was being thoroughly satisfied by having sex with a man that clearly enjoys manipulating others will say that on the whole the scene was undeserving of the movie's rating . Julian returned home to find her husband rejuvenated from his securing of a high paying job and she is excited about being able to return to a normal life where she can once again be a loving wife and caring mother . But the evil Julian Grant reenters the picture and is not willing to give up so easily on Grace . Grace has a plan to rid her life of Julian but will it work ? Obviously do n't want to ruin the remaining story line for you . However will say that always enjoy movies involving sexual pretense by a wife when she exhibits uninhibited attraction and behavior that is normally reserved for her husband but in actuality is seeking revenge against the antagonist . This movie would have been much much better if the movie had included more of that in the story line . My feelings are if the movie brings it up then the movie should finish it . And this movie definitely brought it up . Unfortunately certain constraints in the story line prevented this from being significantly pursued . There are many other movies available that succeed with that very point and I'll include their titles in the recommendations'' portion of this section . I'm also open to receiving emailed suggestions of other movies that contain a good story line involving sexual pretense on the part of a seemingly devoted wife . Overall Nastassja Kinski and William Baldwin are both very good . The movie is not .

5154_3.txt,0, My mother took me to this movie at the drive when was around seven years old which is thirty years ago . She had no idea a family movie would be so violent . My clearest memory was of the boy's father's face of pain as he was stabbed in the stomach and killed . This image haunted me for weeks . had learned that lived in a world where a person might stab my father at anytime . How could stop them ? How could my father protect himself ? You must realise that this stabbing is not fantasy to a seven old . It is as real as witnessing an actual event and has no place in a child's innocent mind . It is sad that we still do not understand the impact that bringing violence into the lives of our children has both on our children and our society . If only parents would protect their children from images of violence with the same vigor that they protect them from images of nudity and sex .

2376_4.txt,0, This Asterix is very similar to modern Disney cartoons . Soulless technically good and the usual in for adults . Maybe it's because this is the first cartoon watched after Laputa Castle in the Sky but it was quite disappointing . The plot is contrived and forgettable but it involves Asterix and Obelix going to the Viking's territory to rescue a spoilt teenager who then learns humility and finds love as well . Oh and initially they do n't get on but after facing adversity they all share a deep bond of friendship . yadda yadda . The best bit is to watch out for the little jokes . The Vikings get all the best ones . Such as Vikea Viking's chief's wife giving a list of furniture and skulls to bring back from the next raid . Or the Vikings not knowing the meaning of mercy Oh and Olaf the dumbest Viking is actually hilarious much for the voice acting as the dialogue For example aboard the Viking ship a speech by Abba the captain's daughter Olaf Who is this new guy ? Captain That's my daughter cod Olaf Your . daughter's . a man ?
11014_4.txt,0, This is another of those films can remember from when was a kid and recently managed to acquire it off ebay years on it's nowhere near as good as remember it being . The story is kick started by a event another extra film member in the credits for story development which makes collective ants become super intelligent . Ant species who used to war with each other have ceased rivalries and are now working together . The thing wanted to know throughout was TO DO WHAT EXACTLY ? You never find out what they want . Nigel Davenport and his sidekick travel out to the desert where bizarre ant activity has been noted and begin to study the ants from an impregnable igloo shaped laboratory . Probably the most chilling scene in my opinion was when the two scientists visit the giant square in the crops a square version of a crop circle a result of the ants chomping away . This film was not very scary quite simply because you do n't know whether to fear the ants or like them . All you know is that the ants want people to leave the area so they can get on with their hijinks but you do n't find out whether they are really baddies . It ai n't a sci because the event explanation is too vague to be properly taken into account . It is deffo more of a chiller . TBH the flares daft hairstyles tight shirts with big collars and Nigel Davenports unnaturally big facial hair freaked me out more than the ants ! Did you notice that there are only six actors listed in the credits ? Yup that right SIX and you wo n't see any other human beings in this film at all . Not even in the distance ! This is a plainly obviously low budget film which is a bit watchable because you probably wo n't have seen one like it . ca n't think of any anyway . The filming of the ants is pretty good they must have done months and months of filming before they had the shots they needed to stick in the film . You may well say to yourself the Hell do they get the ants to do that ? over and over but it is all quite simple . You will also notice that the film makers sacrificed millions of innocent lickle ants to make the film too so animal rights peeps STAY AWAY ! Good for novelty value but you may not watch it more than once .

2425_3.txt,0, First off just let me say that live in South Africa where rugby is our biggest sport by far and our national side the Springboks have won the Rugby World Cup twice so it's quite a big deal over here . I've played all my life and I'm shocked at the poor attention to detail in this movie ! At first thought it had the potential to be a great movie considering the cast of Neal McDonough Nick Ferris Gary Cole and Sean Astin for goodness sake but it turned out to be a mockery of the sport . They basically mashed it together with your normal everyday American Football movie . My first problem is that this movie supposedly captures the values of rugby but the discipline or should say the total lack thereof during the games are contradictory to this . In the final it looks more like an NFL game with Penning being tackled of the ball numerous times in front of the referee . would've immediately led to a couple of red cards because foul play like that would never go unpunished in by a referee of that can assure you ! You'd also not be able to find a coach in world rugby who would have so little control over his team . Any coach would take a dump on a players head if he intentionally stiff arms an opposing player or double teams him like they did in the final . card and certain suspension full stop . Secondly it's absurd that a coach would take a brand new player who has played wing all of his life gather move him to hooker which is a highly specialized position and say that it's for the good of the TEAM ? What ? Hooker is a highly specialized position in the front row where you have to be able to scrum extremely well and preferably be able to throw the ball in at line time which Penning NEVER does for some or other reason . By moving a wing to hooker without any extensive long term training it would firstly lead to your team's demise at scrum time secondly the poor kid would probably break his neck ! How is that good for the team ask you ? Finally the overall high emotional pitch of the movie is way too much because even though rugby is a great sport and it builds great friendships team spirit it rarely gets that out of hand corny . I've seen true football drama's with less emotion than this movie it turned out great but in this one Sean's acting skills is dragged way too far and the movie attempts too force an emotional response out of the audience which ends up being boring and hard to watch at times . Hollywood have made some great sports movies over the years but next time they venture into a sport which has just recently picked up in the states they should try and do their homework maybe get some experts into the fray . DO IT RIGHT OR DO N'T DO IT AT ALL !
8356_3.txt,0, have a question for the writers and producers of Prozac Nation'' What is the root cause and what is the solution to the widespread problem of personal depression in America ? In the moving performance of Christina Ricci as Liz Wurtzel the film portrays a young woman with unlimited potential as a Harvard student and as a writer . But this is not a story of success only one of self as we watch Liz bring misery into the lives everyone who comes in contact with her . The film examines divorce family dysfunction drugs alcohol and prescription medication as possible reasons for Liz's unhappiness . But none of those superficial explanations are satisfactory . At some point in the film it would have been helpful to suggest that Liz needs to take responsibility for her life and her problems . No light was shed on what the film alleged to be a runaway problem in The United States of Depression . In the story Liz had a caring therapist Heche a caring roommate Williams a caring boyfriend Biggs and a troubled but caring parent Lange In a key scene in the film Liz is lying in a hospital bed watching the break of the space shuttle Challenger . Instead of equating Challenger with Liz's life the film should have used the image as a starting point for her healing and recovery . This film reminded me of a generic made victim'' film on the Lifetime network . An excellent cast was wasted especially in the earnest performance of Christina Ricci . The real Elizabeth Wurtzel obviously found within herself the resources to cope with her depression and become a successful author . It is unfortunate that the film could not offer us even the slightest glimpse into her courageous spirit .

His performances in Days Of Wine And Roses The Apartment Some Like It Hot Missing name the first ones that come to mind were all worthy of Best Actor nomination . His only win was for Save The Tiger and that's a shame . He gets melancholy down to a science but never brings it into balance with the driver in his character . He actually did a similar character much better toward the end of his career in the one Glengarry Glen Ross . As for the movie wonderful supporting work by Jack Gilford as Lemmon's partner and Thayer David as an arsonist go for naught because the rest of the script is a muddled jumble of cliched vignettes angst neurotic nostalgia and pointless moralizing . Worth seeing once as a time capsule into style experimental direction by Avildsen .

The plot is also very saucy but I'll believe it's meant too be . The thing that really drives me crazy in this movie is the characters they are painfully irritating especially Rebecca played by Lori Petty she's really annoying believe she is the most annoying creature I've ever seen The editing is also annoying very MTV stylized . Another thing that's missing from Tank Girl is an exciting adventure . The humor is n't much funny either . It has some nice visuals though . However a lot of people love this film most of them are women and that's not weird at all because this movie is all about girl power . Tank Girl this is a real chick flick and the best example of an hate film .
2626_4.txt,0, Changi'' is an Australian comedy set in the World War Japanese prisoner of war camp of that name . The story cuts between past events and the present day when the aged veterans plan a reunion . This is a much publicised and controversial miniseries here in Australia . The budget ran over million Aust . dollars historians and veterans criticised it's authenticity and critics pilloried the uneasy mix of comedy and drama of Pearl Harbor'' Series writer John Doyle of the successful Roy comedy team has tried to defend himself with comments about the characters are composites of actual people'' the troops used comedy to cope with the situation'' it's only based on actual events'' one of our actors was actually there'' etc . do n't have a problem with any of these points . Many superb fictional and factual dramas have come out of the Japanese camp experience King Rat'' Tenko'' Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence'' Bridge on the River Kwai'' Paradise Road'' Empire of the Sun'' Blood Oath'' and Town Like Alice'' Black comedy has often been used successfully in dramas Life is Beautiful'' The Great Escape'' Seven Beauties'' Stalag The Colditz Story'' and even Hogan's Heroes'' So why is Changi'' a monumental failure ? the acting in Changi'' is uniformly excellent the music and cinematography is good it is the writing and direction that have let it down . Every scene seemed to give me waves of deja vu . When Anthony Hayes is made to stand in the blazing sun thought Did n't see Alec Guinness do this in Bridge on the River Kwai'' The sudden flashes into surreal song dance brought back Dennis Potter's Singing Detective'' but without the finesse . This borrowing happened so often it smacked of lazy writing by cut and paste rather than homage . The constant intercutting between the past and present stories left me unable to concentrate on either . Flash forward and flash back can be a useful tool here it left me distanced from characters where intensity was called for . The Ausiness'' is overdone every conversation seemed to include stone the bloody crows'' such that was saying get the point know they're Aussies'' Cultural stereotyping extended to the British and Japanese too young Japanese officer uptight British officer wiser Japanese commandant fun rascally Aussies etc . thought was watching Hogan's Heroes on the River Kwai'' After episodes I'm tuning out .
9995_2.txt,0, many people said this was a great movie with Hoffman delivering a great performance . went from suspended disbelief to fidgety boredom to almost walking out . there is no there there . Hoffman does go all out . he is committed to the performance . but sometimes him playing an affected man looks just like affected actor chewing on the scenery . no characters in the movie other than capote are much more than placeholders nell jack perry shawn the sheriff are all one yes the film shows the manipulative preening dishonest sides of capote . it shows them so many times started to wonder why do the filmmakers think we need to have everything spelled out ? and again ? and again ? it refers often to capote's genius but does not show it . it shows him surrounded by fans and flatterers but never convinces us why . but my goal is not to deconstruct the film . am sure others will have other interpretations . for me this was a two movie that felt like five .
7846_4.txt,0, Tycoon will never be listed as one of John Wayne's better post Stagecoach film . It's good in spots has some fine action sequences in the cave in and also in the flood at the climax . But the plot leaves a lot to be desired . What we have in Tycoon is two men who thoroughly dislike each other and that dislike prevents them from working as a team . Multimillionaire Cedric Hardwicke has hired John Wayne and James Gleason to build a railroad . But then he refuses to give them the needed funds to do the job right . Things get really complicated when Wayne falls for Hardwicke's daughter Laraine Day . After a night when they have to spend time alone in an Inca ruin by convention in South America Wayne and Day get a shotgun wedding even though nothing happened . What should have happened is these two should have been locked in a room for hours together to work out their differences one way or another . Their petty spites cause some fatalities among Wayne's crew . But what Tycoon is most known for is another piece of pettiness . Laraine Day was married to Leo Durocher the manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers when this was being filmed . He was a constant presence on the set insanely jealous of John Wayne who he thought might be having an affair with his wife . Nothing to it but he made his wife's life miserable . Not one of the Duke's better efforts .
4889_4.txt,0, Ruggero Deodato is often credited for inventing the cannibal subgenre with JUNGLE HOLOCAUST in But director Umberto Lenzi usually acknowledged as a Deodato rip directed THE MAN FROM DEEP RIVER years earlier in Is it a worthy start for the genre ? Well . really . photographer accidentally kills a man in self and while retreating into the jungles of an Asian country is captured by a native tribe who hold him captive force him into slave labor and eventually accept him when he marries the chief's daughter . Throughout the whole film never felt this was a horror film . It was more reminiscent of a drama like MAN CALLED HORSE which liked better . Ivan Rassimov is pretty good as the photographer but it is Me Me Lai as the chief's daughter who is memorable and great . have always been a Me Me Lai fan ever since her breathtaking performance in JUNGLE HOLOCAUST and she is never given credit for her acting chops because she hardly speaks in her films . She is still very talented and charming . Lots of real animal mutilation is the one thing about DEEP RIVER that could make it a horror film but even that does n't execute well . THE MAN FROM DEEP RIVER is good to see for those who want to see what started the cannibal subgenre but as an entry in the genre is easily eclipsed by Deodato's entries and even Lenzi's own later entries . Recommended only for completists and Me Me Lai fans .

It is not memorable enough to add to your collection and have a considerable amount of noirs . Paul Henreid plays a tough guy in here . He's not one would think of to play this kind of role but he's fine with it . He's a fine actor anyway . Everything including the cinematography is okay memorable . One thing that stood out the abrupt ending . That was a surprise . It was also a surprise to see this under the heading Hollow Triumph . I've never seen the film called that . It's always been called Scar . If you read about a tense film noir etc . do n't believe it . Tense'' is not an accurate adjective for this film .

Yes the cinematography is pretty impressive but that can not be the soul of any movie for me . India has had several problems like many other nations but it has got rid of many of these problems at large . What if a movie is made on racism in America in a particular year which ends with number of Americans still experience racism today How would it be relevant and How would it be some thing so extra ordinary being depicted in cinema . view read from a Deepa Mehta interview was that this movie is being interpreted as a voice for the marginalised every where . From reviews read every where the common thing am hearing is how the director did a great job and was brave in bringing a problem to the world . The movie is more about a specific problem a society faced has got rid of through reforms at large do not see any thing earth shattering about the movie . Moreover the movie lacked soul and shifted between the plots of Chuiyya and Kalyani . Sarala the young Sri Lankan actress portrayed the role of Chuiyya superbly and that was the only thing which impressed me about the movie sadly .
573_3.txt,0, This is a movie about people receiving a love letter . Nobody knows who sent in and nobody knows who it is for . good cast headed up by Kate Capshaw Tom Selleck and Ellen DeGeneres . This however is a completely dopey plot . As an example the Capshaw character one of the leading citizens of a small town in New England takes up with an immature college student who works in her bookstore during the summer . She chooses him instead of Tom Selleck the town firefighter who is crazy about her . If that is n't the epitome of stupidity do n't know what is . Just an example of how dopey this movie is . Watching Kate Capshaw jog is a pleasure but you immediately realize that she has never jogged a day in her life . Another obviously dopey part of a dopey movie .
5152_4.txt,0, The story of the bride fair is an amusing and engaging one and it is to the filmmaker's credit that he sets out to portray rural Minnesotans with the same respect ordinarily reserved for Coast It is weird though to find an independent movie the brainchild of a single person that is as unambitious and clich as a committee Hollywood potboiler . The portrait of rural people is intended to be affectionate think but these characters do n't ring true to me have had quite a few meals in small diners but never overheard a debate on the merits of different nineteenth English novelists . One might suggest that writer Semans has no more experience with rural culture than the Coen brothers and considerably less satiric verve .
3540_3.txt,0, truly was disappointed by this film which had high hopes for . It seems to have been rushed out to take advantage of the success of screwball comedies at the time MGM's own Libeled Lady'' which featured two of the same stars and the success of William Powell and Myrna Loy . Three years into their pairing they were still attractive to watch and filled with fire in their scenes together but a weak screenplay and rushed premise destroys any chance of it being a great followup to the previous year's Libeled Lady'' and the two Thin Man'' movies they had done prior to this . Double Wedding'' tells the story of a clothing store manufacturer Myrna Loy who is intent on dominating the life of her sister Rice future brother Beal and her own servants include Sidney Toler and Mary Gordon When the independent spirited William Powell comes into her life having distracted Rice and Beal from Loy's constant control Loy meets her match . Sounds good so far right ? Yeah an interesting premise falls short sad to say because Loy's character is so one dimensional it is hard to even like her let alone see Powell fall in love with her which we know will soon happen . It's another attempt to put a career minded woman in her place by changing her views on her what kind of life she has been leading something Hollywood did often during its golden age . When Loy says she does n't have time to both run her business and have a man in her life its a groaner . Fortunately other than Powell there is free Jessie Ralph on board . salty wealthy older woman who helped Loy start her business she has an acquaintance with Powell and can see immediately through Loy's cool claims that she loathes him . Rice and Beal are a boring couple and the whole premise of Powell getting between them is senseless . Then an ex of Powell's shows up which really is n't necessary at that late point in the story and the final wedding scene a crowd of people try to get into Powell's tiny trailer is a weak attempt to bring some farce . is funny though that Powell keeps getting hit by items meant by Loy to hit Edgar Kennedy with Those chuckles are most welcome since there are so few others . Powell and Loy would do better in two later screwball comedies Love You Again'' and Love Crazy'' which are sophisticated witty and fun . This film attempts to be all three but ends up a sophisticated bore .
7363_3.txt,0, As a Canadian History major my first thing to say HISTORICAL FACTS ARE NOT ACCURATE ! How can a producer do that ? The deportation of the Acadian was n't in when we see Franklin in London but in How can he pass that in the movie ? The scenes in Londo were useless too . Then for the story for anyone that read Les Anciens Canadians'' you have the story line right there . It's the story of La Coriveau that witch'' Add a love story too and a tragic relationship between mother and daughter ending . Sure it brought tears to my eyes . But that's it . Then there's the fact it's apparently set up in Qu City but it's mostly shot at the Forteresse de Louisbourg . Sure it's a historical site and it's accurate to the time but it was obvious that the scenes were not all set in Qu City . Overall if you're looking for a documentary of New France go get Candad People's History a real documentary on the history of Canda and NEw France . If you want a love story that will bring you tears a story set up in a wonderful forest watch New France .

Those born to Vietnamese mothers and GI fathers often found neither . The Beautiful Country is the story of one such child Binh rejected by his rural village then struggling to find his American father . The film begins with green and wild country but descends into grimy sweaty ugliness and boredom . The considerable talents of Tim Roth and Temuera Morrison are wasted in pointless and ill conceived roles aboard the rusting freighter carrying Binh and is dying brother across the ocean with what appear to be stock shots of stormy seas . New York City offers slave labor and clich characters . While very uneven from it's start the great curiosity of this film is the final segment . Nick Nolte is given top billing among the cast . jokingly suggested he would probably be in the final scene only and was not far from the truth . As the journey brings Binh to Texas and his father the film takes on a serene and austere simplicity . tenuous cohabitation knits these two men together into a family of father and son . The ninety odd minutes of garbage we have just watched is rewarded by a profound and subtle performance from Nolte as they slowly interact . The credits rolled and was surprised to see the names of Badlands executive producer Edward Pressman and West Texas native Terrence Malick .

But no she played it safe . She played herself . She made Rose a total dinner cartoon . Even her songs were uninspired . It was maddening to watch knowing Midler has the talent to rise above her money schtick . She showed promise only once in this Gypsy'' and that was with Rose's Turn . But by then it was too little too late . sincere Cynthia Gibb as the titular heroine gave the film its only true spark and when the role of Gypsy outshines that of Rose you know there's trouble in River City . huge huge letdown .
7979_3.txt,0, This was my very first Bollywood'' movie and found it in the same way many other recent viewers did through Ghost World'' Having done a little bit of reading up on the film industry of Bollywood this week understand somewhat why there are seemingly unrelated musical numbers and romance and comedy in a horror film . But Something for everyone'' does n't always add up to a cohesive product . The ultra musical dance number Jaan Pehechaan Ho'' has captivated the world in a way it probably could not have done in It's all over the internet now with many folks scrambling for a good English translation . Laxmi Chhaya does an amazing job dancing take after take making it all look fresh new and fun even when any normal person would be exhausted ! She rules ! On the beach with Miss Kitty is a light fun and pretty tune in total contrast to the horror plot . Still find myself singing it in Hindi a week later . found a rough translation if you want to live in this life then listen to what say leave your sorrows behind and join the party take my advice those who want to live live with laughter and singing let your hair down and relax people of this world what do you know ? come to me and I'll explain whoever there is who will see me will stop worrying in this world fish swim freely here and there My second favorite number in the film is The Butler's Dream where Mehmood is entranced by Miss Kitty's dancing . The electric tiki idols are just wonderfully tacky as is the entire set of this number . Online I'd seen it described as what would happen if Liberace threw up'' Way fun . Gumnaam is not a good movie as a whole . That's why gave it a rating of It's actually a real stinker of a film with some fun kitschy musical numbers that have nothing really to do with the murder plot .

Hudson seems totally out of kilter in this role . It just did n't work for me . Julie Andrews probably played her part as best as she could but just find it hard to buy her as a conniving deceptive spy . Sorry know that is classic stereotyping on my part . But have to say think this is Julie at her most beautiful and feminine looking . always thought of her as more matronly but then surely that's a result of her roles in Sound of Music and Mary Poppins . No doubt they were desperately trying to get her out of that typecasting in this role . She was quite beguiling in appearance here but still did n't buy her as a spy . could n't keep my focus through the whole movie and found myself tuning in and out and having conversations with those in my room usually never do I'm always shushing everybody So that tells you how little it held my attention . Do n't waste your time !
2704_4.txt,0, Although this movie is inaccurate overall there are some items that may be true . Certainly he was a wild character in his youth having played practical jokes on his fellow cadets at West Point almost expelled several times graduating last in his class and often reckless in his leadership during the Civil War . But history may have made him a scape goat of the Indian Wars . Certainly he did his share of cruel things but how much was he under orders ? Also there is evidence that he testified before Congress great risk to his commission and command that he argued about the fairness of breaking treaties with the Indians and that if he was an Indian he would also fight rather than live on a reservation ! As a character said in the play when asked what will be said about the British about losing the Revolutionary War the character states history will do what it always does . will lie . Who knows how bad a man Custer was . Certainly he was n't the sympathetic character as portrayed by Errol Flynn and later by Ronald Reagan . But also doubt he was completely evil as he is later portrayed .

It's sort of a buddy film with over violence and gore deliberately stereotyped characters and a lot of craziness . It looks to have been made on a budget of about by a bunch of fraternity guys after a big beer keg party . There's a lead who's a frustrated nerd and his loudmouth prank friend who mocks him about times per second . There's a cool monster truck chasing them for hundreds of miles which is the highlight of the film . Whenever this thing and its gnarly wearing driver appear it's a great scene . There's a mysterious girl who randomly appears in their back seat and plenty of giant guys in overalls hanging out in red neck bars . The nerd's friend never shuts his yap and gets them in one mess after another . Their arguing got on my nerves but other aspects of the film make up for it . Sight gags poking fun at several psycho tormenting and trying to croak somebody'' films are everywhere . Take your pick which one is riffed the most Hills Have Eyes Saw and Jeepers Creepers were some that recognized . It's enjoyable insanity if you're in the right frame of mind . Sensory brewskies with your friends can make viewing this more fun it's a good bet that's the condition of the movie makers when they put this thing together .
4638_4.txt,0, World War gets a glossy sepia makeover in Jean Jeunet's relentlessly whimsical Very Long Engagement'' Jeunet's trademark style consists of mechanical almost clockwork narrative construction garnished with lavish chocolate box production values and seasoned with faux humour . It's an approach that worked pretty well with his previous picture the romantic fantasy Amelie'' thanks in no small part to the inimitable contribution of Audrey Tatou in the title role . Applied to vastly more sombre material Jeunet's method backfires rather badly . Tatou crops up again here in a variation on the same sort of sweetly off character as Amelie . She's Mathilde an orphan who lives quietly with her aunt and uncle in an idyllic rural setting determined to trace what became of her child sweetheart Manech Ulliel several years after he went missing in the War . Manech was one of five soldiers court for self in at Crepuscule and sent over the top into no as a punishment . He's presumed dead by all but Mathilde who cherishes the hope of finding him . The film follows Mathilde's dogged quest to find out what really happened and as she delves deeper she uncovers a sad even shocking story of high corruption and inhumanity . Mathilde must filter the facts from the fictions that arise from various conflicting overlapping or incomplete accounts of what seem to be Manech's final hours . All this should be poignant and gripping but it's more often simply confusing thanks to the visual and verbal clutter with which Jeunet pummels his audience . There's simply too much going on at any one time including an intrusive narration that adds precisely nothing to our appreciation of the story and characters . Without a moment's respite from informational overload felt denied the space to reflect on Mathilde's quest or the room to engage with it on my own terms . Jeunet's unceasingly busy camera spirals and swoops and circles caressing every surface contour of his exquisitely designed production but it singularly fails to penetrate to the soul beneath the story's skin . The result is deeply uninvolving and worse grotesque . The First World War was a particularly dark hour in human history . Imagine it re as one of those picturesque commercials for a well known Belgian lager and you have the measure of this film .

9188_3.txt,0, In the aftermath of September in New York this drama about American firefighters was conceived as a salute and tribute to their professionalism . The story is told with a series of flashbacks where after firefighter Jack Morrison Phoenix has crashed through the floor of a burning building and only communicating with Captain Mike Kennedy Travolta via the radio . The flashbacks basically show how Jack grows from being a recruit seeing Kennedy as a father figure to being a firehouse legend . Of course in the present day Jack's fellow firefighters are trying to reach him but they are too late and in the end he lets them leave him and it forwards to his funeral where he is praised as one of the best firefighters they have known . Also starring Jacinda Barrett as Linda Morrison Terminator Robert Patrick as Lenny Richter Morris Chestnut as Tommy Drake Billy Burke as Dennis Gauquin Balthazar Getty as Ray Gauquin and Tim Guinee as Tony Corrigan . The blazes of the film are ultimately all could pay attention to and enjoy seeing the characters tackle them the rest is a bit too chatty for my liking . Adequate !
9151_2.txt,0, just saw a terrible film called The Sleeping Dictionary . One reviewer on Four Word Film Review got it right right when he wrote From to Zzzzzzzzz . The story is about an English colonialist jerk that comes to Malaysia to civilize the savages'' so to speak and ends up falling in love with his sleeping dictionary . sleeping dictionary is a native Malaysian prostitute fluent in English that services Englishmen colonialists and teaches them her native language in return for well the movie never really makes that clear but can only assume he gives her money or something . Needless to say the movie focuses a lot more on the sleeping'' part than on the dictionary'' part of the job description . Things get complicated for our young hero when the forbidden love affair gets compounded by her culture his soap opera domestic situation and his own boundless stupidity in every major decision he makes throughout the film . So yes the movie has some major flaws but on the other hand it delivered exactly the two things rented it for in the first place a beautifully photographed exotic location and an even more beautifully photographed and exotic woman that plays the sleeping dictionary Jessica Alba . My friend told me that this crappy movie was her at her most beautiful and damn was he right . She's not a great actress and does n't quite pass for Malaysian and its pretty obvious that they use a body double for the nudity but who cares ? Jessica Alba has that rare face and figure that's more than just sexy but also beautiful in the way that a Vivaldi violin concerto or a Rembrandt painting is . Sorry to all you feminists out there who discourage objectifying women the male gaze etc . etc . but hope you can understand that mean no disrespect .
1900_4.txt,0, This was one of Christie's later stories . Throughout her long career she was interested in the shifting narrative and the notion of conflicting agents . Both are essentially the same thing and boil down to questions of who it is that controls or creates the situation . In detective fiction the game is a matter of conflicting realities . The murderer intends to change reality to fool the detective the writer intends to do the same to the reader . Both the reader and the detective are in similar battles to create what they see . That's why her stories often include a writer . In her works she explores every combination of tricks she can think of that deal with this . Along the way we often have bodies that are not who they seem and times and intended victims and such . But the real magic of the books is this notion of control . In it was literally a building . Here it is a dead man . Well sometimes that happens but not like this . It is as if the writer were the famous Mr. Rafiel . This is particularly sweet to Marple readers who remember this same character from the Mystery which in a way was also framed by her nephew . In that story Rafiel was the conveyor of the story to the authorities . The producers of this series have an almost wacky commitment to using a different creative team on each one . Sometimes it produces bland work . The episode was rather brilliantly staged . This one is the most lavish of the lot and has an active camera . But unlike the work it has nothing to do with the story . The camera moves and captures merely because it can . The Kane quote at the beginning was a little too literal and blunt . This story is good but the adapter took out some pretty critical stuff and that irrelevant camera annoys . Ted's Evaluation of Has some interesting elements .

The film was directed by noted character actor Jeffries who had previously directed more successfully other children's films namely THE RAILWAY CHILDREN and THE AMAZING MR.

2177_2.txt,0, Chaplin was great a silent comedian but many silent era stars fell when the public heard their voices in the first talkies . In my opinion Chaplin's voice simply did not fit his silent characters that made him rich and famous . His career never recovered when sound came to film . Contrary to most of the reviews have read Chaplin's lifestyle and politics did not help his popularity with the average viewer who expected to be entertained by Chaplin the comedian and not spend their entertainment dollar watching Chaplin's political commentary . Despite Chaplin's awards and knighthood would take exception to his contributions'' to humanity . The Great Dictator was made at the same time Stalin's brutal dictatorship was having it's show trials and both Dictators signed the agreement that lead to invasion of Poland by both Dictators . WWII started in an attempt to save Poland . The Nazi's were defeated in years but Poland disappeared as a sovereign country . This happened during the time this film was made and the investigations of Hollywood by the Federal government . Had Chaplin included Joe Stalin in this satire addition to including the Italian dictator perhaps he would have had less criticism about his politics by the politicians . The Soviet's mistreatment of Jews and dissidents exceeded the Nazi's in time and numbers . Judged simply as a film many of the gags were too topical to be understood by younger viewers who would n't know who Goebbels Goring or Mussolini were . classic piece of art must stand the test of time . Classic Greek Tragedy the Mona Lisa and Beethoven's are still enjoyed centuries after their creation because they are timeless . Films which rely on topical political commentary or currently popular social views usually do not outlast the generation in which they are made . But those that address issues that are common to all generations will probably live forever and receive a high rating from me . Chaplin as the writer director and lead actor must take the blame for what judge as a dated and tiresome film . Chaplin's apologists have excused his decision to leave the country that made him rich and famous . If Chaplin found the US so offensive why did n't he return to his native land . Great Britian fought the Nazi'with blood and money . What did Switzerland contribute in the fight against the European dictators ? Switzerland is like a country club that picks and chooses its members based on race and class and cares little about people who ca n't join the club .
6859_1.txt,0, have been watching LOST'' with my family since the first episode it used to be great . The last season it was very disappointing it seems as if they know what to do with the show so they keep trying to make it up for it by stretching one story line in a whole episode . The present season which by the way decided to keep watching only to see Rodrigo Santoro and also with a tiny little hope that things would get better has been one disappointment after another my husband and son even stopped watching . First of all he only appears for seconds in each episode . But the real problem is with the story line THERE IS NOTHING REALLY HAPPENING each episode could be shown in minutes . We watch each episode waiting for something that never happens am not asking that every secret be revealed at once but how about some variation in the story lines ? In the first and second seasons we had different story lines we saw the characters history a little action a little romance now is like one big event that takes the whole episode to unveil . It is almost tiring to watch it when it finishes you have a feeling that you lost your time . Now it is important to note that the actors still great . ca n't believe they killed Mr. Eko was great Jack Fox still incredible the perfect hero so kind magnanimous brave . Sawyer Holloway the bad boy'' is kind of mellowing because of Kate Lylli but that's cool . miss Sayid Andrews Sun and Jin Kim Daniel Dae Kim they are all an important part of the plot should be but we barely see them . hope Paulo Santoro will have a big part on the show if not why did you make such a big deal of him joining the show Hollywood etc Sorry if I've been rumbling for too long but feel cheated by this show . When started watching it was great got used to it and now it is very disappointing to see the way it is going . I'll be here hoping for the improvements ! Katia
10929_4.txt,0, This is a pretty simplistic romance . Girl finds boy girl loves boy girl loses boy girl finds boy . Colleen Moore is the outstanding ingredient in this recipe delivering a wonderfully varied dramatic performance well deserving of an Oscar nom . Equally fine are the aerial combat special effects . Moore plays a French girl whose mother has turned over their field to a British aerial squadron during WWI . She is the daughter of the regiment'' loved as a little sister . Into this mix comes a fill for a downed flyer Gary Cooper . At first they hate each other then they love each other then the entire squadron is sent out on a suicide mission . Cooper returns but crashes in the village and a red cross unit removes him . Moore searches for him is told at a hospital he is dead then wanders the streets until he calls from a hospital window and they are reunited . It's a nice little romance but hardly more than that . Recommended for fans of Ms. Moore and Mr. Cooper

Nancy was one of six female assistants who work with the act and we learn two things about her . First in a moment of drunken weakness Scolari got seduced by her and she claims she was impregnated . Secondly she is living under an assumed name and had a secret from her past . Billy Moses who probably never thought he'd be doing such rough stuff back in law school gets to tangle with a couple of good old boys when goes seeking the truth in Grahn's home town . little more action than usual for Ken Malansky he almost gets himself killed . One big flaw in this mystery is simple forensics . The medical examiner's report should have provided concrete evidence that the victim was killed in such a way that Scolari could not possibly have done the deed . The police should have been looking in a different direction for the killer . When you see who the killer is you wo n't blame the individual but you'll also see how the investigating officer James McEachin got it wrong from the start . It kind of spoils this particular Mason film .

It's a drama and the apparently comedic instances are pitiful . This is not a comedy . It's a drama and the apparently comedic instances are pitiful and some of them appear forced and contrived . It's in the script though not the fault of the acting . The line requirement forces me to write some more .

Carole Lombard is pretty and a wonderful actress . will try to watch Fred McMurray's features .

He connects with the young girl again but this time Matt is on cocaine . His superb voice lovely impetuous mother is in the limelight . She does n't know how to handle Matt's addiction . The movie drags on in search of a plot . Clayburgh is in the wrong role and Bertolucci may have had his head in the moon while directing the picture . The Moon has great symbolism .

6107_1.txt,0, The film is a gross misrepresentation of Orthodox lifestyle and practice . NEVER will a Jewish court enforce a divorce between childless couples . Although the concept exists in Jewish law the conditions are too numerous for it to actually ever take place . Childless couples do find it difficult to cope with their childlessness in a community where children are a very important part of life but nowhere are they rejected'' by their community as depicted in the film . They are treated with extreme sensitivity . In fact many great Rabbis have lived their entire lives without children and never considered divorce . The depiction of Yosef a horrible human being is meant to perhaps subconsciously show the behavior of a typical orthodox male . In reality it is as typical as a violent drunkard rapist is typical of secular society . Both exist in their own worlds and both are despicable . It is surprising that so many people form their opinions about a society based on a MOVIE someone who is personally biased against a community have always thought that it is only the Orthodox because of their narrow and insular lifestyle who judge all secular people based on the violence and immoral conduct they read about in newspapers or see in the movies .
12045_4.txt,0, saw this film when it first came out and hated it . just saw it again years later . actually liked some of it . although Robin Williams was totally wrong for the role . What remember most about hating the film is that it was almost the complete opposite of what had understood when read the book . Since have n't re it can only give you my impressions from the past but am sure of one thing the film is a paean to family life whereas in the book almost ALL traditional institutions including and perhaps especially marriage are shown to be strait that we would be well rid of . The only positive in the book is the wondrous nature of children . that only the very beginning and ending of the film really captures that incredibly gorgeous baby floating in the air . Too bad Williams does n't have a tenth of his charm ! My low mark is therefore from the fact that the film misrepresents the book . As a film on its own it fares better but only for a few key performances . Mary Beth Hurt is wonderful think anyone watching it would fall in love with her . And John Lithgow as an ex football player who has had a sex operation is fantastic . he never once camped it up or made the character anything but commendable and as such his performance had an incredibly integrity . watched him closely during all of his scenes and never once was he anything except womanly . Nothing in his performance ever came near the performance of a drag queen . and that made all the difference . In fact of all the people in the film his is the only one which is irreproachable . It is worth seeing this film only for his performance .
4485_4.txt,0, was talked into seeing this by a girlfriend . was a good guy sweet sensitive and looks great with no shirt on ! thought it was a love story about both of them but it was mainly about his reactions to her letters . Savannah was a likable character at the start of the movie but once she dumped him lost respect for her . She said it tore her apart being away from him and it was hard he was the one a million miles away he was killing people and the only contact he got was through her letters ! She did n't have it hard she had family money and he had a tour of duty ! was so frustrated at the ending when he forgave her he was too much of a sweetheart . would have waited the years and welcomed him home with open arms .

123_4.txt,0, First off let me say If you have n't enjoyed a Van Damme movie since bloodsport you probably will not like this movie . Most of these movies may not have the best plots or best actors but enjoy these kinds of movies for what they are . This movie is much better than any of the movies the other action guys and Dolph have thought about putting out the past few years . Van Damme is good in the movie the movie is only worth watching to Van Damme fans . It is not as good as Wake of Death highly recommend to anyone of likes Van Damme or In hell but in my opinion it's worth watching . It has the same type of feel to it as Nowhere to Run . Good fun stuff !
9071_3.txt,0, The cast of All That'' returns for good humor in the Good Burger'' a place similar to an old fashioned fast food restaurant . The comedy is terrific the fun is non and though clich is a passer for kid and family comedy . movie for all ages this movie is meant to enjoy laugh and pretty much a lazy movie for a rainy day as that's what I'd save this movie for a rainy day . USA aired it today and since know that the cast of All That'' is in it thought that it might be a bit of a chuckle burner but in good fun as Keenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell one of the best young duos of that time were terrific together the pieces came together and everything worked out and it made it into good family fun together with some lazy day work to get off the bad day . May take your order ?
8136_4.txt,0, Of course have disappeared into the movies . The Neil Young concert film of Gold . There have been many great concert films through the years . The best being Martin Scorsese's Last Waltz which filmed the Band's last concert at Filmore West . phenomenal concert and a phenomenal film that is if you love rock and roll and felt as if you had been born into it and were part of the music and could be in the band if you had a better guitar and someone would show you the chords and that with a few chords and a lyric or two you could change the world . you can guess felt all five to the bottom of my twenty four year old soul . Neil Young was in Last Waltz . They had to digitally before digital actually they had to manually scrape a big hanging cocaine rock that extruded from his nose so in the film there's a bright light that is not the star of Bethlehem dangling above his lip and below his nostril . a famous bit of rock and roll history . But Last Waltz was made when the Band and Neil and everyone else was in their thirties and of Gold was filmed last year when Neil is in his sixties and his band looks as if they are in their late nineties and the entire movie could visually be used by the Christian Right and the DEA in the same way that those Ohio State Patrol films of the perils of drunk driving were used when was in high school showing dead teenagers hanging through front windows or dangling from trees or bloody in a ditch . Close your eyes and it is a terrific concert open them and view Dorian Grey's hidden portrait . Case in point the once ethereally beautiful Emmylou Harris literally coming out of the darkness to sing with Neil and from dark to light appearing to be a ring wraith leapt full borne out of the river in front of Rivendale . Ghastly ghostlike a nose that does n't appear in nature and is not an advertisement for plastic surgery eyes that make buttons on dolls look lifelike and the ability to express any emotion human or not constrained by unrestrained over indulgence in Botox . My mind reeled . Daniels . hard for decades . god . Emmylou Harris who saw sing for free at Fred's in Boulder a face a year dead Pharoah would not accept . But the voice as pure as a thick lipped bottle of Boulder beer brewed from the waters of Boulder Creek and closed my eyes and smelled ammmmmbbbererrrrrrrrrgerrrrrrrssss homage . must use homage at least once in any film review . Fred's hamburgers on Boulder Mall and the Steve Martin Pink Panther movie It would have been a terrific concert sitting in the dark in Ryman Auditorium maybe twenty rows back . But close up in close ups it was a medieval morality play depicting the horrors of indulgence and the consequences of a sinful life . The concert theme emblazoned on the scenery Prairie Wind . last song massed guitars counted eight and wondered if irony was at play . do n't think so . Native American bass player a lead guitarist who looked and dressed like Buffalo Bill a piano player whose face looked like the screamer's face in Munch's The Scream the chick singers matronly singers mostly reminding one of the lost youth of senior United flight attendants still plying the friendly skies dressed in matching full length distressed denim dresses . it was played straight . None of them had seen would bet Mighty Wind . It will be a great CD and would be glad to tell tales of hippy dippy Boulder when Neil was a long haired Canadian crooner whose indecipherable lyrics seemed to mirror heartache and loss feelings as universal then as now . But only in a dark bar .

Sure if you just LOVE Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres acting and you think they are the best TV shows on air then you will definitely love this movie . Me personally really like George's work and he is very talented but comedy is not his forte . Some people are natural in comedy and am sure he is great funny to work with personally but comedy he can not pull it off on the big screen . It was a cute movie but would pay to see it ? no Now that have seen it would not recommend it to anyone to spend their money . George buddy love you but please do n't do any more comedies ?

Unfortunately we're left scratching our heads wondering how the dim maniac played by scenery Jack Palance made it as far as stumbled back across this recently and was amused at noticing the incomparable Sid Haig and movie favorite Paul Picerni among the rebels . Fleischer was obviously well past his prime when he directed this foolishness . Some of the lines are classic in a Did he really say that kind of way ? The other thing just noticed is that the score and the sound the dialog are actually excellent the only first elements of the entire production . So do n't watch this to learn anything about history or acting but if you feel like watching this as a goof bring the beers and have some fun .
5520_4.txt,0, Oddly enough it's Fred MacMurray who plays the more screwy'' part in this screwball comedy . Carole Lombard shows a fine performance combining lighter moments with and undercurrent of drama and seriousness . As usual Fred MacMurray remains a mystery to me . The camera is no fan of his he's not that attractive and he does n't have the style and panache to pull off this very Cary Grant role . Ralph Bellamy is excellent as the kind friend coming back to life through his relationship with Lombard's character . One can only wonder why her character would n't want his gentle reassuring love instead of the almost certain doom of MacMurray's ineptness . But that's Hollywood ! The picture almost works but misses the mark primarily due to MacMurray's performance . It would've been lovely to see Grant or even Clark Gable in his role . Lombard and Bellamy are largely believable and likable MacMurray is stiff and makes you want to keep him at arm's length .
3763_2.txt,0, Minor spoilers First must say how rare and charming it is to find a movie with such basic messages in it nuclear war will inevitably destroy all of civilization and women are for making babies . It is absolutely incredible how well formulated the plot is to hit in these two points as with a golden hammer . Essentially everything about this movie annoyed me . The casual sexism the character whose sole trait was coming from Texas the mysterious choice of dying Mars orange and of course the flawed science of it all . Then the martian woman screaming as if she had just noticed that she was blind ? What was that ? However will give it credit . The fifties did spit out some sillier things . But not much .
11810_4.txt,0, Ken Burns Baseball'' is a decent documentary . it presents a clear origin of the game a great depiction of baseball's early years and heroes . There's plenty in this movie for any baseball fan . that said the film has several glaring flaws . hours is simply too long for the human attention span . It's clear that Burns stretched his film out to fit his nine inning'' concept . It's not even a tight hours . the pace on every segment is slow almost morose . the music always nostalgic and wistful . Is n't baseball ever exciting and fun ? Why is every player and their accomplishments presented in the form of a tragedy ? Talking head after talking head turn every pitch into an emotional heartbreak yakking about baseball as a metaphor baseball as Americana the psychology and theology of baseball . enough ! This is syrupy mawkish drivel . Billy Crystal is here to sell us all the Yankee hokum he's sold us before . Ken Burns uses the National Anthem as the series theme song and manages to play Take Me Out To The Ballgame'' so many times you might vomit . We get it dude . Clearly Burns is a neo faux so he spends probably a third of the film on the Negro leagues . these segments are spent chastising whites of yesterday for not being as open as Kenny is today . For shame ! He chides baseball for being segregated in the thirties and forties but fails to realize that America was segregated in those times ! Burns falls head over heels in love with Buck O'Neil a former negro player and drools over every piece of footage in which the elderly O'Neil waxes poetic about his playing days . Nonsense . Burns would have been better off with an adult to help him edit his creation down . Baseball'' winds up as mushy gushy civil propaganda disguised as Americana . Its clear that Burns is not a baseball fan . otherwise he would know we watch games laughing and cheering not weeping and reciting soliloquies . are you listening Mr. Burns ? There's no crying in baseball .
10053_4.txt,0, CAUTION SPOILER At the end of the movie it is announced that the bridge collapsed just a few days after it was captured . The impression is that the attack was all for nothing . In reality taking the bridge at Remagen was the last important victory for the Western Allies . It was the crossing of the Rhine that the Allies had been trying to achieve for six months . Because the Remagen Bridge was taken the war ended in just a few weeks . The bridge only need to last for a day after it was captured . This was enough time for the Americans to send combat engineers and a large protective force to the other side and they could then start building a series of pontoon bridges . The taking of the bridge was a complete success and meant the that the end of the war was near and would not last through the summer . Contrary to the cynical nature of the film the victory was heralded with elation by the troops who did it . They knew how vital the battle was . This film has little to do with real history . It was more a reflection of the cynical nature of the time in which it was produced .
7557_4.txt,0, Ken Harrison a young sculptor in his early thirties is seriously injured in a road accident . End of story . End of story'' that is in the sense of end of any physical action'' Not in the sense of end of the film'' Ken's life is saved but he is paralysed from the neck down . When he discovers that he is unlikely ever to regain the use of his limbs he decides that he wants to die and asks the doctors to end the medical treatment which is keeping him alive . The rest of the film is essentially one long debate about the rights and wrongs of euthanasia and the right to die . Ken's main antagonist in this debate is his doctor Michael Emerson . Although the case against euthanasia is often presented in religious terms here it is presented in purely secular ones . If Dr Emerson has any deep religious convictions these are never expressed in the film . He believes passionately however that death is an enemy against which it is his duty as a doctor to fight to allow a patient effectively to take his own life would represent a surrender to that enemy and a dereliction of that duty . Ken therefore finds himself in a Catch situation . He must be able to show that he is sane and rational enough to make the decision to end his life . Emerson however considers that a wish to die is in itself evidence of insanity and irrationality . Ken's dilemma can only be solved by hiring a lawyer to sue the hospital . Richard Dreyfuss as Ken and John Cassavetes as Dr Emerson put across their respective points of view skilfully and with sincerity but this can not hide the fact that Whose Life is it Anyway ? simply does not work as a film . At one time filmed versions of stage plays were done in a similar way to theatrical productions but by the seventies and eighties this was often seen as unsatisfactory because of the differences between the two media . When plays were filmed therefore the general tendency was to open them up'' by filming on location as well as on studio sets by taking liberties with the playwright's text often making significant changes to the plot and even introducing extra characters . have never seen Brian Clarke's play but suspect that this is a story that would work better in the theatre than in the cinema . There is very little physical action most of the action consists of lengthy discussions around a hospital bed in which the main character lies paralysed . Such a plot does not lend itself to the opening up'' device at all and the resulting film is very static dominated by talk at the expense of action . Although it is well written and there is some good acting am surprised that a film was ever made of such an uncinematic subject .

Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery are the couple who discover they were never legally married and spend the movie bickering their way back to true love . It does n't have much of a reputation and it is easy to see why . The jokes are familiar from better films but here they do n't gel . And the leads are uncharismatic . Lombard's performance is clipped and starchy and it's doubly sad to think she was dead only a year later . Robert Montgomery seems to know he's in a sow's ear and tries his damnest to make a silk purse out of it without much success . The best performance comes from Gene Raymond as other man has a lovely drunk scene This is one of the few really bad Hitchcock films .

In July my year old son and traveled to Cappadocia Turkey in search of some remains of the neighborhood where his great grandfather Iordanis lived until the great exodus of Anatolian Greeks in Reading the summary of the film from Odessa thought that perhaps might learn something more about the forced migrations of modern Greeks . If did not have a home in Rhodes had not been to Greece times in as many years were not familiar with dozens of islands and cities in Greece and if had never enjoyed the friendship of these ebullient life people might have believed that this lamentation had something to do with modern Greece . As a professor at a New Jersey State college let me assure you that am familiar with the history of the period covered in the film . Indeed my wife's uncle was murdered by the communists during the communist grab for power . My mother lived through the Italian invasion and German occupation . These characters on the screen speak Greek they listen to Greek music but who are they ? No they are not even vaguely Greek . Of course they are not people at all but simply allegories . They are that which the artist invents when life does not entirely fit or is inadequate to his perception of how it was or should have been . All represent some aspect of post WWI Greece that greater outside forces consigned to a fate they did n't deserve . As we joked in the late in America The Revolution did n't happen . For an ideologue this is no joke . It's in fact grounds to put us through two and a half hours of torment . And it's all because the various Powers soliloquy of guards'' in different colored uniforms did n't allow the generation after the aristocrats'' of to follow the call of peace and freedom music of Nikos and his fellow musicians the Movement the Cause This dark surreal revisionism smears the true and heroic efforts of the Greek people to sustain their lust for life through the tragedies of the century to achieve more than any of their Balkan neighbors to have become so politically evolved and globally integrated .

It's a black flight service with a kick disco beautiful bar and pumping stewards . The plot takes you through the whole idea of a black race or color but plane with the same style of black humor . At times there are some great rare scenes like when the main character uses the lavatory in the plane . Check that out . There are lulls however and find it most in the character who played the Soul Pilot . Watch to find out who it is . All in all it's a fun movie . Tom Arnold adds to the fun with his attitude . This is one movie to watch when playing poker when you're drunk or just vegging .

Many viewers will be left highly uncomfortable with this weird mix of crime and very very corny comedy . Its almost like watching Mr. Rogers play a ruthless gangster very weird . Some things just do n't mix and this film clearly proves that . There are some very good performances here as Dean Stockwell Mercedes Ruhle and Alec Baldwin are all excellent but that does n't make up for the lack of balance and symmetry in the film . Jonathan Demme has done some excellent work in films such as Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia but seems to be out of his element with this one .

The woman begins to see or not see things an people . During the first reel had a hypothesis and thought this ca n't be the whole reason ? Well the ending lived up or better DOWN and gave us what felt was a truly weak final act . The sound mixing and quality is excellent . Saw it in a THX Certified Theatre and was impressed . by the audio and only the audio . The picture is missing substance .

Bergman used his identity as a starting point and did not explicitly comment on this identity as such . Andersson however does the reverse He comments only on this identity hereby dissecting his people to the bone In his world Sweden is equivalent for hell on earth . But he does not take this any further and for me this is just not art but merely annotation . Despite the exceptional amount of time it took to make this filmmaker has serious limitations he clearly can not step out of . Compared to his previous movie fr andra Songs from the Second Floor there is also not much progress to be observed . The intention was that this was more accessible but the difference is minimal and the few scenes that try to please a larger audience are n't the best in the movie . The same absurdism and minimalism also still apply there is the one camera position and the of action in front of this shot . Yes the stills are well done some of the scenes actually work and the coloring and positioning is amazing . But does that make an interesting movie ? Thinking in a negative way this is cinema taken a step backwards . Andersson's background as a maker of commercials shines through in the elaborate setup but find his movies about as empty as those commercials . There is a message about mankind but it is trivial and without much depth .
5644_1.txt,0, The riddle as a concept is an interesting idea but i'm afraid is miscast Vinnie if given the Hard man role is his element as in Lock Stock and Snatch . In this movie Vinnie plays a Newspaper sports writer to be precise during the course of the movie is easily is beaten up with ease and bundled over a balcony by a man who years his senior . I'm sorry Vinnie is tough looks tough and has so to cast him like this is foolish . Trying to investigate the double murders of a friend and a drug addict found near the Thames . He takes on the role of policeman whilst the real police are bit part players interceeding with flashbacks from Charles Dickens . When Vinnie is on screen his reputation precedes him he looks tough but does'nt in this part need act tough snarling at the camera in parts . If you watch the Mean Machine he is perfectly cast and believable and does a very decent performance . Getting back to the movie what confuses the matter somewhat is the flashback to Charles Dickens who is narrating a different story with characters who are also appear in present day these two stories are it appears unrelated apart from the same actors are used . The sound on the movie especially from Julie Cox is inaudible at times and not really fleshed out what her role in the movie is short of Vinnies Love interest she starts the film as a Detecive but quickly becomes the Girlfriend . The Death of the Prostitute is sort of answered but yet answered Strip out the Charles Dickens stuff and you may have a decent movie . Vinnie is slowly becoming Britans Steven Segal stick to the supporting actor role your' e quite good at it .
3057_3.txt,0, This film is about a party put together by the high school scary girl . Per the illogic of these sorts of films she gets permission to hold the party at a house which used to be a crematorium a dubious place long shut down and locked up . Apparently the history of this piece of property is one of those town secrets best left unspoken of among proper folk though the legend does get whispered about among the young . Why was this crematorium really shut down ? What actually happened there in the past ? like these kill films of a supernatural nature as long as there is something in them not copied from a hundred other films . The highlights of this film are a petty theft robbery by distracting the clerk with a vivid view the changing clothes scene by the good girl'' witnessed by her jerk younger brother the eventual demise of the ugly neighbor who hates the holiday the spooky mirror scene and the concept of running water being a barrier against the supernatural the best part of this film is when the possessed party sponsor dances to BAUHAUS in front of the fireplace that scene rocks .
2486_3.txt,0, Some spoilers This movie is sometimes subtitled Life Everlasting . That's often taken as reference to the final scene but more accurately describes how dead and buried this once series is after this sloppy and illogical send There's a hey kids let's put on a show air'' about this telemovie which can be endearing in spots . Some fans will feel like insiders as they enjoy picking out all the various cameo appearances . Co co Tom Fontana and his pals pack the goings with friends and favorites from other shows as well as real Baltimore personages . That's on top of the returns of virtually all the members of the television's show varied casts your old favorites as well as later non There was always a tug pitting quality executive producer Barry Levinson Fontana James Yoshimura and the rest of the creative team against budget NBC execs who simply wanted a another moronic police procedural like Nash Bridges which regularly beat Homicide'' in the ratings . The pressure told as the show bounced between riveting realism that transcended its form and sleazy sensationalism that demeaned it . Unfortunately for this movie Fontana co Yoshimura and Eric Overmeyer and director Jean de Segonzac simply threw in the towel . They took the most ludicrous story are from the series topped it with an unlikely and artistically unfruitful new plot line and laid the burden of carrying the whole mess on one of the weaker cast members . Briefly some time has passed since the last episode of the show . The former heart of Baltimore's homicide unit Yaphet Kotto as Lt. Al Giardello is now a Kurt Schmoke candidate for mayor and Schmoke himself makes a cameo appearance . But this promising start immediately and improbably takes a tragic turn . The spotlight shifts to Giancarlo Esposito as Giardello's son Mike . handsome man who has done good work elsewhere Esposito was one of the pretty faces brought in late to supposedly enliven the TV series . But the question for viewers always was is Mike that uncomfortable as Gee's son or is Esposito that uncomfortable in the role ? To be fair Esposito does n't get a chance to play out the main story without interruption . That's because the writers choose this moment to revive another storyline that spat on the intelligence of the show's loyal voters . An apparent snuff streaming video was promoted and then seemed to actually take place on the Internet . After some red herrings the detectives arrested a repellent suspect . But Zaljko Ivanek's harassed and overworked Deputy States Attorney forgot to file motions in time and the suspect was released only to be murdered later . Let's summarize he forgot to file the paperwork because it was n't the most sensational case of his career because the mayor the attorney general the governor the entire Maryland Legislature the Attorney General NBC Court TV the BBC AP Reuters People The Sun the Washington Post the New York Times the LA Times Time Magazine The Times of London The Economist The Johannesburg Mail and Guardian L'Osservatore Romano Le Figaro Paris Match L'Equipe and Computer World were n't calling every minutes to ask about the status of the case . Nevertheless the old gang of detectives and associates flocks back to Baltimore to help out . There's quite an array of talent on display . Unfortunately with the limited amount of dialogue to hand out some of them are merely on display . Two of the strongest actors Clark Johnson and Melissa Leo are criminally underused while time wasted on Jon Seda and Michael Michelle could be better spent on commercials . The writers do seem to satirize this presenting Jason Priestley as the latest big detective . On the other hand they give easy easy Michelle Forbes a very affecting scene . There's some other sly casting with actual Lt. Gary D'Addario the center of the book that gave rise to the show playing another detective . Guests drop in from other shows like Whitney Allen doing her deadpan and clueless Miss Sally'' from the children's show beloved by the inmates on Fontana's Oz . Dina Napoli of WBAL TV turns up as herself . Even when entertaining though these guests can be distracting . Ed Begley Jr. actually advances the story in his brief appearance playing Dr. Victor Ehrlich from Fontana's St . Elsewhere . He's still a vivid character and fits in a hospital setting . Then you remember did n't St. Elegius turn out to be an autistic boy's fantasy ? The most useful cameo reflects corporate synergy . This movie was made when Court TV bought re rights to the series . That network contributed legal waif Helen Lucaitis who had interviewed the Homicide team and later appeared on Oz . The TV correspondent does an efficient job summarizing the news that is plot points for latecomers . Although she's so thin that she disappears when she turns sideways Lucaitis also adeptly handles a bit of physical comedy with Esposito . He shows more juice in his scenes with Lucaitis than with any of his usual colleagues . Perhaps those two should have done a spin As the movie winds down the cream of the cast rises to the top . Although they are saddled with a loser script Andre Braugher and Kyle Secor overcome it . Their performances remind viewers what made Homicide for considerable stretches the best show on the air and one of the best television productions ever . It's fun to watch top pros do their stuff it's just a shame this movie does n't give them more of a chance . Die fans may want to see this movie anyway but you can live without it .
4400_4.txt,0, The Palestinian situation is fertile and as largely fallow soil for film Intervention tries hard and gives us an insightful peek into the almost surreal life of those caught up in the troubles but the film amounts to little more than a handful of lovely visual jokes thrown onto celluloid while the links between them become increasingly obscure as the film progresses . missed opportunity to say something more coherent about a very topical issue .

He prays Divinity'' will restore his fianc whom he believes was changed into a dragon years ago . Meanwhile in Tokyo an forlorn older painter Edward Peil Kano Indara laments not having a son to carry on his family line of artists . When Mr. Peil sees Mr. Hayakawa's paintings he sees a painter worthy to become his son and disciple . Hayakawa also falls in love with Peil's daughter Tsuru Aoki believing she's the reincarnation of his long lost princess . But with his love fulfilled Hayakawa loses his ability to paint'' An introduction notes Dragon Painter was originally released in by the Haworth Pictures a Hollywood production company formed the previous year by Sessue Hayakawa a Japanese actor who enjoyed great popularity in the silent period . The film was ninth of twenty features produced by Haworth each of which was tailored to Hayakawa's talents and to his stock company of Japanese actors . Fortunately a print of this film was found in France and restored . The description The Dragon Painter is a fantasy of love and creative inspiration that is lost when longing is fulfilled is accurate . With its production Hayakawa intended to provide a different view of Japanese culture to American audiences avoiding the stereotyping violence and melodramatic conflict expected in films of the period . Hayakawa was successful in that part of his goal although this film probably did not and will not appeal to most viewers and is not the best example of its intent .

I've got no problem with the human side of gansters being portrayed but Bugsy steers too far in the direction of soft comical men . The film is enjoyable but is only light entertainment and not a biopic of a man who though exciting was extremely dangerous and fearsome . The acting's all good and the direction very solid . The locations and era are very well represented and the themes very interesting . Did Bugsy really want to kill Mussoulini ?
8403_4.txt,0, disturbing film this climaxing as it does with an intensely intimate reunion between a naked man and his young son but in its confused structure it contains a poetically imagined visual exploration of the innocence of an idealised amnesiac . The plot follows two threads the weaker of which is the gradual revelation of Graham condition . Wound through this though is a beautiful description of his condition and his meandering path towards a partial awakening driven by his affair with Irene . The affair is the strong thread while the specifics of the plot are carried by a seemingly tacked on collection of characters Graham's best friend who can reveal the cause of his condition in a clunking flashback his manipulative boss and his comic book mad scientist psychologist all of whom have an interest in keeping him lost and dependent . The failure of the film lies in the conflict between the two threads . One is visual meandering and sublime while the other is structured like an inept thriller all expository dialogue and unresolved patterns of symbolism . Nevertheless enjoyed Novo . It keeps flirting with the abyss of taboo and shying away into something beautiful as in the quarry with the double bassist and the two women when a setup for a scene of cheap pornography becomes a segment of peace and rejuvenation . still do n't get the tooth though . Odd clunky and a narrative failure but with an almost redeeming beauty .
10423_1.txt,0, saw this film in the movie theater . was taking classes at the Second City Chicago and of course the buzz of this movie was intense . It is a Woodward film about one of Second City's Native sons . Everyone knew about Johns history . Everyone knew how he died . Some even knew that the lore did not make him out to be particularly friendly towards women in improv or comedy . But hey . the man led his life and he was loved intensely by the people who were in his world and lore also states that he treated all of his close friends with love and respect . This movie . Well . Forget the idea of poor Michael Chilklis is a really great actor being in a really astonishingly bad film and really only relegated to doing an impersonation of the man . Forget the idea that they could not get the rights to any of Belushi's work . all the SNL scenes never happened that they portrayed in the movie . Screw the idea that half of the historical information in the film did not even follow Bob Woodwards work . Kinda saying Okay . are about to mess with Belushi . lets go after Woodward too . They also decided to take the premise of It's a Wonderful Life and turn it into It's a Horrible Life on Crack . Is he a guardian angel or the devil ? Is the pinball machine the devil's assistant electronic device . many different endings can you tack onto to a movie ? It is one of those movies after it is over . look at the person you are with and in stunned disbelief go What the hell was that ? In some circles this movie has become a kinda cult classic . But for good reason . good cult classic you sit around the screen and make fun of throw out snappy one liners to the screen . cult film is never good . And most people would never watch them in any serious context . If you want to watch some classic bad late fair stoned ? Rent Wired . If you want to know about John Belushi . can get more information off of the walls of Second City Chicago than this movie .
7886_3.txt,0, first saw a poster advertising this film on a street in Helsinki Finland in June of What caught my attention was the proud proclamation advising all readers that the movie although itself French had been Banned in France'' Upon returning home to New York discovered that one of the Art House'' movie theaters in the City was screening the film and so my Finnish fiancee decided to see what all the fuss was about . Boy did we ever . From the comments read here and the reviews knew the movie was violent and sexually explicit . Not necessarily offended by either of these two conditions went with an open mind to see what had perturbed the sensibilities of our Gallic cousins . Presumably as anyone who is reading this will know the story involves two women who embark on a crime and murder spree in France movie has English subtitles The resemblance to Thelma and Louise'' however ends with that the sex is unusually graphic in copious supply as is the violence lot of stomping to death and a lot of blood and other organic matter splattering after bullet impact On an intellectual level one could make the case that the film's very essence is the relationship of sex and violence manifested by the only sex these women know one is a small prostitute and the other has earned money from time to time by performing in pornographic films . When they during their descent into crime and murder have the upper hand over their sexual situations they react only with the same violence and brutality that they themselves know and understand . It is important to note however that the victims of their rampage are not only creepy men interested in creepy sex which there are several innocent passersby a woman at an ATM for example as well . myself do not really understand why the repeated porn shots were all that necessary to depict the physical contact as cruel unpassionate and debased and the unrelenting gore did get rather tedious after the first few violent spasms . It is a coarse and crude movie but in fairness it is dealing with coarse and crude people and equally unpleasant circumstances . From one point of view the lives of the French underclasses is explored and it's pretty grim a travelogue for France it definitely is not perhaps that's why the French banned it .

Then in The film version hit the Cinemas . when it did Richard Beckinsale had passed away was replaced by Only when laugh actor Chris Strauli . myself felt this gave the film a different feel . would have preferred if it was n't shot as Richard was a key character . like having the porridge film without Godber or Mackay ! The Film did have some classics moments definitely but it felt a bit De Many parts were seen before in the TV Series . Now if you saw the movie first rather than the Series you would get a different feeling about it then the series fan ! Saying that Leonard is definitely on top form and makes the movie like in the TV series . Film has recently had a new lease of life on DVD and is usually on Terrestrial over a quiet weekend . is a cracking good film for Rigsby fans you may feel that youv' e seen it similarly before . Saying that though its worth a buying

In fact the whole movie is refreshing and gives some new impulses . Sean Connery does it once more confident and charming except that he looks a little bit too old . But alright he is the original Bond and it was great to see him once more in this role . The locations are also typical Bahamas France etc . The only thing that really fails is the music score the song Never say never again'' is but the theme song is just missing . All in one a nice try to make a difference from the comic and silly Roger Moore movies like Moonraker'' Only if there was another story Thunderball'' was a excellent movie and really did not needed a remake

My review of the movie itself a terrible dated Troubled Youth'' flick from the My review of the MST version of the movie I've got to say that this is one of the best episodes of MST ever . The riffing is dead all the time . Except for the somewhat downbeat ending this movie is easy material for Joel and the Bots especially Danny's constant screw that Bix has to rescue him from . The host segments are pretty good too especially the segment with the Song . Hopefully Rhino releases this episode to home video one day .
10619_2.txt,0, Now this is a bad movie if I've ever seen one . In one of film's greatest years Detroit Rock City contends with Runaway Bride and Wild Wild West for the bottom spot in a barrel of junkies . The plot is masterful . Four scrawny high school youngsters finally have their chance at seeing the hard rock theatrics of KISS for'' third year in a row . So when their tickets are toiled by an ultra chain mom the pals scramble themselves in getting to Detroit and I'm sure you can figure out the rest . Well not exactly the movie does go to extreme measures in explaining how the four band members not Gene Paul Ace and Peter go about getting these tickets losing your virginity in a confessional saving a smoked bimbo and your mom's Volvo the Soprano's Steve Schirripa nonetheless preventing a robbery in the midst of botching one for a debt and of course stripping down to your bare essentials for MC Ron Jeremy after shuttling a full blender with bourbon Sounds funny does n't it ? Perhaps Detroit Rock City does have a point with all this tomfoolery in how extreme sometimes these fans can go . And we do understand this movie is a comedy it is supposed to be filled with slapstick . But does Detroit Rock City aim to the proper audience ? It is rated meaning the only way prepubescent adolescents audience as see it to which many will eventually hail this one a classic voyeur is through illegal terms . Detroit Rock City also fails at giving itself the late touch . The camera's texture quality is way too clear and way too bright missing the necessary flair from films like This is Spinal Tap and Sid Nancy . This would've allowed audiences to feel at home with the times . Simply costuming kids into pre grunge and settling others into infernos does not do the trick . Environment does mean something you know doubt Detroit looked this glamorous in If there's anything positive coming from this movie it's the kick soundtrack of hard late to early rock . Van Halen AC you name it it's all here . Of course we ca n't forget KISS the band aptly subjected throughout . What the film noticeably fails to manage are questions concerning why the Knights of Satin's Service really just KISS were so frowned upon by moms around the nation . Sure the loud rock and devilish makeup might be a part of that encouragements for youth to explore themselves and have a good time might be fair reasons as well . But what is KISS saying in the music we hear throughout the film towards this highly rebellious group ? What separates these anthems of and roll all night and partying everyday from the rest of the music ? Most likely these questions will remain in a music communication class and not in the films that should answer them simply because it is KISS and they rock and we must do everything in our God power to see them . stars

The whole plot is extremely forced especially the gallant'' effort to save the college from ruin and the moralistic overtone by the leading lady grates a bit .

The shop proprietor and the young guy doing spectacular tap dancing were particular highlights . And liked Peter Hayes impressions of Charles Laughton and Ronald Coleman as well .
3256_2.txt,0, When a hardworking entrepreneur is rejected from a prestigious country club he starts a battle between the members and eventually buys it from Ty Webb Chase and turns it into a theme park course in which everyone can join . This is by no means a good movie but it is still slightly amusing at times . Almost all of the comedy is cheap slapstick and bad jokes except for Chevy Chase . Chevy Chase plays one of his greatest roles as Ty Webb for a second time and plays it great . He is not only the funniest character in the movie he is the only funny character in the movie . Even Dan Akroyd fails to bring humor to this film which aspires to be a great sequel to a classic comedy but falls to rubble with others shown on Comedy Central . The movie might have been better if Ty Webb had a larger role but instead he was reduced to a minor character and the star became Jackie Mason They should have brought back all of the cast and made a sequel the right way ! This is a perfect example of what not to do when making a sequel to an already great movie . Overall Caddyshack II is humorous but a large mistake . do not recommend this movie .

11499_3.txt,0, Frederick Forsyth's books are always so intricately plotted with twists and turns and usually a great surprise ending . This adaptation had none of that . So much of what was great in the book history of Monk and the betrayed agents the plot to influence the outcome of the Russian election were completely missing in this adaptation . Instead there's this completely new plot about bio that was a yawner . Forsyth's protagonists always operated in the shadows forever just slightly beyond the reach of the antagonists . The joys of his books have always been the machinations of carrying out their mission . This film resigned itself to gunfights and car chases early on . Swayze's Monk might as well have hung a sign around his neck saying AM SECRET AGENT'' for all the attention that he called to himself during the film . And with all of that attention the amount of time that it took the bad guys to catch up to him was surprising . Granted there was some energy to this film which is why I'm giving it a instead of a It was also great to see some underutilized pros like Patrick Bergin Ben Cross Michael York and Barry Morse . hope that someday someone will once again do justice to a Forsyth film adaptation like Day of the Jackal'' did .
12185_4.txt,0, This was the next to last film appearance by Jill Ireland who died of cancer in after four decades as a well actress and producer . Ireland made quite a few waves in the press when she dropped her then David McCallum in beginning her long relationship with Charles Bronson . It is a great irony that Bronson probably the all leader in number of deaths rendered on had one of the most enduring marriages in film history . seems to be a movie that was tucked into Cannon's production schedule for the sake of Bronson and Ireland . Ireland was already suffering from cancer illnesses in and you can almost picture the two actors wanting to do one more for old times sake . is carelessly done as a whole showing the lack of polish and dwindling funds that would tank Cannon by But there's a kind of nostalgia value in seeing the couple together one last time and the film makes you wonder what exactly helps a relationship to survive in the chaos that is Hollywood . Bronson plays Jay Killian a high Secret Service agent who is assigned to protect the First Lady Lara Craig The President's wife has a reputation for being difficult bossing Service agents around and wanting to do things her own way . That all changes however when attempts are made on her life and she must journey with Killian by car train motorbike and believe it or not dune buggy to escape would assassins . There is little surprise here as Killian believes the murderers are part of an inside job perhaps arranged by the President himself . On the way Killian and Mrs. Craig develop an unspoken affection for one another in scenes between Bronson and Ireland that are actually very funny . What really gets me is how this film was promoted upon its release and how it's still made to look as a DVD . The original trailer gives you the feeling that is another cold Bronson shoot But a lot of this movie which was rated PG by the way is in a comic vein putting it along the lines of a romantic thriller like Bronson and Ireland's western Noon Till Three . Even the DVD case shows Bronson with a rocket launcher ready to blow things up . Which he does but to a lesser degree than his other potboilers . On the whole is late Cannon slop work and does n't really know what kind of film it wants to be . Besides drifting from actioner to romantic thriller and back again there are serious mistakes in continuity property values are bottom cheap and the effects are dreadful many of the explosions seem like matte work rather than being done on location . Robert Ragland who had shown good composing skills in earlier films teamed up with Valentine McCallum on a score that is mostly synthesized and better fit for television . Richard Sale's script has real lulus of dialogue with the conversations between Bronson and Ireland the only bright spot . There is no explanation as to why the First Lady is called Momma all of a sudden nor as to why Ireland is left with her British accent when the character is a Wyoming native . Jan Gan Boyd playing Killian's main assistant has a kitten personality and is badly miscast as a federal agent . Stephen Elliott former Tony Award nominee who died in May Randy Brooks Erik Stern assassin Bracken and Michael Ansara Bunsen are acceptable in their supporting roles . Incidentally this was the last film directing gig for Peter Hunt who broke onto the scene with Her Majesty's Secret Service in and collaborated with Bronson and Lee Marvin on Hunt in is available on DVD through MGM Home Entertainment it is presented in dual widescreen and standard format with three subtitles and theatrical trailer . out of

LOOKING FOR COMEDY IN THE Muslim WORLD pulled it off thanks to a topical subject and a fantastic script not to mention Albert Brooks excellent broodish character portrayal . But MAN OF THE YEAR ca n't come close by comparison . It has a messy message folded in with forced jokes and a twisted love story that is completely unbelievable . The premise initially seemed very promising . Put a Jon Stewart comedy news guy up for President of the United States and see what happens . This independent runner is Tom Dobbs Williams RV a successful TV personality who is pressured into running by his audience . Along with him comes his manager Jack Walken CLICK and his writer Eddie Black Seeming to have very little chance at a successful run Tom Dobbs amazingly wins the election . But did he ? Eleanor Green Linney THE EXORCIST OF EMILY ROSE is a computer whiz at the company who designed the new software for electronic voting at polling stations . She finds a glitch in the system that is quickly swept under the rug by the company's owner and his dark attorney Alan Goldblum INDEPENDENCE DAY Poised to lose billions of dollars if word of this gets out the company's evil men decided to discredit and kill Eleanor to make sure she never tells anyone . But Eleanor is able to get to President Dobbs and finally spill the beans is where the unbelievable love story starts blossoming too Dobbs goes onto Saturday Night Live and explains everything to the world thus removing himself as the newly elected President and ending the careers of those at the computer company and saving Ms. Green's life . Does any of this sound funny ? The comedy is forcefully wedged into the story and is often awkward . Robin Williams blazes for a few moments during a debate but is quickly doused as the gravity of how he became President bears down on him . The message of the film is interesting and debatable too that special interest owns presidential candidates . I'm sure there's substantial truth in this and if you wanted to make a movie about it you could . If you wanted to make a comedy about you could . But Man of the Year is n't it .
672_4.txt,0, The CinemaScope color cinematography of Leon Shamroy is quite remarkable here his use of colored filters for various scenes . The Alfred Newmann Score has to be the most sensual and seductive score Hollywood ever produced . It's a shame it is no longer available on CD . The actors however never rise to the occasion . The accents are so varied from the subdued British of Ustinov and Purdom to the Hollywood of Baxter and Mature that it seems a true hodgepodge with no central vision . Tommy Rettig is jarringly American . Acting styles span the range from zombie to stilted . Only Ustinov as a conniving one servant steals the show what there is of it to steal . The premise the story of a young Egyptian doctor seduced and abandoned by the rich and the parallel theme of the cult of the single God Ra persecuted by the authorities has its interesting points . But when the film's plot fades it is the haunting music and visuals that remain .
48_4.txt,0, It's Saturday it's raining and think every movie should have at least one comment . so just watched The Crime Doctor's Courage'' all the way through . It's a murder mystery with a typical cast of characters and a couple of the usual suspects each with their own possible motive for the crime . The story starts abruptly and the viewer is thrown into the plot with no character development or storytelling whatsoever . guess that's not too surprising for a movie of this period . There are also some moments which look and feel like this is pre but perhaps that is due to the writer's background in radio shows . The Crime Doctor'' is the sleuth who happens to be visiting California for some from his psychiatry practice on the East coast . He hooks up with a mystery novelist friend with whom it is implied has been along for one or more previous mystery solving capers . The novelist occasionally fills the role of sidekick to our sleuth Dr. Watson and also occasionally lightens things up with a bit of comic relief of There is also a somewhat simple but not quite bumbling police captain who at times is annoyed by the meddling sleuth . And then there are the mysterious Braggas a brother and sister who are dance artists at a night The dance is sort of an interpretive dance that happens to be one of those moments which feels more like the than the Though the story location is California the Braggas appear to live in a castle ! There was one plot element which managed to keep me somewhat amused but wo n't divulge any more than that because always enjoy movies more when the story is discovered rather than known in advance . though can think of many many films which would rate higher and it is difficult to say that watching this one is time well spent have not seen any other movies from the Crime Doctor'' series so ca n't make any comparisons .
9213_1.txt,0, Why disliked the movie apart from the sheer ugliness of the actors themselves is that someone might actually believe such crap . First of all The Second Coming of Christ will be at the end of words and when Jesus Christ will come on Judgement day he will not come as He did before in human form . He will come in His full Glory as God and we shall be judged not only for our sins but also for the consequences of our actions . Everyone will ! Secondly have seen the eternal Gay pride illustrated in this movie with the all unquestionable read the Bible last night and it's not written anywhere'' Well it is . Moses cites on different occasions that men who make love to other men or women who make love to each other as if man and wife should be killed because these will never inherit the kingdom of God as they are foul ! If it truly were for us to follow the Bible word for word there would be executions now would n't there ? But think misinforming people does more harm than this would . That was the in the Old Testament . There are lots of lunatics in psychiatric wards who think they are The Son of God but to make a movie after it truly makes you think of how many idiots out there can make a movie .
9057_4.txt,0, did n't hate this one . just could n't adapt to the story . it did n't really grab me . Michael Mann is a very good director but have to disagree with his methods in this . i'm also a fan of Daniel Day Lewis . some projects he's been in are pretty rubbish but his acting is brilliant . my favourite Daniel Day Lewis films are There Will Be Blood and Gangs Of New York . there is one thing loved about this and that was the musical score it gave the film a lot of atmosphere . thats about all liked in it though . this film has a high vote as well which is a bit random . can see that a fair few people will like this but not enough to make the overall rating would give this film a miss if was you but there is a lot of high votes for this so guess you should watch it and make your own views on what you think . did n't really like it . Seaton
8057_4.txt,0, This film is about a young man's painful journey to discovering his sexuality . The film is raw and unpretentious . It does not rely on steamy sex scenes to attract the viewers . Though the plot may seem incoherent and disconnected at times and some events are not properly explained . can understand it though because this film is a collection of memories that are highly personal to the director . The subplot of about his sister and mother probably does not need to exist in the film but can certainly imagine that these are very important events in his life . The low budget of the film is clearly discernible . It is a pity that the sound effects are poorly done . The narration and some dialogs the scene in the classroom with the French teacher have so much echo which makes it hard to make out what is said . The ambient noise notable traffic noise is also captured throughout the film . When a scene cuts into another the level of traffic noise changes . This film is probably not entertaining but it certainly serves as an insightful diary of a young man's journey to embracing his sexuality .
8012_4.txt,0, I'm a fan of Judy Garland Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly but this movie just left me cold . was expecting another American In Paris from Minnelli so perhaps was expecting too much . The movie was short on songs and short of impressive dance numbers . was impressed by the very expressionistic Kelly dance as Mococo on the ship . was also impressed by the Nicholas Brothers in Be a Clown too bad the song was so annoying . also enjoyed Judy attacking Kelly with bric Check Lorna Luft's autobiography for some interesting information on that scene . Actually the movie has what must be some of Cole Porter's most annoying songs especially Nina'' Also Judy and Gene yell constantly like screechy children . The plot is thin is par for the course for musicals it is not saved by impressive dance numbers or by memorable songs . suspect the best parts of this movie were left on the cutting room floor . Please some movie restorer find those bits of film and show us what the movie could have been !
7341_3.txt,0, This film was shot in Randolph County in central North Carolina in when a film crew in the state was a rare thing . The locations were the municipalities of Liberty and Ramseur and the surrounding rural countryside . It is not a particularly good movie . It did have Merle Haggard and it brought life to the hinterlands for a few minutes . The plot is standard shootemup . The cinematography is that fuzzy stuff that came out of the late sixties and early seventies . The local folks were thrilled to be a part of the enterprise . If viewers have difficulty finding a copy of this film a record copy is available in Asheboro NC . Actors not credited include Ben Jones Mimi Pravda Tommy Hull Bill Nunnery .
10396_4.txt,0, Documentaries about fans are always mishmashes and never worth seeing through but found this one made by some of the fans themselves more than usually unenlightening . As a veteran of the original Tolkien craze forty years ago I'd hoped for more than the obvious does n't always equate to the true . If there's anyone living who does n't already know the nature of a fandom any fandom from having been or known a fan he wo n't discover it here . Between irrelevancies platitudes which the actors from the films are particularly prone and acting out fans making the most not the best their one shot at fame could glean little of the special appeal of LOTR the special emotional responses it evokes and the range of the special creative forms those responses can take . In addition the film is rather lazy it slights some facts that could have been got across with little effort what the exact legal loophole was wording of a copyright notice that permitted the books unauthorized publication in the of which take strong exception to the film's dismissal of the covers on that edition as irrelevant'' and psychedelic which they were not . They were the work of Jack Gaughan a very able sf illustrator of the period and some fans including me found them more apt and more attractive than the covers on the rival set .

2871_2.txt,0, did not think Haggard was the funniest movie of all time like CKY and Viva La Bam a lot more . think a lot of it was just really stupid and had no plot for being a movie . highly recommend not paying a lot of money for this movie but anyone who likes viva la bam CKY or Jack Ass should see it . loved many parts of the movie and then there were parts that should have been cut out . think that Jonny Knoxville should have played in the movie because he is a much better actor then most of the people from Haggard and probably could have made this movie allot more funnier . think Ryan Dunn was probably the best actor and it should have had bam skating more .

5522_3.txt,0, Happy Days'' was produced and broadcast from the mid to the early and seems to get more ridiculous with age . At the time of its broadcast most viewers who grew up in the were in middle age with families and the scenes at Mel's Diner probably brought an artificial nostalgia to them . The Fonz was of course the coolest of the cool the actor Henry Wrinkler to this day has never learned how to ride a motorcycle Richie Cunningham was the all blond kid who would probably be elected student body president . Potsie was Richie's best friend star of the show has to have a best friend guess . And Ralph Malph was the bumbling sidekick to the Fonz if not the entire group . loved it when the Fonz would beat up on poor Ralph Malph . And there was Mel the middle lug who ran Mel's Diner . And of course who could forget the appearance of Mork ? Was this really the Ironically films produced during the such as Rebel Without a Cause'' and The Wild One'' have gotten better with age and portray the period more honestly than this show which was produced years after the period it portrays . Unfortunately the TV show Happy Days'' is not in the same league as Rebel Without a Cause'' or American Graffitti'' for that matter . Happy Days'' may have captured some aspects of the with its burger diner juke boxes cool cars and tacky plaid shirts but it is more a nostalgic idealism done strictly for laughs rather than an honest portrayal . American Graffitti'' had something to say about young Americans in the whereas Happy Days'' seemed more about what middle people of the wished the had been like . The result was a kind of watered down fabrication that really has nothing to do with the Happy Days'' is at best a comedy with some of the artificial culture of the as its backdrop . As pointed out by another reviewer the all kid Richie Cunningham would probably have been chastised for befriending the likes of a drop like Fonzie . And Mel would probably forbid Fonzie from entering his Diner . quick history Happy Days'' was originally a pilot called Love in the Happy Days'' that was rejected for broadcast . Comedy pilots that had themes concerning sex and romance that did not make it to pilot airing sometimes appeared on the infrequently broadcast show Love American Style'' which was often aired in place of baseball games that had rained out or other unexpected programming cancellations and alterations . In short Love American Style'' was a throw show that contained all these one comedy pilots that never made it to a slotted debut . Love in the Happy Days'' did appear as a Love American Style'' show sometime in the early but at the time TV executives could not foresee how a show about young people would be popular particularly during the hey of comedy shows centering around middle people such as The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' its subsequent spin such Rhoda'' The Bob Newhart Show'' and All in the Family'' things have changed since now most TV sitcoms are about young people and the industry avoids most shows about middle people like the plague ! Subsequently one of the young stars of Love in the Happy Days'' a child actor from The Andy Griffith Show'' named Ron Howard got the chance to star in a film about young people taking place in called American Graffitti'' directed by the relatively unknown George Lucas whose previous THX had bombed miserably at the box office . Even when it was premiered to movie executives again the studios could not see how a movie about young people in the could become popular because it did n't fit'' with what had been popular in the past although they did n't realize that much of the movie audience had been young in the As everyone knows the movie was a huge hit and studio executives recognized that they had completely misjudged their audience . Somewhere during the theatrical run of American Graffitti'' TV executives realized they had a comedy pilot in their vault that was a lot like American Graffitti'' They brought it back with the original cast plus Henry Wrinkler as The Fonz'' re it Happy Days'' and the rest is TV history as it became one of the most popular shows of the Happy Days'' now seems ridiculous . The characters are flat and cardboard never being more or less than what they superficially are . The issues they deal with are trivial . And their reactions appear mindless and even silly . Nowadays the character of the Fonz seems to be a caricature of well The Fonz . Was the idea to be a kind of parody of Marlon Brando's character in The Wild One'' Looking on the show with fresh eyes feel the producers really missed out on a great opportunity to present the with depth and realism that still could be fun and entertaining . Instead the producers decided on cheap laughs for quick bucks . This is definitely a show that has not withstood the test of time . American Graffitti'' has many of the outward appearances of Happy Days'' but it had an edge . It had an honesty about the characters and their issues . Happy Days'' took the look of American Graffitti'' but failed to take its heart .
11315_3.txt,0, Give director Stanley Tong of Jackie Chan's Super Cop and Rumble in the Bronx and what do you get ? You receive a series of kung fu fights and a lack of Magoo madness . The limited plot has Magoo Nielsen put into an international plot where he steals a world gem . Of course he has no idea what he is doing . In fact he has no idea that he had the gem . Within thirty minutes you could get very bored watching this . There are some very funny moments though like when he is cooking the chicken . You will wish that you were as nearsighted as Magoo . Its a fun movie to watch but its quite a disaster ! You have to love Leslie Nielson because he was made some very funny movies . This is n't his best but he does a good job playing Magoo . thought it was a funny film and it should be recommended to young children because they will probably think that its very funny .
12161_4.txt,0, went to see this film because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go . We were both trying to look at our watches well before the film ended in order to see how much more we had to endure . Two hours and six minutes long it is . It's divided roughly equally between battle scenes a dozen of them all more or less interchangeable and plot development . One would have thought that with the subject being the son of a minor tribal chief who conquers half the world plotting would have been relatively easy . There's a fair bit of raw material there from which to make a pretty good story . However the writers fluffed it completely . We get no real history . We get instead a Hollywood version of history . What sustains young Temudjin through his long almost endless actually or so they seem to the viewer tribulations ? Why the love of a good woman of course . How does he get out of prison ? Well an old monk who recognizes his innate goodness and greatness sets out across the continent to take to this good woman a talisman that symbolises Temudjin's love for her dropping dead just close enough to her for her to find him as he lies there talisman in his hand . And of course she then goes and having become rich and powerful rescues him . How does he escape from the shackles ? Well he goes off to the shrine of the great wolf Tengri some such name and Tengri sets him free by magic . Yeah right . Why does he want to become ruler of the Mongols ? The wolf again apparently . Off goes Temudjin to ask for guidance and surprise ! surprise ! he gets it . Laws he says to himself . What the Mongols need are laws . Good simple ones . Golly it was impressive . And then finally how does he win the decisive battle against his rival's more powerful forces ? Better tactics certainly but also through the aid of the good old wolf again who sends a storm at the height of the battle . All the troops cower as the thunder rolls and the lightning flashes are scared of thunder you see but not our Temudjin . The troops completely wowed by his bravery acclaim him king ! do n't know what induces people to keep producing this kind of garbage . The funny thing is it's interspersed with all sorts of gritty realism lots of slurping of milk dirt and violence . It's as if the producers of this movie wanted to get the trivial things right so that viewers would n't notice how infantile some of the big stuff is . There's heaps of violence in graphic close slashings impalings spouts of blood sprays of blood clouds of blood the blood guys had a great time actually . Despite the realism it's impossible to take seriously . must mention the ludicrous CGI final battle scene . How anyone can think these things look realistic is beyond me . They do n't . Oh and it's all shot in the standard Hollywood style breathtaking panoramas for the spectacular scenery and the super Stedicam stuff for the battle scenes . And the standard Dolby super of whumps and thumps and the constant low hum to sustain tension . Tedious . Avoid .
8173_1.txt,0, used to always love the bill because of its great script and characters but lately feel as though it has turned into an emotional type of soap . If you look at promotional pictures of the bill now you will see either two of the officers hugging or something to do with friendships whereas promotional pictures of the bill a long time ago would have shown something to do with crime . This proves that it has changed a lot from being an absolutely amazing Police drama to an average type of television soap . When watch it feel like I'm watching a police version of Coronation Street or something similar . have to say still like the bill as I'm interested in Police work and that type of thing but really miss the greatness that The Bill used to have . want to rate it as out of ten because you have to admit it has been totally ruined by the people who took the bill over . As for the script and characters they have both gone downhill most of the great characters are gone now a few still remain think and I'm not saying that the newer characters are poor or anything because they definitely are n't its just that they lack the tough looks personalities and script lines that all of the old characters used to have because most of the new ones are at the moment involved with silly relationships and family trouble . Overall being one of the only Police programs on television these days The Bill will always be a crappily interesting thing to watch but like say it has lost a lot of its uniqueness thats the right spelling and would now be classed as a terrible unreal television soap . Recommended to watch for a good laugh over the stupidity of the police officers involved
9507_4.txt,0, is a review of the later English release by Disney featuring Alison Lohman Patrick Stewart and co. really wanted this film to be good . Really really . I'm a huge fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier Miyazaki film was eager to see it . But was shocked shocked say at the quality of this film . Those later films boast well plots characters and the best film music since . This film just does n't come close . Might as well start the positive aspects though . Like all Miyazaki films this one is still very imaginative with a bizarre fantasy setting in a post world where insects are the dominant species . Nausicaa can also boast some far superior animation to other films from its time . not as beautiful and fluid as Miyazaki's later films And the English voice acting is quite well done . But this film . The characters are all cardboard from saccharine sweet little Nausicaa to the ruthlessly evil Tolmekians to everyone in between . Once you've seen each of them for seconds you've seen all there is . And the fact that the plot just ambles along does n't help . Then there's the music . Now Hisaichi is hands down my favorite film composer but Nausicaa does n't do him justice . Half the music is keyboards on overdrive and it usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it distracts the visuals rather than helping them . highly suspect that Hisaichi was told to compose a lot of the music before he even saw the picture . But wait ! There's a great message with this film right ? Let's all save the environment ! Too bad that this film hits you over the head with it like a sledgehammer . There is a scene in which Nausicaa hugs a tree . No really . ai n't kidding . It makes me a little sad to talk about how lame this film is . But for some reason all the other reviews on IMDb seem to adore it . And when the characters have to talk to themselves in extended sentences to tell you what's going on that's lame . If you're the kind of person who worships anime enjoys music and plants a tree every Arbor day you will probably like this film . Otherwise save your money for his later films because they rock big time .
9337_4.txt,0, Right this moment am watching this movie on TV here in Tokyo . Beautiful scenery beautiful sets of biblical proportions beautiful costumes beautiful color beautiful Gina . Great climactic scene when God destroys the Sheban idol and a lot more with de Millean thunderbolts at the moment when Yul and Gina are about to consummate their love . Yul does a halfway decent job of delivering his lines though he sounds a lot like Yul delivering his lines as Ramses or Taras Bulba . George Sanders sounds like George Sanders playing George Sanders . Given the limited range of acting she is asked to display in this role Gina does a good job though by the time the movie ends she is completely converted into a demure remorseful lass and looks likes she might be playing in a biography of Mother Teresa . guess thunderbolts will do that to you but it is almost breathtaking how quickly she jettisons her own beliefs for her new religion . The supporting players are mostly awful lacking credible emotion and timing . The usual big battle scenes what passed for lascivious dances in and an orchestra blasting out plenty of trumpet calls behind a huge chorus singing lots of Ah's'' but none of it quite of topnotch Hollywood quality . The final swordfight between Brynner and Sanders is at the laughingly low skill level of a junior high school play . The film is one big piece of eye candy but not much more .
8830_4.txt,0, This is a good blueprint for a study of corporate power and the dichotomoy between required public life and the need for privacy . Robert Taylor has been primed by corporate head Burl Ives as a surrogate son to replace him as head of the corporation . He sends him to England to negotiate a deal where Taylor is both taken aback by the ethics and morality of the men he is dealing with and manages to fall in love with a refugee while he's at it . He comes back emtpy handed having done his duty but having told the truth to the English about his motives . He attempts to marry the refugee rather than the boss's niece and so begins an attempt by Ives to discredit the refugee as a suitable wife for a corporate executive . It could have been gritter nastier and less romantic the amount of time spent on the romance skews the film away from the points it's trying to make about corporate ethics . Somehow the costume design was nominated for an Oscar it's all business suits and the two women in the film dress conservatively studio politics at work yet again no doubt . What is stiking however is the black and white CinemaScope cinematography which is excellent this if anything deserved the Oscar nom . was MGM's first film in Not as good as it could have been but not terrible either .

7696_1.txt,0, This is a fact that this is the Saudi feature film to be shown in cinema theaters but not in Saudi Arabia for a simple reason we do n't have cinema theaters in our large kingdom not only one cinema theater ! The government forbidden opening cinema theaters after the Islamic extremists OR the religious police both asked for closing it in the late the early accusing the art with encouraging wrong sex relationships and stuff like that do n't see a powerful reason why we do n't open cinema theaters ! we have many videos stores throughout the kingdom we watch movies in the TV from some satellite channels we can install the Showtime'' set channels and after all movies in general seems harmless in many ways know many people how go to neighboring countries only to watch a couple of films personally went to Bahrain several times only to watch films in theaters because watching it there is big fun unlike watching a movie home . Saudis pay the most expensive cinema ticket in the world we travel to watch movies while the rest of the world have cinema theaters around every town . This is one of the problems that we are having ! The movie is produced and presented by Rotana Filmed Entertainment which is a major company belongs to the Saudi tycoon Alwaleed Bin Talal richest man in the world The movie's title is a word means literally how are you ? but it is also a slang means what's up ! sometimes used as a slang to say bad'' about something and sometimes is used as a slang to tell someone politely to mind his business not to interfere in someone else's affairs . Anyway think they meant are you up ! in the same time could be wrong though . Male actors are from Saudi Arabia like Hisham Abdulrahman who is very famous and has some popularity after winning prize in Arabian realty show more like American Idol'' he works in some TV programs like the Arabian version of Cash Taxi'' the other famous actor is Khaled Sami who is funny and has a very good sense of humor other actors like Mishal Al Turki Al and Ali Al Sabea are less famous and they work on some TV series shows . Female actresses are non and they did a very good job speaking the Saudi accent Jordanian actress Mais Hamdan in leading role Emeriti actress Fatima Al not that we do n't have Saudi actresses but are few and not that good . Saudi critic Rja Al who writes for Alriyadh Newspaper most popular newspaper in the kingdom wrote about it saying lets not expect much of the Saudi feature film . It was born in unusual circumstances therefore we ca n't judge it under the usual standards like any other film . It is a fact that the movie hit a huge financial success in its opening days only in Kingdom of Bahrain . The movie is fresh and is about a Saudi family deals with controversial fresh issues inside the Saudi society like women driving cars the low thoughts about the arts the guardianship of the society by a certain group the differences between being conservative and being an extremist . The ideas are good but you feel you are lost in the middle of the movie . One of the movie's advantages is the beautiful music score by Rajeh Dawood which was good but sometimes it does n't match or express what's in the picture . Turki Al did a great job his performance was the best alongside with Mais Hamdan the biggest loser is the leading actor Hisham Abdulrahman who came behind the supporting actors Mishal Al Ali Al Sabea and Khaled Sami who did a good job within the limits of their roles . after all Keif al even with all of its disadvantages still an OK movie and it is a very good step of Rotana and the movie became the speech of people and streets which is a golden goal to make a strong debates inside the Saudi society about movies in general until they become aware of the importance of the art and other arts'' PS there is another Saudi filmmaker Abdullah Almohaisen'' claims that he directed the Saudi movie titled Shadows of Silence'' have n't seen the movie yet hope I've been helpful .

Marion manages to get his fingerprints and takes it to the police and when the identity is confirmed that it was in fact her brother Brian she and Bob leave for New York after tracing his whereabouts . They get a hold of Brian but still he does n't know what they are talking about but all the couple really want to know is where Brian has their maybe year old son Joey . and even when they see Joey he does n't know them either . The plot thickens and they find themselves one day thinking that they are someone else as well . Experiments made out on people only to make the perfect assassins yet the question of why they would bother putting Bob and Marion in the same building as each other is beyond me . Personally Gregory Harrison played his parts great but have no clue what was wrong with the other actors they seemed bored and lost . out of a little suspense yes but that's it .
12340_4.txt,0, Rather like Paul Newman and Steve McQueen with their racing car movies this has all the appearance of a jollies'' project for Robert Redford as he gets to ski up hill and down dale in the Alpine sunshine . The story is as light as powdered snow with Redford's small boy David Chappellet kind of lead name is that ? who with his eyes on the prize of Olympic glory gets up the nose of in no particular order his coach father and team Women are a mere side in his insular world as evidenced by a fairly distasteful pick scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown and then his selfishly petulant pursuit of heavens above a free independent woman played by Camilla Sparv . The ski sequences are fine with some good stunt involving numerous bumps and scrapes on the piste but their effectiveness is dimmed by our subsequent familiarity with top TV coverage of skiing events down to the present day . Plus I'm not convinced that the Winter Olympics has the same mass identification with the general public as the summer games so that when Redford eventually wins his gold medal in the final reel could n't really be that excited for him one way or another . Of the actors Redford best profile forward does n't need to do much and indeed does n't while Gene Hackman does better with equally meagre material . Ms Sparv does well as the chief female interest well who treats Redford the way he's doubtless treated every other woman in his chauvinistic way . In truth though there's a lack of dramatic tension throughout for which the action sequences do n't fully compensate and you do n't care a fig for any of the leading characters . One of those films where the actors probably enjoyed making it more than the viewers did watching it .

First of all who in the late the film takes place like this family ? college professor would n't make enough money to support the lifestyle saw on the film . Hence he and his stay home wife would be plagued by financial woes especially when she gets cancer . Second Streep is my age and most women particularly in her class white well off experienced the feminist movement . Yet this woman seems oblivious to her anachronistic behavior . actually felt that she was a very controlling woman who kept her husband an emotional child by taking care of his every need . The fact that so many people were moved by the film is amazing . have admired Carl Franklin's films in the past and actually like Meryl Streep but gad what a manipulative and lying film this is .
6103_1.txt,0, This movie is best enjoyed amidst a large audience with the giggle Very frequently the characters in KADOSH are seen staring ahead intensely at nothing . Very intense unhappy faces very pensive very serious . During these moments there is very serious sounding music just to make doublely sure the viewer realizes that the scene being watched is not about fun and games . The more entertaining portions of this film come in between the many pensive stares . We learn that the women of the KADOSH community have two duties . One is to breed as many male babies as possible for their husbands . The second is to stay employed so to free their husbands from having to work . What do these men do with their ample free time ? They pray . And we learn that at home they pray out loud give you thanks for not creating me as a woman . And at their place of worship they pray to give thanks for possessing functioning male genitalia . Along with the praying there are many scenes of frenzied antics screaming and endless head bobbing and bodies rocking back and fourth and mixed in with everything are many intricate and bizarre simple but just as odd ritualistic activities . The cream of the unintentional comedy comes from the sex . The imagery of an hot and bothered man actively exchanging body fluids with his wife in bed while attempting to keep his beanie from falling off his scalp is unforgettable ! Every sex scene is funny but one that stands out is when a husband rubs his face against his beautiful wife's Abecassis feet . Oh yes we are finally entering the land of sensuality . but NO ! The feet rubbing stops before anything happens and the husband begins his autistic looking head bobbing and body rocking until the scene ends ! There are three attractive females in near states of undress however KADOSH contains absolutely no nudity . Technically there is some interesting imagery and pleasing uses of light and colors by the director . For a more believable educational and entertaining treatment of the plight of being an unclean female unworthy of holding a book in a world where respect is measured by the speed by which a man can cite a phrase from ancient writings suggest Barbra Streisand's YENTL .
11606_4.txt,0, Mr. and Mrs. Smith'' is one of the not too well known early American Hitchcock's movie . But if Lifeboat'' unfortunately also belongs to this category is an underrated masterpiece not all the movies signed by the master of suspense in that time early are really worth seeing . And to tell the truth not discovering this film is n't really a lost . Mr. and Mrs. Smith'' is an average and conventional screwball comedy where it's rather hard to find the Hitchcock's touch . Maybe you can catch a glimpse of his shadow is n't much in the cruelty that Carole Lombard is sometime capable of it's well hidden in an impersonal package in a vertigo scene where two of the characters are trapped on top of a trade fair attraction and maybe in the character of the mother . And that's about it Even for the Hitchcock fan there is little to connect with . And for the screwball comedies amateur there is n't very much more none of the situation are exaggerated enough for being really funny and we're far from the masterpieces of Hawks for instance . And if one or two scene are quite amusing there're not even the funniest in Hitchcock's filmography who created comical situations in almost all his movies Psycho'' could be considered full of very dark humor So there is really little to save in this movie that can without annoying anyone maybe only both hardcore fans of Hitchcock and screwball comedy who are in love with Carole Lombard stays one of the not too well known early American Hitchcock's movie .
8683_4.txt,0, In this Silly Symphony a mouse from the country visits his cousin in the city . Most of the short is the two mice exploring the dinner table . The animation is fine where this short suffers is in a lack of humor . Perhaps I've just seen this dinner table adventure'' in one too many Tom and Jerry shorts . Even though this came first just did n't find it that enjoyable .
3698_4.txt,0, This is the kind of movie that BEGS to be shown on TV at or in the morning if at all . No doubt the film responsible for Attack of the Foot Woman'' thought they were making a pertinent statement about women and philandering and the dangers of the demon rum all wrapped up in a sci allegory . Or maybe it was a tax write Either way Attack'' proves best for the viewer under the following circumstances extreme intoxication seen on a double with any of those Jacqueline Suzanne movies Once is Not Enough'' or just a night when you feel insecure and the world around you is a little too perfect . Pop in Attack'' and you'll feel great guaranteed ! It's good for a laugh at the expense of the hokey script the rubbery special FX and that four sheriff . And think the last line should be engraved in a monument somewhere in Washington it's just that memorable . Four stars for Attack of the Foot Woman'' buy a copy mail it to Gloria Steinem she'll love you for it .

Dora the explorer of the OK i'll admit it . as a kid barney was my ultimate hero . had my barney plush toy and used to watch the same barney episodes over and over on videotape . maybe cause it was so sugar coated and mind However by the time turned started to hate barney . everyone at school would Dis barney and went along with it because it was funny and it's what little boys do . but a few years later discovered something else about barney that will never forget . person known on the IMDb as Angel did an Essay for school explaining the dangers of watching barney and he or she posted it in the message boards . a lot of those dangers made sense . Barney is a dinosaur who can magically come to life during a day at school . he is supposedly educational or so Sheryl Leach Creator says but really all can remember him teaching me is that magic can solve anything which is not true . to end off this comment I'd like to tell you a little story . There was once a young boy who watched a particular episode of barney . one day he was alone when a stranger lured him into his car and drove away with him . do n't know the outcome it's safe to assume the child died but why was he abducted in the first place ? because he watched the Barney and friends episode titled stranger is a friend you have n't met yet .
1657_4.txt,0, Very slow dull enigmatic film . MAybe the kind of film Jean Godard would have made had he been Italian . Certainly conveys how tedious repetitious joyless and empty a person's life can be but do n't usually go to the cinema to find that out ! The plot as it is does n't convince . Why a gorgeous hotel receptionist exception to the dullness of the film would be the slightest bit interested in a moody chain silent loner who speaks in aphorisms baffles me . Very difficult to feel any sympathy with the main character . One feels like shaking him by the throat and telling him to out of it ! His brother is a much more human character . The ending is inconclusive and puzzling . Everyone in the cinema saw the film went out muttering about how they nearly fell asleep . Of course it should n't have to be a Hollywood Bruce Willis and fiesta but a little bit of energy and action would have made it a lot more thrilling . One of the best Italian films ever ? Pleease . art curiosity at best .
11029_3.txt,0, This film does n't have a very clear picture of what it is or wants to be . There are some good bits when Stewart is on screen and they give him some lines to work with . It works best early on as romantic comedy but the story keeps heading for more dramatic territory and gets itself lost in the process . By the last fifteen minutes or so the plot twists are just a series dramatic clich The part with the airplane feels like some leftover footage from another film spliced in . The main reason can think of to watch it is if you want be able to say you've seen all of Jimmy Stewart's films .
12218_4.txt,0, The real problem with this story is that there's not much story to the story . There's hardly any plot to speak of . Widower buys an electric grandma for his kids . One kid resists electric grandma . Then finally accepts her . Then the kids grow up and grandma leaves . Really very little happens . It's much more of a premise than a story . Moreover strip it of it's schmaltz and you have a story that had already done before and better The Lonely . Same basic idea person initially ca n't accept the love of a robot because it's just then eventually yields and comes to love the robot . The biggest difference is that The Lonely is much more powerful as both the protagonist and we the audience are shocked abruptly back to reality and forced to remember that in the end the robot really is just a mechanism . also find the story highly flawed in that the electric grandmother is just perfect . She's not only human'' she's She's than a real person she has no traces of mechanicalness to her at all and she makes marbles appear out of thin air . It frankly really chafes at credulity to think that she's a machine .
4970_3.txt,0, saw the trailers of this movie and found the cinematography and what was presented interesting . saw the IMDb rating and confirmed it to be an above average movie . Thus went to see it . The story is about Mandy Lane Heard a beautiful girl in high school who is a subject of male sexual desire . Mandy's friend Emmet's Welch provocation to another fellow student to show his love for Mandy leaves the fellow student drunk and jump down to death . Nine months pass and Mandy is invited for a summer weekend to a secluded ranch by her teenager friends three girls and three boys go there ! There is a security guard Garth Mount who works at the ranch . During the first night itself the killings take place one by one the members of the group are killed . Who is behind the killings ? wont tell here to spoil sports'' Did like the movie ? NO . After usual interesting opening the movie takes a downward turn with every unfolding of event . By half when the killer is revealed one looses all interest in the remaining proceedings . There is a last twist in the tale to shock viewers but rather it made me shake the head in dis and laugh ! All this for suspense ? Huh'' Amber Heard acts and plays her role well as a shy and conscious girl who is aware of her beauty and men's desire for her . The remaining cast are usual nothing to say about . There are so many movies made of teenager boys and girls going to a secluded place and slowly someone killing them one by one that it does not interest me anymore . Director Jonathan Levine tries hard to make the movie interesting by using contemporary chat talks of teenagers loaded with sexual overtones but does not allow the movie to rise above the mundane . The only and the most appealing saving grace of the movie is its cinematography by Darren Genet who captures beautiful picture perfect images ! out of
11897_3.txt,0, One would think that anyone embarking upon a followup to the groundbreaking Naked Civil Servant of years ago would at the very least try to honor the original with some kind of inspired vision but no . Here we have a sort of biopic of one of the most stylish people of the late century that itself boasts no style whatsoever . True the filmmakers have assembled some outstanding actors and handed them a chipped mug of drab gruel to work with . Everything in the infrastructure of this film is wrong starting with the script which is another one of those TV condensations of great lives wherein every other line is a famous quote'' by the subject and every other scene is an in introduction to the next pivotal character in the subject's life . We get Swoozie Kurtz as a PR maven who promotes Crisp as a stateside entertainer Denis O'Hare as the editor of a gay periodical who hires Crisp as film reviewer becomes somewhat alienated from him when he appears indifferent to the passions of AIDS activists and then returns to the fold as a compassionate friend of the dying octogenarian Jonathan Tucker a fine performance as a shy insecure painter of gay canvases who is befriended by Crisp and finally Cynthia Nixon as performance artist and Woman Penny Arcade who intrigued by Crisp's persona offers him a spot in her traveling cabaret act . Nixon is a persuasive and gifted performer but is given no chance by the script to embody the down and streetwise Arcade . Crisp spent the last years of his life in a one flat in an old tenement building in Manhattan's East Village . He famously said that he never cleaned because after a few years the dust does n't get any worse or something like that . But looking at the depiction of that flat in this film you'd never get the flavor of that dustiness . He frequented a local coffee shop on a busy avenue and would be seen pretty much each day of the week sipping tea and watching the world go by . In this film we get a diner that looks like something on Avenue by the Hudson River . Most of the streets of New York'' scenes have a sterile unreal look with no sense of the period . The soul of this film is the great John Hurt in the title role . After nearly years he can still grasp the essence of this peculiar post Englishman and put it across to third millennarians . His every line every gesture is exquisite . In the later scenes he even modulates his vocal projection to suit that of a person whose life is winding down toward death . Crisp wrote shortly before he left this realm that when one grows very very old one's skin takes on the character of a smelly overcoat that can not be removed and one longs for death . One senses that feeling in Hurt's performance . So for him and him alone this film is worth a look .
3620_4.txt,0, I'm not going to lie and say do n't watch the show do . BUT it has a lot and a lot of flaws . The Boarding School is perfect . The drama is at a minimum . Everyone is so nice to each other you know . Lets give that a reality check . Its IMPOSSIBLE that ANY school is perfect like PCA . Free laptops for everyone . Big dorm rooms . Mini fridges . If there was a school like that in real life almost nobody there would be a virgin for one . Two everyone there is so rich and its weird how nobody has anything stolen yet . Characters really unrealistic . First things first who in they're right minds talk like they do . They talk like a perfect teenager would . Secondly Logan Reese Underwood is an extremely rich boy hot'' teenage boy . My question is why is n't almost ever girl in that school all over him ? He's rich and hot'' now a days all those girls would be after him even if he was a jerk . Also Chase is the most stupidest person ever . He is this shy teenager who claims to not be in love with Zoey and over to everything that involves Zoey . She must be BLIND not to see him in love with her . Come on Nick . know you can do better than THAT . Please .
7258_4.txt,0, THE DEADLY MANTIS certainly wo n't scare any one but as sci programmers go it is better than most . volcanic eruption at the south pole thaws out a giant prehistoric preying mantis at the north pole . Military men go missing . Dr. Ned Hopper Hopper's son and best known as Paul Drake on television's PERRY MASON is called in to the creature by this time the creature has eaten up several Eskimo and is en route to the Washington Monument . About a third or more of the film consists of stock footage old government educational films military men in radar rooms air planes would you believe Eskimos putting out to sea ? Which explains of course why a tribe of Eskimo is attacked in the movie . Guys ! Think we can work this in ? Mix in some negligible special effects some clunky dialogue and some sexist attitudes and you're good to go . Not as original as THE MONSTER THAT CHALLENGED THE WORLD but fans of big bug'' schlock will enjoy it the kids will have a good time throwing popcorn at the screen .

3313_4.txt,0, Specks of white and various shapes a beautiful nude random images . That is what this little experimental short film is . It's kind of interesting to think how in the early days of film such images could be transferred onto film but despite my love of a lot of surreal images and films and a fascination with the bizarre this film just did n't do it for me . I'm not sorry watched it but if there is any underlying meaning in it do n't get it . Visually it is not that outstanding in my humble opinion . As an example of dadaism suppose it would fit in quite well since it seems to reject any semblance of logic or reason though would have preferred that it do it in a more visually interesting way . But to each his own .

I'll only mention one of my favorite elements the underwater shots'' of the fish'' swimming'' The sound which accompanies those shots is great too . One last note William Katt is actually a pretty decent actor . hope he gets another day in the sun watching him as The Greatest American Hero'' was a fun part of my childhood a couple of decades ago and he has n't been very visible since . He seemed kind of depressed in this movie . Somebody give him a fun job on a good show or something .
11191_4.txt,0, Some movies you'll watch because they touch your soul or challenge you in ways that grow . Some you'll watch because you want to be exposed to adventure or shock outside your experience these wo n't directly feed you but they'll help you situate yourself in a larger world than you otherwise would have . And after all the hard parts of life are in what you choose not to accept . And then there are movies that do neither of these things that you will watch out of obligation or because you have a need for historical context . These are pretty worthless experiences in terms of building a life . The problem is of course that often you do n't know which of the three a film will be going in . You might get some indication from people you trust but because a life in film is so personal you really wo n't know until you go on the blind date . For me this was pretty worthless . Yes yes know for many Bunuel is the epitome of the sublime and rich . And you should know you do n't that among my greatest film experiences are some very strange films very strange indeed . It is n't that this is n't cinematic or symbolically deep or apolitically friendly to the way think . Its how it gets there that is off base . Its the deviance from real deviance that annoys me . Part of the problem is that this is successful alternative art which means that it is successful commercial art . Which in turn means that it can be simply explained and the explanation is not only widely acceptable but simply coded in shorthand . Surely all this is true . When the term surreal'' is used generally it is used incorrectly to denote any film image or world that differs from reality or seems strange . But when it is used correctly meaning according to consensus theory it always revolves around Bunuel and in particular this film and the one he genuinely did with Dali . So because they invented surreal cinema they define and control the term . That by itself chafes me and have my own alternative definition that does n't come from their philosophy . Its because the philosophy is wholly contrary . It is n't a philosophy at all but a rejection of philosophy an anti Its packaged anarchy carefully selecting the things that they use and the things they oppose without clearly differentiating them . So okay against linearity against narrative against history against religion easy one against deliberate love . But for an illinear linear narrative for establishing its own history by countless film school professors what else can they do ? for a sort of transcendent accidental'' love . It is its own enemy . If there were a Bunuel alive today as he sold his image the first thing he would do is attack the church or the surreal . My regular readers know that in nearly all matters cinematic cleave to the Spanish and avoid the French . But in the matter of the surreal I'd like to you consider the reverse get your surrealism from Alfred Jarry not Bunuel . Ted's Evaluation of Has some interesting elements .
1610_4.txt,0, The storyline of The Stranger'' mirrors somewhat the film Journey to the Far Side of the Sun'' by Gerry Sylvia Anderson of and fame parallel Earth is the premise of both films . But there is a difference . Where the world in The Stranger'' features a totalitarian regime out to squash the freedom of the citizenry Journey to the Far Side of the Sun'' merely showed a true mirror world where handwriting roads houses machinery of every kind and of course internal organs were all in reverse mirrored order . So the similarity of parallel Earths is the only connection of both films . Similarly the TV series Land of the Giants'' came before both of those films having run from to It featured a world that was nearly parallel to the Earth with the exception that the planet was populated by giants times the size of the humans who crash there . The idea of a totalitarian government out to capture and contain the people was similar to the premise of The Stranger'' more than the premise of JTTFSOTS'' Perhaps because of the similarly to LOTG'' a series to The Stranger'' was shelved . Had it turned into a TV series it would have been a sci version of The Fugitive with star Glenn Corbett being chased by the baddies from week to week hiding out in different locations etc . BTW a stronger script could have helped this film along .
3647_1.txt,0, Just do a little research on the making of this film . Something so simple as a Google search . It was funded by the US Army and promoted just in time for the elections . It is a great idea but I'd much rather see a DOCUMENTARY not something edited by the Bush Administration and told its reality . The timing of the movie's release its tone and the fact that MS promoted it raised questions about the intent of the movie . According to MS Managing Director Joe Gleason he and his colleagues also deliver key targeted messages about the war in Iraq to specific constituencies wrote Eartha Melzer . Was the left art house crowd one of those constituencies ? Is the government hiring documentary filmmakers to propagandize the population ? Nobody involved with the film is willing to say who initially put up the money for the film or how they ended up represented by the Army's PR firm .

South Park was right about FG dead on when they brought up the Manatees and the idea balls .

Not something a mass audience would go for but if you're like these characters they show you'll love it to pieces . Overall this is a comedy that the snobs at the BBC will sit back and laugh at for their pleasure and only a select few of the publics . Comparing it to BBC Comedys like Only Fools and Horses Fawlty Towers Black Adder and other classics this series tends to drift away from the BBC's regular product to the audience and deliver to somewhat of a folk culture .

Let me see now guy who had earlier skied down Mount Fuji manages to accumulate the funding and hire personnel to document what sounds on the surface like a bold and daring act ski down the world's highest peak . Well HERE COMES THE SPOILER happens see after a large crew of people manage to help him get near the top a life is lost in the bargain gets on his skis manages to make it down a very very short way at which point his PARACHUTE OPENS . that's that . And instead of burning the footage to hide this amazingly anticlimactic ending to an embarrassing debacle the guy goes ahead and releases it . SPOILER ENDS do admire the amazing courage and effort it must have taken the film crew to get some of the stunning shots they got . ANOTHER SPOILER yes one of the Sherpas is killed by falling into a crevasse . The narrator who is quoting the daredevil skier casually remarks that according to the Sherpa religion since this man's body can not be recovered his soul will roam the world forever and never know rest . Is it worth it the narrator muses . YES he answers it served the purpose of letting this clown ski down Everest . ca n't remember ever seeing a more meretricious piece of celluloid . This is one to miss at all costs .
5718_2.txt,0, After a long hard night being partied away at the Walkabout in Islington needed a pick My throat hurt my wallet was empty and ended up chatting to a drug addict at a bus trying to sell me some petrol . Today watched Red Sonja'' and can honestly say that felt much better last night than do right now . Brigitte Nielsen leads a bunch of ass warriors in various shapes and sizes to recover a green rock from some evil queen whose motives are never fully explained . Yep it's that good . Red Sonja'' is n't in a genre known for great films until Peter Jackson came along with a certain Oscar trilogy . In fact the best swords film could think of before Lord Of The Rings'' was George Lucas's kiddie Willow'' Perhaps in view of this one should go a little easy on this film . But ca n't it's poorly written badly acted the exception of Paul Smith who's just average and dreadfully put together . The film is as convincing as an episode of the Flintstones with costumes and scenery seemingly lifted straight outta Bedrock . Considering the comic source material it is easy to forgive the various plot inconsistencies . Why Sonja insists on saving the most annoying kid in this world or that one is bewildering . His personality seems to flick from spoilt brat to polite gentleman at the flick of a switch . Schwarzenegger displays less charisma than a field full of cows and just goes through the motions a perfect actor for his breakthrough role in The Terminator'' It's simple to kick a film when you're down but the fact remains that this is not a good film by any stretch of the imagination . When Nielsen mourns the death of her sister and Schwarzenegger tenderly places his hand on her shoulder to comfort her and then blurts out in that distinctive Germanic accent she's dead'' then you know you're in for a rough ride . few smiles were raised at inappropriate points such as the priestesses of a temple who when sent plunging to their deaths in a hole in the ground seemed to enjoy the experience at least judging from the orgasmic moans that seemed to echo around the place . If you have to watch an Eighties fantasy film that was n't porn watch Willow'' never take that as a ringing endorsement For the real thing take yourself to your local multiplex and show Peter Jackson what a great job he did with Lord Of The Rings'' Trust me Oscars really does mean it's a great film unlike bloody Titanic''

Maybe in when it came out and reality TV did n't have such a dominant presence in the industry this movie would have seemed entertaining . But Mike and Mark are so obviously playing themselves Mike and Mark . At times they are funny and some of the lines seem off the cuff but mostly they do not ring true .

5915_4.txt,0, Produced at a point in his career where he had the juice to do whatever he wanted Eddie Murphy took on the task of producing directing co and starring in HARLEM NIGHTS an expensive but ultimately empty gangster saga about a group of black nightclub owners running a ritzy club during the headed by a wisecracking hot shot Murphy his adopted father Pryor and their attempts to avoid being overrun by white gangsters who think they are taking over turf that it seems they think is rightfully theirs simply by virtue of their color . This was an idea that probably looked great on paper but it definitely lost something in the translation . This was a vanity piece for Eddie and think he spreads himself a little too thin here trying to be the whole show here . Admittedly it was a pleasure seeing Murphy and Pryor together on screen but the rest of the large supporting cast including Arsenio Hall Redd Foxx Della Reese Michael Lerner Danny Aiello Jasmine Guy Thomas Mikal Ford Stan Shaw and Eddie's brother are really given precious little to do will admit Murphy's fight scene with Della Reese is hysterically funny and probably the movie's best scene Murphy clearly poured a lot of money into this film and a good deal of it shows on screen . The art and set direction are impressive and the breathtaking costumes should have won an Oscar but this one was a big miss for Eddie as he definitely tried to wear too many hats .
2891_4.txt,0, Additionally titled BURNING MAN and FLASH FIRE for its various releases this Australian made film shot in New South Wales is problematic for its producers from its outset due to several personality conflicts and extended shooting time that prematurely uses up its allocated budget and although the storyline is at times nicely detailed below standard post finishing and overmuch cutting jettisons the affair . Tom Skerritt plays as Howard Anderson an American entrepreneur with a passion for building'' who is in process of erecting a tourist hotel in the Blue Mountains region all the while unaware that his business partner Julian Fane Doleman has insured the incomplete structure for ten million dollars far more than its actual worth and plans its destruction as corollary to normal summer brush fires in order to collect a handsome sum through fraud . In line with this illicit scheme Fane arranges for an arsonist to perform the incendiary deed a young man who also happens to be the boyfriend of Anderson's daughter and due to the future resort's being in the midst of a critical fire hazard sector of the many unexplained elements of the screenplay Julian has every expectation that his dastardly design will come about without serious hindrance . As the local insurance firm victimized by the crime is majority owned by Fane the policy's naturally skeptical underwriters Lloyd's of London deploy senior investigator George Engels Mason to probe into the nature of the felony made more sinister because of the death possibly a homicide of an insurance investigator Hughes who in following clues was apparently coming close to the cause of the arson . The setting for the film is the week before Christmas capstone of summer in the Antipodes a dramatic background but the links within the story are not smoothly compounded resulting in the presentation of events that are rather difficult for a viewer to follow a problem heightened by erratic editing the mentioned heavy cutting and poor sound and picture quality . Skerritt's semi and droning style is fatally invalidated by this dim sound processing but Mason is very effective as ever and enjoys the best dialogue with Hughes impressive as the too early written investigator Doleman wins acting laurels with his performance as the malevolent Julian Fane .

Overall this is a good adaption if you can look beyond the slow story in places and look beyond some of the cheesy romance and dialogue . In my opinion a perfect Iliad film version has not yet been created but this one is entertaining and does have some good bits .
11700_4.txt,0, This story had a good plot to it about four elderly men that share a deadly secret concerning a young woman that they met years ago . After all this time the young woman returns to seek revenge on the men . This story occasionally made me nod off during the movie in the middle of tiring elevator music and the ever so consistent thunder storms . But it is well worth the wait in the end when we find out just who the mystery woman is that keeps plaguing the old men in their dreams and interfering in a young man's life . The most of what liked in this film was the suspense in which the young woman appears to the men just before their deaths . The special effects were something . Every time heard her call out to them would think Not that face again . But it was a good movie just wish that the pace was not as slow or the acting not as tiresome . And what also liked about the movie was the flashback of the very authentic as well as the costumes being original .

Also back then we listened to things called CD players . But digress . used to like this movie a lot way back then and up till viewing it again I've held reaally fond memories of it . Hey it's Don Bluth ! Anyone who hates All Dogs Go to Heaven'' is clearly a robot . But again digress . Then saw it again . This really is n't one of his best can say now eleven years later . I've seen a lot more films and I've garnered a little bit more knowledge . Now sure the voice acting is good I'll give that . Story's . mean we see it all the time . LOT . But it works . The musical numbers are what irk me . This would've been more at home in the eighties with these kind of musical numbers . In most kids movies had epic numbers like the Lion King came out a year or so previous but whatever stuff like that . You get showtunes here vaudeville style . The animation kind of hurts too . At times choppy and at others completely changing style and format with the change of a shot it's really hard not to notice . still like All Dogs Go to Heaven but this could've been waaay better .
11394_4.txt,0, The recent documentary The Adventures of Errol Flynn'' is an in look at the Ultimate Hollywood Hero . Bogart Wayne and the like were basically blue collar types in their screen images but Flynn was an aristocrat in his style and manner the younger son out to carve out his own fiefdom for a sword and romance analogy that ironically he found himself trapped in . If he had n't been under contract to Warner Bros. he would've of been perfect in the Cary Grant role in Suspicion the good looking charmer whose watt smile blinds one to the fact that he's a predator . And he could've starred with his best leading ladies sister Joan Fontaine . That was Flynn's trouble he was the Ultimate Screen Hero until his own habits and bad timing caught up with him . Grant and Flynn in a way are similar but Flynn was the more macho of the two is possible to see Grant as Captain Blood but Flynn in The Philadelphia Story Mr. Blanding Builds his Dream House Monkey Business Operation Petticoat would've turned those roles on their collective ears because he's too damn sure on his feet and the sexual tension he would've brought naturally would've made the story lines wobbly . But this wobbly biography is just a plasticized view of Flynn and his era . There are times when half expected a laugh track or an audience to go Ahhh'' at some point . It does n't go deeply into Flynn's life just the screen magazine view . It also does n't delve into his struggle to be considered more than a derring Like the cleaned up biographies of Lon Chaney the father the Wolfman Lenny'' Mice and Men and Buster Keaton done in the this is just a time killing piece of fluff
1751_4.txt,0, just recently viewed Shame which is directed by Ingmar Bergman . The film was interesting and very unique . liked how it was in Swedish with English subtitles and that it was also in black and white . These features allowed me to better relate to the characters the time period and their stories . did n't like how the movie was very slow in the beginning and how you did n't know what was really going on . At first it was mainly a story of Eva and Jan's relationship . The movie also ended on a very depressing note because nothing good came out of all of the conflicts and changes throughout the movie . probably would not go see Shame again but it was a very cultured experience .
412_2.txt,0, went into the movie expecting a little action mixed with a strong story line . understand that changes between written works and movies must be made . many reasons . The changing of the relationship between the scientists they were father daughter in the book The Director of CERN was eliminated thus causing the scene between the Carmelengo and the Director to be changed to the Carmelengo and the head of the Swiss Guard in the Pope's office . Ron Howard made sure to get his dad inserted as a Cardinal with a hayseed accent but missed all the symbolism . Both Lagdon and the Carmelengo ascended to the heavens in the helicopter with Hanks character landing in the river and the priest landing upon the chapel in what was described as a Christ image . At some point this film needs to be remade by a director who is up to the job

During a dinner discussion of the incident the lights go out and when they come back on they discover that one of the guests has been killed . Fearing for their lives the guests attempt to find out the secrets behind the death before others can occur according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . There are a couple of clever twists in this murder at the Old Dark House'' story with the Play within a Play'' being its most interesting feature . However the direction is rather ordinary which serves to highlight a certain cheapness of production . Like most movies of this type there is should be an ensemble of intriguing characters . Herein only old Broadway producer Richard Carle Herman Wood and his fey secretary Johnny Arthur Homer Erskine maintain interest .

9700_4.txt,0, While the new Pride Prejudice film is gorgeous to view and the soundtrack is lovely we are not seeing Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice . The film is for some reason set back in the early rather than the Regency period where the novel is set as scholars have long shown . The Bennets Longbourn estate is ram and looks like Cold Comfort Farm . Yet the Bennets in the novel are gentry class they own a farm but the pig does not walk through the house nor is the farmyard of manure and chicken droppings contiguous to the home . Scenes are re from the novel lest we forget Jane Austen placed scenes in certain locations for a reason . For example the film puts the big Darcy proposal scene outside in a storm in front of a Neoclassical temple as opposed to inside the Collins parsonage Why did Jane Austen put it in the parsonage ? Because while Lizzy and Darcy speak with total if brutal honesty to each other in this scene the Collinses have never shared an honest word . Why the rain and the outdoor proposal ? It looks like Jane Eyre meeting Rochester ! And when Elizabeth walks across a windy field to stand on a cliff and view the panorama one expects her to cry Heathcliffe'' at any minute ! Austen has been Bronteized ! Judy Dench is a GREAT actress but Lady Catherine is supposed to be tall and striking . The petite Tom Hollander is a brilliant actor but Mr. Collins is described in the novel as tall and heavy which suggests that his terrible dancing with poor Lizzy is elephantine . Matthew MacFayden is another favorite of mine from MI on in however he is more the young Heathcliffe never smiling Austen observes in the novel that Darcy smiles at Lizzy quite a bit and she realizes this when she sees his wonderful smiling portrait at Pemberley portrait that in this movie is for some reason replaced by a sculptured marble bust . much of Austen's dialogue is changed to modern speech . Mr. Bingley has been turned into such a clown that one wonders why Darcy would have him as a friend and why Jane Bennet would love him . The bottom line is that while this is a great movie to watch and hear it deviates from Jane Austen's novel so much that any student who watched it thinking she could substitute viewing for reading would fail !
10442_2.txt,0, Now out of all the shark movies I've seen this one takes the cake ! The plot of the movie was good but the excitement factor sort of took a nosedive afterwards . Antonio Sobato Jr. does an excellent role as a son who seeks the shark who killed his father . megaldon is one of the biggest sharks of all and the most dangerous one as well . The view of the shark was indeed scary in some angles but the effects were a blur and the scenes were a little weak in some places . With the mini weapons there that would take out a whole school of sharks there . It was great that the son would get the exact revenge on that monstrosity although it would indeed cost him his life as well . Like they say revenge has it's price but was it worth it ? That answer could go on and on and this movie was a major letdown . The beginning was fine and at the end it went like the Titanic . OUT OF STARS !

Byrl Ives is convincing as the tyrannical patriarch an egomaniac who swears to see his birthday . His wild dancing at a party he gives for his neighbors will make anyone take notice guy is SEVETY SIX ? Always mumbling Bible verses he demands respect while driving sons and friends away with his self rantings and emotional cruelties . The love affair between Perkins and Loren at first appears absurd but becomes believable near the end . There is plenty of drama but not enough to feel good about . Clearly written for the stage this story was dated even when it was filmed . Perkins whistles My Bonnie'' in the although the song was n't composed until Critics knocking Sophia Lorens command of the English language'' are rather petty . found her English flawless and completely audible . As a Neapolitan Loren speaks a distinct dialect that often had to be dubbed into proper Italian'' Her accent'' however hardly affects how she speaks English . As a first Generation German American can appreciate the efforts of those who learn English as a second or even third or fourth language . Desire Under The Elms'' is a drama even a tragedy in the Classic Sense . For my enjoyment is was missing a logical story and an overall pay off'' for the time invested . Fans of the stars wo n't want to miss it others however tune in at your own risk !

2743_1.txt,0, On the heels of the well received and beloved coming of age film classic the lives of teenagers as they headed into adulthood George Lucas American Graffiti we have Cooley High . An adaptation of sorts by one Eric Monte co creator of the popular CBS sitcom Good Times . Cooley High was and is viewed as a black version of American Graffiti . of central California in American Graffiti we have the black slum of Chicago's Cabrini Green as the backdrop for the story here . Instead of America in Cooley High is situated in movie stars Welcome Back Kotter's Hilton Jacobs and Glynn Turman as the movie main protagonists and its main characters . It has Garrett Morris playing the principal who tries to keep Jacobs and Turman's characters Coceise and Preach out of trouble a great deal of the time . You know would like to say that Cooley High is a worthy comparison piece to American Graffiti or that it is a great film on its own but ca n't . The problem lies with the fact that the producers of the film could n't or would n't hide the sad underside of black life in America . the film in the Cabrini Green part of Chicago does n't help things . Neither does the crass gross attempts at humor here . When Coceise is looking for a letter of intent from a college he finds his little brother has thrown down a toilet . When the gang visits the Chicago Zoo one of the gang named Pooter has manure thrown on him by an ape . When the Turman's character is being chased by two hoodlums in the school hangout dirty and depressing place to eat food in much less meet people at he opens the door of the girls bathroom while a girl is relieving herself as he escapes through the window of the same bathroom ! The high school the homes of the characters the bathrooms just about everywhere in the film displays the unfortunate look of urban decay and poverty . If that was n't enough there was the rough display of humor in the film . The use of violence and profanity in the film . Cooley High may be an coming of age film it is a hard and rough coming of age film with little or none of the wit and liking of the use of nostalgia that made people like and appreciate American Graffiti so much . Motown Records had a hand in making the film . The company's music was part of the film's soundtrack . But even here you get a sense of same old same old as one has heard these songs before a million times over . Not that they were n't great songs within themselves but black music that time period was more than just Motown . in Chicago . The song nearing the end of the movie by the Spinners Cameron was not all that impressive . There have been better Motown ballads that have been done by better Motown artists than Cameron without question . The last part of the film showing where the characters went to pay homage to the film Cooley High aimed to be Graffiti . It shows that Preach intelligent but underachieving student went to Hollywood and became a successful television writer . Eric Monte may have patterned himself as Turman's character . The last shot of film show's Preach running away from Coceise's funeral on a dark rainy afternoon and all the bleakness that Cooley High came to represent . Eric Monte Preach and that final scene had one little lesson for all of us when watching Cooley High and for the love of the past . Do n't look back .

The Film is still going on in my back but the few effects are really not enough to watch the whole time . think what they have done well are the animated sceneries with suns and Moons but its the only liked . There are no intelligent dialogs there ? But its a Great Film for everybody who loves Lara Croft or some other Girls in HOT For the directors Stop to try again PLEASE !
95_3.txt,0, I'm the type of guy who loves hood movies from New Jack City to Baby Boy to Killa Season from the grade to the Hollywood . but this movie was something different . am no hater and this movie was kinda enjoyable . but some bits were just weird . well the acting was n't to good compared to Silkk The Shockers performance in Hot Boyz good and Ice in new Jack and SVU the scene where Corrupt kills the wan na be Jamaican dude he says something and lights himself on fire burning both Ice and the other dude this kills the Jamaican however Ice is unharmed very similar to Ice's other movie Urban Menace stars both of these actors were Snoops character is supernatural however after this there is nothing suggested that Corrupt is like a demon . When MJ gets stabbed at first he struggling but after that he fights normally and was stabbed in the thigh OUT BLOOD . and when MJ confesses killing a cop cos the cop was beating up his friend Benny was weird Benny is n't introduced in this movie and the scene is n't in the film . it does hold weight to the fact why Corrupt wants to kill MJ but is still makes scratch your head . wen Jody writes a letter to Miss Jones character explaining what happened to them afterwords does n't mention what happen other main characters MJ and Lisa . the film did show the horror and poverty of the ghetto plagues the lives of Latinos and Blacks word wide a good part of the film even though the clip of the projects was re thousands of times . and the scene where Miles kills the Latino brother by crashing his bike at full speed wearing a helmet and running into my Latino brothers car would of killed him . the movie was similar to the film Urban Menace and half the actors were in both of these movies as well as the production team . it was OK tho . but me being from poverty love hood films however if do n't love em like do Do n't WATCH IT . only thing saving me from walking out is it reminded me of the first movie made which was made with dollars and my love of the genre .

Melinda Hamilton stars as Amy a girl who has had oral sex with a canine in the past on a lark . She struggles with telling her fianc John . Of course the truth does rear it's shaggy ugly head . The film deals with the fallout of said escapade . The movie is well by all save for perhaps Jack Plotnick as Dougie who never really felt like he mashed well with the picture . And the film while solid enough seems to miss it's mark a few times . Every single person in the film struggles with massive hypocrisy and all our a tad hard to relate to . Bobcat should be commended for doing something different as said before but different does not always equal good and this pales ever so slightly not to Goldthwaits own directorial debut the criminally misunderstood Shakes the Clown'' My Grade

Both movies depict crucial events in chinese history FMC in the century and TA the first unification of the whole chinese nation in the century bc . FMC succeds with memorable characters gorgeous cinematography convincing sets good acting and an interesting story . The Assassin fails on nearly every level the sets are great the cinematography is good and the few battle scenes are quite exciting But . pathos . Call me a cynic but too much is too much . If you felt that Saving Private Ryan was too pathetic be aware this here will make you sick .

5811_4.txt,0, fully agree with the previous reviewer . There's no chemistry between Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr and the focus of the film is on their relationship . Hedy Lamarr is n't at her best and Spencer Tracy appears to be naive simple and overly both in love and life an idealist role that played out best in Town If you can make it through the ridiculous crowd scene by the train station . rather slapstick and not worthy of any actor in the cast . Not the best acting on anybody's part . Miscast and mismatched . Story is empty and various and disenfranchised input is apparent . Hedy Lamarr is her absolutely stunning herself which is truly the best part of the film . Spencer Tracy ca n't match the sophistication of her beauty and wardrobe and the film does n't come off as believable for at least that reason .

The farmer's seafaring son soon arrives slowly realizing what he's up against and attempting to rally the rest of the residents to fight . Another lawlessness story with everybody under the thumb of the villain naturally holds all the cards Derivative and uncomfortable at times to watch with a long wait before our stoic hero finally gets his dander up . Sterling Hayden's half Swedish accent is a big problem though he cuts a sturdy sympathetic presence on the screen and almost makes the picture worth Director Joseph Lewis stages most of the scenes stiffly like a TV western and Gerald Fried's bugle score is no help though the rich black cinematography by Ray Rennahan is excellent . An independent production released via United Artists the film has a bizarre start with shots from the finale followed by shots from the movie's midsection yet it does have a certain needling power which most assuredly gets the viewer on Hayden's side . from

It's such a great way to sit back relax and escape the politics and world problems for a few hours . But this was not to be the case with this version of The Magnificent Seven . The casting and storyline of this series closely follow the Hollywood formula for politically correct entertainment good old get revisionist history where the guys must all be white male Confederate this case and preferably Christian it can somehow be worked into the script It's sad really .

Well he was wrong . They did such a slipshod job you'd thought it was written in a week . have found it that if a director loves the genre the movie will be good . Obviously Brady does not love the genre he is spoofing . This movie is a rancid piece of garbage not worth viewing so do n't see it !
2281_3.txt,0, By Oscar biopic about the late great singer Ray Charles . There is one exactly one great scene in It occurs during a flashback to Charles youth after the boy become completely blind . Running into the sharecropper house which he shares with his mother he trips over a chair and sprawls on the floor . He cries out for his mother she in keeping with her philosophy that a person should stand on their own two feet'' observes silently and pensively from the kitchen waiting to see if the boy can fall back on his own resources . The boy proves to be up to the challenge using his ears and memory to locate a kettle on a stove a nearby fire the grass blowing in the wind outside of a window the scuttling of a cricket across the plank floor . The movie pauses here it expands it breathes even if for only seconds . The scene is a much respite from Taylor Hackford's otherwise noisy film . By noisy'' I'm not referring to the music which is of course excellent . AM referring to the sound effects BOOMS ! preceding yet another flashback and the inane dialog speaking to you as a FRIEND Ray etc . On the visual side Hackford is equally and pointlessly flashy sepia filters over the camera lenses during the flashbacks whirling from the camera etc . etc . All the modern amenities . What a horrible cinematic style is displayed in a style all in wan na important'' movies from the past decade or so is stylistically very similar to this movie These gimmicks are employed to obfuscate the clich screenplay . Some of us wo n't be fooled . Some of us also are not quite prepared to accept Jamie Foxx's performance as anything more than superb mimicry . Granted Foxx eerily resembles Ray Charles he walks like Charles talks like Charles and even twitches like Charles . Foxx's imitation of the singer during live performance is technically perfect . I'm not begrudging Mr. Foxx his Oscar he deserved it . was a pretty weak field this year anyway . But one wonders if Foxx really UNDERSTANDS Charles . The actor does achieve one great moment when he insists on trying out the smack that his band are shooting up he registers if only for a brief moment a disgust at the unfairness of being blind and a life of darkness . The movie seems to want to dramatize the struggle within Charles between the bright salvation of music and the oblivion of heroin with his blindness as the battleground between those two compulsions . But the damn movie just wo n't take the time it bounces along from triumph to triumph never really pausing for any insight into the man . One has to STRETCH to find the dramatic tension one must supply the drama FOR the movie . One must in other words imagine a better movie than this one . In its rush toward a glorious conclusion introduces then dodges several excellent ideas for a movie his early days on the Chitlin Circuit'' his bold musical innovations for the Atlantic label the problem of his addiction to heroin the inevitable artistic compromises attendant upon overwhelming success the man's importance to the Civil Rights struggle on in the movie for oh about minutes of screen and much more . The filmmakers are too lazy to focus on any one of these elements . Two hours of watching a man overcome one adversity after another may make us feel good but such a movie is not necessarily a grand work of art . This sort of approach certainly provides no deeper insight into the film's subject and should n't insight be the real goal of a movie like this ? If had wanted a laundry of Ray Charles accomplishments I'd have simply Googled him . stars out of the extra stars strictly for the music .

With the slicked back blonde hair he certainly looked the part but he did n't really act the part well . There was none of the menace cruelty and in the end he came out looking like a grinning cheerleader keeping the meeting going . The real Heydrich would not have let the conference get out of control the way it did in the film . The best performance of all was undoubtedly Colin Firth who played Dr William Stuckart the man who wrote the Nuremberg race laws and who gave legal respectibility'' to everything the Nazis did . Firth's performance was stunning the main vocal opponent to what Heydrich was proposing . The best part of all was when he was verbally dressing down one of the Nazi thugs . The thug muttered I'll remember you'' and Firth replies you should ! I'm very well The film is historically accurate but let's boil it down to what it really is minutes of a group of men around a table discussing shouting and bragging . There's no excitement no real conflicts the brief argument It's just minutes of talking ! Same room same table same people . I'm not sure if the DVD is worth the money . for one felt short

Thirdly it is filmed in association with the New Zealand Film Commission . Fourthly a friend recommended it to me . However was utterly disappointed . The whole storyline is absurd and complicated with very little resolution . Pope's acting is fine but Owen is unfortunately under The other actors and actresses are all okay but am unfamiliar with them all . Aside from the nice riddles which are littered throughout the movie Pope and Owen this film is n't very good . So the moral of the story is . watch it unless you really want to .

8457_3.txt,0, Terror in the Aisles'' might look like the ultimate treat for horror fans but it has in fact very few to offer . Granted it presents a decent and versatile versatile ? selection of horror fragments that are considered classic but the point ? This documentary primarily aims for the horror public so we've pretty much seen all these clips already have n't we ? The only thing really praiseworthy about this project is the editing . If you're into scream chases by vile murderers and that sort of things Terror in the Aisles'' has some neat compilations of the most famous sequences . All these different scenes hang together by a lame wraparound story starring Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen sitting in a movie theater . In between two sequences the address the viewer and explain'' why we love horror so much . Those speeches naturally are soporific and rather obvious in our nature to be afraid bla bla and fail to understand why many people love the concept . This is worth a peek in case you're a loyal horror fan but it certainly is n't essential viewing . On the contrary in case you still have to see a classic genre title beware that bits and pieces of it here do n't spoil your future viewing . The main reason why overall disliked it is because it shamelessly ignores a lot of lesser known but fundamental titles endlessly focusing on Halloween'' This does result in a cool inside joke however when Donald Pleasance screams to the screen at his own character .

6014_4.txt,0, Had she not been married to the producer Jennifer Jones would not have been the most obvious choice for the leading female role in this tragic tale of an affair between an American soldier and an English nurse set against the backdrop of the First World War . Her British accent is not perfect and in the fifties it was unusual for a big romantic lead to go to an actress in her late thirties even one as attractive as Miss Jones especially when she was several years older than her leading man . There were a number of beautiful young British actresses in Hollywood around this time such as Audrey Hepburn Elizabeth Taylor Jean Simmons and Joan Collins any of whom might have been more convincing in the role but Miss Jones had one important attribute they all lacked namely a marriage certificate with David Selznick's name on it . In the event the film turned out to be such a turkey that they were doubtless grateful not to have it on their CVs . The film tells at great length the story of the romance between Frederick an American volunteer serving with the Italian Army as an ambulance driver and Catherine a nurse with the British Red Cross . After the Italian defeat at the battle of Caporetto Frederick is wrongly accused of being a German spy and sentenced to death . film paints a very harsh picture of Italian military justice it would appear that Italian Courts had the power to pass the death sentence after a trial lasting all of thirty seconds without hearing any evidence and without allowing the defendant to be legally represented or to speak in his defence Frederick manages to escape and to cross the border into neutral Switzerland accompanied by the pregnant Catherine . Hemingway's novels have not always been a great success when filmed . Howard Hawks succeeded in making a good version of To Have and have Not'' a film that is considerably better than the book on which it is nominally based but that is because he largely ignored Hemingway's plot and turned the film into a remake of Casablanca'' set in Martinique rather than French Morocco . Like the version of For Whom the Bell Tolls'' Farewell to Arms'' is overlong and fatally slow moving . It is also miscast . Jennifer Jones never makes Catherine come to life . As for Rock Hudson his assumed Christian name could be unfortunately appropriate . He could be as solid as a rock but also as impassive as one and in this film his Frederick seems an impersonation of the Great Stone Face . Despite the passion and emotion inherent in Hemingway's plot the emotional temperature is always far too cool . The picture has little going for it apart from some attractive picture views of Italian and Swiss scenery . It is hardly surprising that it was not a success and that its failure ended Selznick's career as a producer . goof . Shortly before the battle of Caporetto an Italian officer states that Russia had already concluded a separate peace with Germany . That battle started in October at a time when Kerensky's Russia was still fighting alongside the Allies . The Russian Revolution did not take place until November it was only the October Revolution'' by the old Julian calendar . The new Bolshevik regime signed an armistice with Germany in December but a separate peace was not signed until the Treaty of Brest in March
4898_4.txt,0, The brilliant Australian comic genius Barry Humphries had a rare failure with this uneven and occasionally distasteful comedy which was snatched back from release after only a few days . Drunken lecherous Australian diplomat Sir Les Patterson accidentally sets an Arab potentate on fire at the UN and is posted to his tiny country as punishment arriving just as a palace coup puts a new leader soap star Thaao Penghlis on the throne . Sir Les with the reluctant help of Dame Edna Everage played by Humphries almost accidentally foils a scheme by the new leader to release a deadly disgusting AIDS virus on the Western World . Joan Rivers has a cameo as the female President of the United States her desk plate reading President Rivers'' Extreme bad taste mingles with slapstick and Humphries usual scathing satire in a film which is more enjoyable in it's many funny parts than taken together as a whole . Dame Edna's TV fans may be puzzled by the presence of a different Madge Allsop sadly one who lacks Emily Perry's wonderful drab comedy magic in the role . The film was written By Humphries his third wife Diane Millstead and directed by the Mad Max man himself George Miller . For die Humphries fans like myself essential . All others beware .
9497_3.txt,0, love Ustinov's distinctive literate narration . And the photography is quiet nice . We put the film on for our year old who sort of wandered in and out of the room . So for our first viewing we only saw about of the movie and were quite charmed . When we re sitting down for family time were all mortified at the violence and life situations the poor otter got into . About halfway through the movie there's a rack of dead bloody furry animals . Lots of blood not just a little . Then at the end there's a wild struggle with a dog then blood clouds the water . You'd think given the rating that's all you'll see . they will IMPLY one of the animals died . Nope . They drag the carcass out of the water and show it plainly for several traumatizing seconds . Personally as an adult love horror movies and am fine with violent movies ala Scorsese Cronenberg Tarantino . Heck love the ultra violent Battle Royale . But those are n't kid movies and do n't advertise themselves as such . If you are deliberately raising your young ones to see the harsh realities of life for cute animals then this is the movie for you . If you are like me and my wife though you might want to spare your child nightmares and avoid this one .
11179_4.txt,0, Matt Cvetic is a loyal communist in a Pittsburgh steel mill who works to recruit workers into the party even though this isolates himself from his son family and neighbors . What makes this even more difficult is that Cvetic is actually an FBI agent posing as a Communist in order to obtain information about party activities . The party is trying to create a strike at the mill whereby the pro movement will lead the workers into a wave of propaganda . Cvetic also has to contend with beautiful Eve Merrick a party member and teacher at his son's school who finds the fact that Cvetic is a double agent . When Eve learns the ugly truth about the party's real motives the reds decide she must be liquidated and Cvetic must aid her without endangering himself . The film should have plenty of suspense and double crossing but there is very little in this film but today's standards very cheesy propaganda and little action or thrills . Lovejoy is very good in the main role but even he and the rest of the cast seem listless . Few surprises here and how did this film receive a Oscar nod for best documentary ? Rating

But is London as safe as Holmes thinks ? Dr. Tobel has engineered a revolutionary new bomb sight that will change aerial bombardment forever he has agreed to give it to the British government but those Nazi's want it just as badly Holmes arch enemy Professor Moriarty Atwill plans on stealing the secret of the bomb sight selling it to the Nazi's . Add the bumbling Inspector Lestrade Hoey of Scotland Yard Dr. Tobel's love interest Charlotte Eberli Verne assassins mysterious scientists a puzzling coded message Holmes has his work cut out to keep Dr. Tobel alive so he can deliver his bomb sight . Directed by Roy William Neill Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon was the fourth in a series of fourteen Holmes films made between to feature Rathbone Bruce as Holmes Watson . The script by Edward Lowe Jr. Scott Darling Edmund Hartmann is based on the short Dancing Men by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is n't the tradition Holmes murder mystery as it's more of a wartime adventure story . To neglect what Holmes is all about the solving of complex crimes mysteries is a big mistake as far as I'm concerned the involvement of the Nazi's the war as a backdrop to the story feels out of place awkward just did n't sit too well with me . The dialogue is n't great Professor Moriarty feels almost like an afterthought as if they could n't come up with a villain for it as a whole it's far less engaging than other's in the series . However at least it's short . Director Neill does his usual efficient job but you have to cut it a little slack bear in mind that it was made over years ago . It has no real style or imagination lacks both atmosphere intrigue as well . Technically the film is OK if unspectacular the black and white cinematography is fine although understand that a computer colourised version is also available . The acting is alright Bruce Hoey do their usual comic relief turns Rathbone's hairstyle in this looks ridiculous I'm glad he changed it for later instalments . Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon was a disappointment when compared to some of the other excellent entries in the series there is very little by which can recommend it everything that made the other's so good seems to be missing here . Leave this one till last watch some of the better ones first for die hard fans only .

In addition contains a considerable number of historical errors . Some examples Nero is a child and Agrippina calls him Nero Nero'' At that time is name was Claudius . He was named Nero after his adoption . Nero did not meet Acte when he was young as in the movie but after his marriage with Octavia and his nomination to Emperor . When becoming Emperor his sons where not adults Britannicus is one month old and Octavia one year old . And many many more . If you are fond of ancient roman history you can find yourselves other examples . Imperium'' series will continue with four more movies Titus'' Marcus Aurelius'' and'' Fall of the Roman Empire'' Finally !
3164_2.txt,0, This film looks great and that's about where my praise ends . Love Is a Many Splendored Thing'' came out in the very schizophrenic year of when candy nonsense like this co with trail artistic fair like Kiss Me Deadly . As a trend toward smaller socially conscious films like On the Waterfront'' and Marty'' established itself in the mid other directors felt the need to stick with the unchallenging pandering melodrama that classifies so many other films from that decade and Love'' is one of the latter . This is the kind of movie where the Technicolor is used to its garish utmost and the lighting is invariably high even scenes taking place in a dark room or at night are brighter than the average sunny day . never want to hear the theme song again as it's played frequently enough over the course of the film to last anyone a lifetime and certainly do n't want to hear it sung by the shrill ear choir that belts it out over the end titles . Jennifer Jones and William Holden are passable but really anybody could have played these parts . Jones role is horribly written character is incredibly inconsistent and it seems as if whenever her character is required to make a decision about something the screenwriters flipped a coin to decide what that decision would be . People will undoubtedly tell me I'm taking this film too seriously that I'm unromantic etc . But loved All That Heaven Allows released the same year and just as cornball in its own way except that Douglas Sirk is able to turn melodrama into an art form whereas Henry King of Love'' is not . I'm usually able to enjoy bad melodrama but in this case was just bored . Grade
2737_1.txt,0, This movie is a great movie ONLY if you need something to sit and laugh at the stupidity of it . As a geologist this movie gets most of the important facts wrong and uses actors that are too young to even be considered in the top of their fields . It is interesting how it shows spurting lava in massive caverns below the Earth's surface . It also is funny how seismically active areas are shown to have massive destruction from a magnitude earthquake . They seem to forget the building standards in these areas would be higher needing a bigger quake to do this much damage . Also it is funny how much they make the coast line of Washington State and also Oregon to look as though they are nice beaches of Southern California . The Jelly donut analogy is very entertaining even if the way it is used is wrong . The director does a good job of adding more comic relief with the supossed'' PhD's .
5751_3.txt,0, At the beginning of we're introduced to three pairs of seemingly unrelated characters . To make matters even more confusing we're informed titles on the screen that the action is taking place in three separate time lines the years and It takes a great deal of time but eventually we come to see how the three pairs are related Mark Austin a young man in his gay and HIV Positive is estranged from his conservative parents Elizabeth and Rev . Robert Austin . Mark is now a drifter and arrives in Kure Beach North Carolina a seaside town where he meets George played by Michael Kelly a gay motel owner and they eventually become involved with each other . Meanwhile Mark's birth mother Grace by Bonnie Hunt has come to the point in her life where she has decided to find the son she gave up for adoption when she was Similarly Mark's adoptive mother also has decided to track her estranged son as she misses him the misgivings of her homophobic minister husband we're told is based on a true story and that perhaps is its Achilles Heel . Director Tim Kirkman tries too hard to create scenes fraught with dramatic tension where there is very little to be found . Take Mark and George both sensitive souls who have little to disagree about . There's some slight tension when Grace faces off against an Adoption Agency Director who is forbidden by law to give her any information about her lost son as well as a slight conflict with her mother who denies that she disapproved of her when she became pregnant as a teenager . No sparks fly either between Elizabeth and Robert since the good Reverend has adamantly insisted from the beginning that he has no intention of reconciling with his son . is similar to Mountain in that the gay couple are the good guys and the straight males example the Kure Beach cop and the Reverend are the baddies . The biggest letdown of the movie is that there is no interaction hence no dramatic conflict between Mark and either one of his Mark is already dead before either the birth or adoptive mother has a chance to reconcile with him . Kirkman's theme is both a plea for tolerance and an exhortation for family members to express their heartfelt feelings before it's too late ! Kirkman's sentiments are for the most part well but they do not make for good drama . Loggerheads moves along at a snail's pace without providing any new revelations suspense regarding such topics as AIDS Adoption and Homophobia . Ultimately fails due to a lack of originality .

They do n't know what to say and they do n't know how to say it which is why they embark on the potentially humiliating enterprise of pre speed dating . Unfortunately they all come across as cardboard characters rather than real people . The story follows a conventional three structure getting to know the sizable cast in their sorry single lives the actual dating circuit and a final stretch of romantic fallout showcasing some of the new couples follies . Because it's all so predictable I'd say that as a narrative Shoppen'' is a failure . As a comedy most of the time it's too goofy to be really funny . Thumbs up to Kathrin von Steinburg . She stands out from the soap opera crowd as the aloof independently wealthy Miriam . Great makeup on her too Wei Heavy eye shadow meets skin lip gloss creating a brooding and bohemian yet girlish effect . Thumbs up also to Stefan Zinner as the Bavarian love machine and Tanja Schleiff as the hot nutritionist . They bypass the communication challenge by way of the timeless body language of copulation .

1699_4.txt,0, If you are a Catalan nationalist anarcho with unnuanced reverence for the mythologies of the Spanish republic this movie may be for you . Two brothers real ones of them being Marc Recha himself re a fictional version of a real journey they had made through the spectacular Catalan countryside and history is evoked of bullet walls artillery booms on the soundtrack but not shown . There is very little dialog and most of it is incidental the story is told in a third voice the voice being that of an actress impersonating the real sister of the real brothers . The images have little to do with what story line there is which is n't much . Many are stunning brooding pans across stark semi mountains and rivers Terrence Malick or Gus Van Sant there's not a little of both Gerry'' and Last Days'' here interspersed with some stunning still images and motionless frames . These are best enjoyed within the film's superb natural sound environment and without the ultimately tedious narration or even the occasional background music quite good some rather odd but all gratuitous The best of what this movie has to say is said in these sequences with their occasional comment inclusion of power stations and dams . The relationship between the brothers is left sketchy and generic a major character is a man catfish never shown . The more the Catalano anarcho commitments of the director are suggested the more the film's richer unspoken message is subverted and the more irritatingly narcissistic the experience becomes . Though the director said at the NYFF screening that the film was conceived from the beginning with its third narrative I'd like to see a version of it without the narrative or the music and with only the natural soundtrack and minimalist dialog the result might be more moving and would in any case not be that much less baffling . Meantime this is most likely the only film you will see this year in which a guy strides into the frame with a cloth object bathing suit he had been wearing ? dangling from his penis . This is one of the few moments in the whole movie in which your interest is pricked by something that's actually happening on screen is that ? why's it hanging there ? but as usual no answers are provided . Very Warholian very sixties and a not a little tiresome .

9821_3.txt,0, The Book gets out of stars . PROBABLY CONTAINS SPOILERS OF BOTH THE BOOK AND THE MOVIE ! If you've never read Geoffrey Household's Rogue Male the source material for Man Hunt you'll likely enjoy Fritz Lang's treatment of the story . On the other hand if you're in my camp and have practically memorized the book the movie will be a crashing disappointment . I'll assume you've already read a synopsis of the story and proceed to my complaints . Household's little novel is one of the all great suspense classics taut and spare with only a bare handful of characters to propel the action . Fritz Lang and his screen writer Dudley Nichols feel the need to throw in the protagonist's brother and a sympathetic floozy the latter of which reduces the depth of the story by injecting an extrinsic motivation into the screenplay where the novel needed none . In fact the true climax of the book was not the nameless narrator's escape from his underground lair but rather his self of his true motive for going on his hunt in the first place . And that's another thing if David Fincher and Quentin Tarantino can get us all the way through Fight Club and Kill Bill without revealing the names of their respective protagonists why ca n't Lang ? Thorndyke ? What hat did they pull that out of ? Which brings me to my bitterest complaint Household's hunter is so quintessentially British would bleed a Union Jack if you cut him . But Walter Pigeon who plays him is Canadian ! He can barely sustain the accent which is only slightly deeper and more convincing that Kevin Costner's in Robin Hood . He looked about right in the role and was a fine actor for the as Rogue Male's reluctant hero ? Let's look to the Sceptered Isle itself for a more convincing version . Remake soon with subtlety and with please ! I'll direct it for free

11571_4.txt,0, years before there was another which represented a key date in the history of Chile South America and the whole world . This was the date in when a bloody coup in Chile deposed Salvador Allende the first Marxist president elected democratically anywhere in the world and put an end to the Chilean experiment of a democratic transition from capitalism to socialism . Allende committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palace . Unfortunately this film is too biased and too nostalgic towards the time of Allende's rule to be an objective rendition of the man and of his place in history . The times were troubled and Allende was a disputed figure in the history of his country and of the whole world . True he was democratically elected but his policies plunged Chile into economic crisis . He was deposed by a coup and a right dictatorship followed with repression and flagrant human rights abuses but he was also an ally of Castro who saw in his policies another way of making revolution . We'll never know if his tentative to build a socialist yet democratic society would have succeeded . The authors of the movie take a completely pro position there is no opinion or point of view trying to explain the other side to answer questions like why did the middle class oppose him or how his democratic views could go together with supporting or being supported by Castro . The tone of the commentaries is nostalgic and apologetic almost propagandistic . People who want to get a better understanding of this episode of the history need to wait for a more balanced and objective film or book in the future .

Instead found my sensibilities somewhat dulled as a succession of bearded Islamic villains replaced each other taunting torturing or killing the wantonly victimized prototypical middle Iranian whose Western cultural sympathies were patent whose exoneration the movie quite blatantly seeks . The deeper understanding the movie does seem to demonstrate is that of the mass market as it serves to nourish prevalent occidental folk a crowd pleaser'' What redeemed the movie from being outright boring was its creative animation genuinely minimalistic imagery which nevertheless always kept the screen rich expressive and unambiguous no small fete for which do give it some stars .

8451_4.txt,0, With the title of the film having the name of the killer fish twice not once you would expect to see them in action attack biting ripping and eating up almost everyone in the cast of characters . Instead you have to wait until the movie is almost over for you to get as much as a glimpse of the Piranahs . Even then all you see is the water bubbling and stirring around as a poor individual disappears under it assuming that he's being eaten whole and alive by the fish . The movie Piranha Piranha'' starts with this scary looking Piranha on the screen as the credits start rolling down but the only time in the movie that you ever get to see the killer fish or fishes you never get to see a Piranha is the movie again . What you do see is a travelogue of Venezuela and it's people and the Venezuelan jungle along the Amazon River basin . Together with a lot of nice and breathtaking photography of the landscape as well as the people and wildlife but that's about all . There is some kind of a story that has to do with this great White Hunter Caribe William Smith which ironically means Piranha in the native language spoken there is this what the title of the film Piranha Piranha'' really meant ? Caribe Caribe'' The person Caribe is played by legendary Hollywood Hell's Angles biker and all around tough guy William Smith . At the beginning of the movie this trio of American tourists Jim Pendrake and his sister Terry Peter Bown Ahna Capri and their American guide Art Green Tom Simcox are on their way into the Venezuelan jungles to go sight with Terry taking photos to send back home . Terry is terrified of guns as we learn that as a young girl saw her father get his head blown off by a gun . Even when Art saves her life using one when see's attack by a six foot long diamondback rattlesnake Terry almost belts him for having a gun which he promised her he would n't take along with him on the trip . At a jungle rest stop or bar the three run into Caribe who we first saw catching monkey's in the jungle at the start of the movie . Caribe makes himself more then welcomed by the three with his knowledge of the jungle and his half philosophy about life and death as well as his ability to get them where their going to the local diamond mines deep in the Amazon basin . Even though a bit strange at first the guy is so in to himself that he does n't seem to notice that there are any people around him Caribe turns out to be a swell and likable guy engaging in a long and friendly motorcycle race through the swamps and jungle with Art . Caribe even shows Terry who at one time in the movie almost knocked his teeth out the fine points of hunting and shooting wild game that he believes do n't really die but become a part of him after he kills them ! bit crazy but you have to admit this guy's got imagination . It's much later in the movie that for some strange reason maybe it was the cheap booze that he was drinking Caribe suddenly goes insane and become homicidal attacking and raping Terry and then murdering her enraged brother and feeding him to the deadly Piranha's . Trying to escape from the rampaging lunatic and then being forced to have to fight it out with him Art gets beaten up so savagely by the dirty Caribe that he's almost left unconscious . Just when Caribe's about to finally kill Art he's shot to death by Terry who after experiencing what this insane nut is all about finally decided that guns are indeed very necessary and should be used to kill on very rare but life occasions . Worth watching if worth watching at all only for the scenery and nothing else . It's just a shame that the movie has to advertise as a killer fish or Piranha horror movie when if it was honest about itself it could have been a more or less average jungle adventure flick with Smith he does have the build for it playing Tarzan of the Venezuelan not African Jungle

The camera hardly moves . Shearer is her usual charming self and Rathbone does well in a romantic leading role . They are all very careful to speak clearly and slowly into the microphone source which does mitigate against a naturally flowing dramatic scene but the play is a sturdy and fun warhorse so one can enjoy oneself if one's expectations are not too high .

1445_4.txt,0, first rented this movie on the infamous day of September Since then I've seen it a number of times . My only complaint is that it's too short . Strangeland'' would've be a complete piece of horror art at two hours . As it stands the running time is only an hour and a half . Ex Sister member Dee Snider wrote produced and stars in this shockfest set in a small Colorado town . He plays Carleton Hendricks a crazed sadist who has psychotic ideologies on human evolution and a love for near experiences . Hendricks is no pushover he's a pumped up six modern primitive'' Someone who has tattooed and pierced their body to the very extreme . When he makes his first full appearance in the film it is a truly terrifying sight . Hendricks main hobby in life is to share his spiritual awakenings'' with his kidnapped victims . He visits Internet chatrooms under the name Capt . Howdy'' and then invites people over to his house . They believe they're going to a party . Instead they find themselves in a house of pain and suffering . Hendricks sows their eyes and mouths shut and tortures them by sticking blades and hooks in numerous parts of their body . If it sounds sick it's because it is . One of Hendrick's victims is Genevieve the teenaged daughter of detective Michael Gage . Gage not only manages to save her but arrests Hendricks as well . Four years later Hendricks is released from a mental institution completely rehabilitated to the disapproval of the community . group of rednecks led by Freddy Krueger himself actor Robert Englund decide to kill him . They fail and Hendricks reverts back to his old self . The rest of the film I'll leave to you only to say the conclusion is satisfying and will leave you in shivers . With the exception of Snider the acting is n't too good but it's serviceable . The direction is okay too . There are some humorous parts in Strangeland'' and they are very funny . also loved the soundtrack it's awesome and worth buying if you love rock . Overall this is a movie worth watching . If you love low horror films with a sense of humor check it out . You'll probably like it .

The only reason for seeing Chronicles is to hear the performances . love Bach's music and even found it hard to sit through this misery of a film . The great Gustav Leonhardt plays two senses of the word Bach . We do n't get much of a sense of him as an actor since he's given so little to do dramatically . Mostly he gets to walk purposefully or angrily out of various rooms . Bach's life of course was not an Errol Flynn movie . It was indeed fairly drab and more than a little hard . This probably means that the life is n't a terrific candidate for a film . The music of course is another story . recommend The Stations of Bach . Far more information for one thing and some insight into the music which is after all why Bach interests us in the first place .

2696_4.txt,0, This is one of those wonderful martial movies that begin with two posses of tough gang members facing off in a park and when the deal goes wrong and the battle starts it turns out they all know karate and kung fu ! The ever Cynthia Rothrock plays usual a cynical deadpan good cop this time in Los Angeles . She and her police partners are trying to break up a counterfeiting ring and when that plot line is exhausted the story just switches over to something else and Cynthia becomes the personal bodyguard of a wealthy great tycoon . Within the film's obviously rock budget there's some helicopter action some speedboat action some car chases a brawl where Cynthia beats up everyone in a country bar some swimming scenes with bimbos in thong bikinis and a surprisingly good horseback chase . About a dozen and a half cops get gunned down . lot of plot twists happen that just do n't make any sense do n't worry about them . counterfeiting currency is a federal crime so where the hell is the FBI ? guess they were too busy . The fight choreography was done by Cynthia Rothrock's frequent co Richard Taylor whose classy and witty presence in front of the camera would frankly have made this a better movie . He also tended to make Cynthia a better actress when they appeared together and frankly she could use it she seems tired and bored and does her best acting in GUARDIAN ANGEL when she is playing opposite a pet dog to whom she delivers bitter drunken monologues . The dog almost out her ! She also wears some of the most god clothing any leading lady has ever worn in any movie loose baggy jeans with pale acid areas over each buttock were the most shocking . The other actors are all over the map . You can picture many of the minor characters being cast this way Hey me and some other guys know are going to be in a movie . You wan na be in it too ? No dude I'm serious ! Then there are the slumming professionals the most fun is Lydie Denier the stunning French model and veteran of Red Shoe Diaries Baywatch Melrose Place and of playing many many other variations on the sexy French bombshell here she plays a psychopathic killer as if she were in BAISEZ or an Alias'' episode and not some direct trash like this . There's also the tall dark and handsome Daniel McVicar now a regular on The Bold and the Beautiful John O'Leary who has played a dignified old man in dozens of movies and sitcom episodes and does it again here and Aharon Ipale the veteran Arab character actor perhaps best known as Pharaoh Seti'' from THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS . For these professionals GUARDIAN ANGEL must be the most laughable entry on their resumes . gave this movie a better rating than it probably deserves because my daughters who are enthusiastic martial students both like to see a woman kicking ass and having the big action scenes for a change . They're still a bit too young to care what a low picture this really was and just enjoyed cheering Cynthia on as she did her swivel high stick thing . If you like this kind of flick you could probably enjoy it on that level .
2918_1.txt,0, If one were to return to the dawn of the talking picture one would prophesy a bright future for Harold Lloyd . Unlike his competitors he was comedic actor trained on the legitimate stage not a performed raised in the purgatory of the music hall or vaudeville circuit . He had a good voice which matched his image . Moreover from on his silent'' films had incorporated sequences based on sound gags lost on the audience the bell sequence at the Fall Frolic from THE FRESHMAN and the monkey sequence in THE KID BROTHER Yet Lloyd's sound features consistently failed at the box office once the novelty of WELCOME DANGER had ebbed . Lloyd blamed his fall on many external sources but never realized that the Glass character's enemy was not sound but the Great Depression . Pre audiences giddy with optimism may have rooted for this ambitious go in whom they saw their surrogate Depression audiences despised him as the person likely to foreclose on their mortgage and throw them in the gutter . Compounding this problem of character choice is Lloyd's perception as an insincere glad hander . Sincerity of course is a subjective appraisal but it is undeniable that Lloyd despite his own tragic upbringing could never play a convincing down Perhaps this is because he feared returning to that state permanently . THE CAT'S fails for these reasons but it alone suffers from the revelation of Lloyd's pro agenda . Many film scholars believe that Lloyd was prompted to make this film because he saw the presidency of FDR as a dictatorship bent on soaking the rich and soft on crime . We should remember that he was not alone in this feeling . DeMille had directed THIS DAY AND AGE a pro state drama the previous year . We should also remember that America was founded by hotheaded tax protesters and continues to be motivated by those who want something without paying for it . TCP suffered because it treated fascism lightly in a comedy'' and because its release was particularly ill given the events in Germany in that year . The Production Code of would ultimately curtail the glorification of vigilante justice and reaffirm the rule of constitutional law cumbersome as it might be . The ideal of the benevolent despot the good all leader who brings about a utopia once freed of the checks and balances on this omnipotence dates to classical antiquity . For this reason totalitarian regimes fear laughter even though it acts as a safety valve . Ironically the mere existence of TCP a film which demonizes the democratic experience of the country of its origin shows that FDR's America was secure enough to accept criticism . One sees no parallel criticism in Hitler's Germany Stalin's USSR or Mussolini's Italy . But can one laugh at the gallows humor of pending fascism ? Lloyd's unnuanced film is skewed to the right and might have been written by Dr Goebbels himself if he'd had a sense of humor of course . It posits an alternative history in which a chosen one restores order and lost honor BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY and does so with good nature and fun . Impending fascism approached by the left is of course Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR . This latter film has the benefit of being set in another country and based on a thinly veiled actual persona and events . THE GREAT DICTATOR produces few laughs today because it under the extent of human evil but it succeeds despite its artless and inappropriate speechifying because it has the distinct advantage of being vindicated by history . Lloyd however should be credited for two things first he neither made any further pro films nor produced any subsequently hypocritically pro films during the War second he never sold TCP to television . The post world had seen the face of fascism and it was n't amusing .

3358_4.txt,0, Below average blaxpoitation action melodrama in which the lovely Ms. Grier plays a private eye who comes to the aid of her father Challenger and his partner Stoker of the original Assault on Precinct whose loan business is being threatened . I'll be frank agree with the few other user comments for this movie . Sheba Baby'' has a less than satisfying script direction that is n't particularly distinguished action scenes that are moderately entertaining at best and one of Ms. Grier's more nondescript supporting casts there's an important supporting role for D'Urville Martin also a familiar name in blaxpoitation get the feeling that this routine movie may have been put together quickly merely to cash in on her then enormous popularity . It sure was cool seeing Stoker again although Ms. Grier does n't have as good a role or dialog as she has had in other films although she is doing what she does best and that's playing a sassy sexy sister on a mission of vengeance . Non soul funk soundtrack is enjoyable at the very least . Mostly recommended to those who wish to see everything in the Pam Grier film repertoire .

Other wise it's a really droll boring film !

9573_4.txt,0, As write this in November I've become aware that the great British boom of cinema has come to an end and while people will claim much of this is down to the British government not giving film makers tax breaks think the cause is much simpler lack of diversity on the part of producers over the last few years Let's have a look at what the Brits were producing Funky gangster thrillers LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRALES was a truly great and thoroughly entertaining film and people went out of their way to ape Guy Ritchie's style with usually disappointing results Romantic comedies Yeah okay do realise FOUR WEDDINGS NOTTING HILL etc were produced by American studios but they're still vaguely British films Unfortunately because they're guaranteed to make a profit for the studios they have to follow a winning formula which usually involved Hugh Grant playing Hugh Grant for the umpteenth time Black Comedies Can anyone explain what a black comedy actually is In the British context it's usually a rambling film with often contemporary political statements made and which often resembles Mike Leigh's NAKED Jasmin Disdar's BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE is a good example of the third type of British movie Filmed in but set in it opens with two men having a fight on a bus and it's later revealed that one's a Serb and one's a Croat so we get a bite sized rundown of what was happening in the Balkans at that time though what's the odds of two former enemies in the Balkans bumping into each other on a London bus This sums up one of the major flaws of the movie Irony takes precedence over likely situations you can appreciate the final irony of the subplots but is the outcome likely Perhaps the greatest irony is the title of the film It's called BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE but certainly this audience member found them clich stereotypical people that could n't believe in as three dimensional characters
6851_1.txt,0, Voor een verloren soldaat for a lost soldier is a sad example of how not to translate to film a touching complex psychological study of that most magical time in a man's life when he is still a child but starting to become a man . The novel records the real life experiences of Rudy van Dantzig as told thru the boy Jeroen during the waning days of WWII at age as he deals with his incipient sexuality and his deep fears of abandonment as he has been sent to the province of Friesland north of Holland by his parents because of the lack of food in Amsterdam and has not heard from them in many months as the postal service has broken down . The arrival of the liberating soldiers in the film is presented in a painfully corny way with the soldiers providing entertainment vaudeville style . Then one soldier Walt romances Jeroen and the pair is presented as two frolicking males . consummate their love in a sexual experience . This taken in stride by the yo Jeroen . The reality was somewhat different Jeroen describes his encounters with Walt in all in detail but in oblique language . But there is no misunderstanding their nature . Walt is aroused to an intense passion by Jeroen during which he handles him roughly so that in their final meeting Jeroen is bruised and suffering a painful wound on the shoulder where Walt has bitten him . During this encounter Walt rapes Jeroen twice . Jeroen could have easily avoided Walt after their encounter when Walt first assaults him as Walt is clearly anxious to keep his abuse of the boy from the other soldiers . Why Jeroen keeps seeking Walt out is a mystery of the human heart and not explainable by me anyway . What the film leaves out is the aftermath the nightmares the dejection the frantic search throughout Amsterdam on the chance of finding Walt for Jeroen loved Walt and nothing could shake that .
3568_4.txt,0, For me this movie is essentially like a feature length pilot episode for a TV series . It reminds me particularly of the British remake of the TV series Wallander starring Kenneth Brannagh . People interviewed by the police are hardy and often as bitter as the weather the lead investigator has huge family problems investigations invariably lead to cruelties of the distant past and the plotting is labyrinthine with strange occurrences and subplots making sense only at the end . Both have excellent cinematography . The plotting of Jar City is extraordinarily reminiscent of a standard UK or US crime series . Effectively you could take the plots of any of the episodes of Touch of Frost and transplant them on top of the bleak locale in this movie and have an effective sequel . Really the script could n't be more obviously from the cookie cutter . You get even the most familiar of motifs such as the police going to the local prison to interview a manipulative and dangerous psychopath who inevitably explodes at the end of the interview . I'm absolutely convinced that this is scones and jam for many folk but feel it needs pointing out to people like myself who do not go to the cinema to watch television . What felt a keen lack of was message . The movie takes as its theme the genetic studies in Iceland . Icelanders in genetic terms have remained largely isolated from the outside world presenting a great opportunity for scientists to study their genetics . Lots of information concerning the heredity of the population has been kept and many genetic diseases unique to Iceland can be traced effectively in a population that has refrained from interbreeding and is remarkably genetically homogeneous like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle of the London underground map instead of a jigsaw puzzle of a field of daisies company called deCODE genetics attempted to set up a database carrying all the genetic and hereditary information for the entire population of Iceland . Due to privacy concerns this project was terminated and at the end of last year deCODE genetics went bankrupt in Iceland . The episode is a rich topic for debate . But in this movie genetics and medical science are not there for education's sake they're there for weird atmosphere . It's a grisly movie if you are interested in that and there's often a morbid focus on food to accompany events like a coroner who eats lunch in between incisions . The most queasy for me was when the lead inspector devours a sheep's head . Unfortunately for me this occasionally became farcical . The movie attempts the rather delicate task of mixing the grisly with the sentimental and ended up providing unintentional humour towards the end . This is the equivalent in cinematic terms of attempting to prepare fugu if you're not well deft of hand and sharp of eye you poison the client . This rather novice director should have lowered the tariff on his performance . walked out of this movie feeling rather bad about myself and about life in general .

They proceed to give their daughter her present which is from both of them and it stuck me funny the expressions on the two parents faces as they gave their child this gift it was almost like hope she likes it There is a killing in the film and Catherine Mary Stewart Kerbridge gets involved with the case because of family ties . Julia is working hard to become a doctor and this particular murder disrupts her entire life . Rob Lowe Finney From The Top'' is a next door neighbor in the same apartment dwelling as Julia and he eventually goes to bed with her and tries to help her in other ways . This is not a bad film but it is certainly nothing to go crazy about unless you like a film location in Canada and a good looking Catherine Mary Stewart a native from Canada .

In the film Jesse the main character forms an unusual friendship with a girl named Leslie . Due to a very simple but careless mistake one of the pair dies . At the time found the story very powerful because the fatal mistake is exactly the type of mistake a kid would make and so any kid watching the film will find it very easy to identify with and feel the emotional weight of the tragedy that ensues . Last year finally tracked down a VHS copy of the show . probably should have stuck with my memories . Watching the show as an adult was absolutely shocked by what a horribly made film this was . My girlfriend had a similar memory of the movie as well and she too was pretty sad about how bad the movie was compared to her memories . Many adults probably have a good memory of watching this movie when they were kids . strongly advise that these people leave their memories intact and avoid seeing this film as an adult .
6809_4.txt,0, Dustin Hoffman's debut feature is n't as bad as it's reputed to be a Spanish co filmed in Italy with the director using the pseudonym Dan Ash'' the film is uneven but generally diverting and deals with a plethora of shady characters in search of a hidden by gangster Cesar Romero despite being third after Elsa Martinelli and Hoffman himself expires before the credit sequence has even rolled ! Hoffman's performance obviously is nowhere near as nuanced as in later films but manages to dodge embarrassment by playing what basically amounts to an amiable klutz an accident American treasury agent of Sicilian descent Puzzu which nobody seems to be able to get right ! sent out by his firm to retrieve the money and told to remain inconspicuous'' but instead is forever getting into trouble though he ultimately proves surprisingly resourceful by finding the loot foiling the crooks and winning the girl as Romero's daughter who's somewhat wasted here Still the film's best moments are provided by suave gangster Riccardo Garrone apart from his would hard persona and the hilarious use of dialect he's flanked by a trio of nitwits who more often than not prove a hindrance in the fulfillment of his various schemes ! Also in view of the story being set in Rome it's odd that the police officer investigating the case is a Spaniard an exigency of the co deal Along the years I've missed out on Hoffman's other Italian comedy ALFREDO ALFREDO a number of times guess mainly because Leonard Maltin only rates it in his Movies Video Guide'' then MADIGAN'S MILLION gets a BOMB ! with Pietro Germi directing and co the luscious Stefania Sandrelli the credentials of that film are certainly more respectable and really hope it turns up again on Italian TV soon .
2258_1.txt,0, Summary Not worth the film As an avid Gone With the Wind fan was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters . Luckily the film on its own was a wonderful piece . When the book Scarlett came out read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together . While the book lacks any true quality it remains a good story and as long as was able to separate it from the original was and still is enjoyable . However consider the six hours spent watching the Scarlett'' miniseries to be some of the worst hours of my life . Discrediting any of the original character traits so well in Margaret Mitchell's book this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape mistrust murder and misformed relationships that even the book Scarlett stayed away from . The casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well in both the original novel and film and even carried through in the second book and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character . In the novel Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her estranged husband Rhett Butler to Charleston under the guise of visiting extended family . After coming to an arrangement'' with Rhett she agrees to leave and proceeds to reconnect with her O'Hara relatives in Savannah . Eventually she accompanies her cousin Colum a passionate leader of the Fenian Brotherhood to Ireland to further explore her family's roots that go deep and is eventually named The O'Hara the head of the family . While her duties as The O'Hara keep her engaged in her town of Ballyhara Scarlett ventures out into the world of the English landowners and instantly becomes a sought guest at many of their parties . She having been scorned by Rhett time and time again eventually agrees to marry Luke the earl of Fenton until Rhett comes along in a clich night type of a rescue . The Scarlett'' miniseries fails even to do this justice . Raped by her fianc and scorned by her family the series shows Scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed . heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision .
6936_3.txt,0, Eugene O'Neill and a half hour play brought to the screen in less than two hours . The play's combination of symbolic dialogue and gothic melodrama has n't aged very well and the cast has some difficulty with it especially Norma Shearer's Nina and Ralph Morgan's Marsden . Clark Gable as Ned Darrell comes off better but mostly because his is a gruff character not given to the philosophical musings of the others which better fits Gable's range . Once the plot settles down to the love quadrangle and the audience adjusts to the voiceover asides the film does become more enjoyable . The technique used here for the asides is another problem . On stage the action froze while the actors spoke their thoughts to the audience . Here they're done as voiceovers . You'd think that would work better but since the action no longer freezes the actors are forced to pause speaking and grimace at the camera to match the emotions in their thoughts . Plus it's difficult for any movie buff to watch this film and not think of Groucho Marx's hilarious parody version in Animal Crackers . Added to these drawbacks are some cuts made for censorship reasons promiscuity is soft and there is no mention of her getting the abortion that is more central in the play and a wretched score that sounds like background music to a turn weepie . O'Neill called this film dreadful hash of attempted condensation and idiotic censorship and although Strange Interlude'' is nowhere near as great as his later The Iceman Cometh'' and Long Day's Journey Into Night it certainly deserved better than this .
7077_4.txt,0, STAR RATING Unmissable Very Good Okay You Could Go Out For Meal Instead Avoid At All Costs The tale of the titular Adam Halloran and Paul Murphy two heroin addicts in the slums of Dublin and their daily amblings about in their meaningless lives searching for the next fix that will make their day . Along the way they try and reconcile with close family and friends who they've managed to let down and destroy over the years . know a lot of Irish people like to drink but it seems some of them have problems with heroin too by the looks of this movie . know there is a bit of a drug problem over there like there is in many parts of the world so another humorous take on the subject matter is not an entirely unexpected thing . do n't recall the last Irish movie saw film is shot in a style that makes it stand out from any film I've seen lately ! And judging from that obviously I'm not as enlightened on their humour as could be . The film is rather funny in certain parts but it's obviously another comedy that is n't afraid to raise near laughs . The scene in which the mentally disabled boy is robbed down the back of an alley is certainly true of what a pair of junkies might do to feed their habit but is nonetheless utterly despicable and I'm not sure if it was meant as dark humour in any way but it certainly did n't put a smile on my face ! It's also in stark contrast to their previous actions where they're seen showing their soft side rocking a baby to In light of this some may find the ending sad others may see it as just desserts . Overall just failed to see the point to the film . did n't see any motivation in the it was telling . It just seems to amble along without really involving the audience in any way . Unlike Trainspotting dealt with similar themes ! it's an unsuccessful effort for the most part that had me on the verge of nodding off despite it's very short minute running time . Really no more enjoyable than following two real life junkies around for a day .

It's a movie about the serial killer Richard Speck who killed several nurses in Chicago in the sixties . Watching the movie one gets the feeling that it follows the crimes to the letter . Unfortunately that does n't make for a good movie . Another problem had was the near music letting us know that this was a SCARY MOVIE and some god narration letting us know what's motivating Speck . The acting was average for this type of film to give credit where credit is due the movie is very beautifully photographed for my taste . Your mileage may vary . Over all if you're interested in the subject matter it may be worth your time .

It's not about the daily musings of an eccentric family'' nor about the other boring stuff you see everywhere in sitcoms . The show is about this small white trash thief who scratches off a lottery card and scores big time . Right at that moment took it away from him . Overtime he learns that that unusual incident was probably because of all the bad things he's been doing so he sets off on a mission to right every wrong he ever did and he's got all his deeds on a paper . This is a brilliant premise for a sitcom . Thankfully it landed in the right hands . The execution of the show produces extremely satisfactory results you get an innovative comedy that is genuinely funny and really touching at many times . You ca n't help but fall in love with Earl's sincerity and steadfastness Randy's simple mind good heart and observations on life Joy's wild flamboyant personality and Darnell's mellow chillin demeanor that really endears him to you very easily . When you combine the show's innovation with its genuine humor good heart interesting characters and well dialogue you really have a keeper . With shows like this the incomparable The Office'' NBC is obviously on to something . Did they finally free a cubicle or two for quality assurance ? Let's hope so . And let's hope for more quality shows like these will occupy the line shows that'll make both us TV viewers and NBC executives stop crying over the long gone days of NBC's golden days Seinfeld Friends

8879_4.txt,0, Having watched this movie several times have come to the conclusion that Milos Forman made a very daring decision to manufacture a muse for Goya when the artist led what most would consider a tempestuous life while the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era raged across Europe surely one that would have sufficient drama upon which to draw . While do understand that Mr. Forman was relating in the microcosm of the tragedy of Ines life the devastation of the world at that time was left feeling that there was just so much of Goya left out so much of his humanity . The strongest and most eloquent point this film made was that because of man's fallen nature each of us is a potential villain in the stream of life each of us has evil within us that we must fight with the help of God . How eloquent when Goya says he should have helped Ines more how true for all of us ! We must defend and protect the innocent . The superbly ironic scene in which the once imprisoned priest sentenced to die pronounces the death sentence on Lorenzo who condemned him originally is the stuff of genius . was left wanting something more when the credits rolled . Maybe less of the unreal coincidences and more of the inner life of the characters .
5061_4.txt,0, Angel is a change of pace for Besson monochrome mawkish and rather mediocre . It is well photographed on location in Paris although subtitle should note quick dialogue AND good cinematography may make for frustrating viewing . This film is no Wings of Desire'' or Wonderful Life'' Despite its shared themes intervention averts suicide angel relationships ensue Besson does nothing to enlighten or inspire us . Even the well acted teary moments rapidly descend into toe sentimentality . The film's flawed ideology irritates an Angel whose message of love and respect for self is constantly undermined by her own violent and promiscuous behaviour a happy ending'' which negates the hero's supposed journey from helplessness to self and independence . Verdict Quite nice to look at but confused moral and philosophical messages tarnish the film precisely where it should shine .
3222_2.txt,0, great gangster flick with brilliant performances by well actors with great action scenes ? Well not this one . It's rather amazing to see such a wide cast of well actors that have many good movies in their filmographies in such a movie without doubt this may be one of the worst they could possibly appear in . First of all the plot is as you'd expect it from your average gangster biography nothing new nothing fancy in it . The way it is told makes the movie look a LOT longer than it is thought the two hours should be almost over was quite surprised that only minutes had passed The action scenes look a lot like those from TV series the for example . It's just that in the with the those scenes were far more sophisticated than those in El Padrino'' It's especially fun to see the guys point their guns in the air and still hit something to talk about people that take cover behind car doors which later look like they've been shot through The acting fits quite nicely to the action . Either you get the same reaction to everything that happens Lundgren style or it's so overacted that you may think it's a parody unfortunately it's not My advise is to stay away from this movie any other gangster movie is better than this one .
6761_3.txt,0, first saw this movie at a Saturday matinee when was very young . thought it was cool and often thought about it . Well finally resaw it on DVD . It was still very entertaining but in a different way . It has to rank as one of the goofiest campiest sci movies . It seemed filled with stock military footage . The dialogue is stilted and effects are crude . There is one line of dialogue that had me in stitches . The line Jeff Morrow says while on the beach with the babe . Rent it if you need a movie to watch with a bunch of drunken friends . It is a classic .
9159_3.txt,0, honestly thought this movie was going to be cheesy even though I've liked Alvin and the Chipmunks for a LONG TIME ! was was very wrong . IT WAS GREAT ! It has been the best movie have seen since October ! In my opinion it's the movie everyone should see this holiday season ! Enchanted thought anyway . awful The Golden Compass was alright but the ending was pretty crappy to His Dark Materials fans and Am Legend well have n't seen that yet National Treasures but it looks alright . I'm not about to give anything away but this movie is great for anyone especially kids !
624_3.txt,0, ca n't understand why many seem to hate this . This movie ties together many of the overlapping settings of the historical and Biblical epics of the fifties using set pieces props and costumes similar to those seen in other movies . Here however the story attempts to run through all of human history with a frame story about the human race being on trial with a guilty verdict meaning will go off all over the world . The prosecutor is the devil played with fiendish glee by Vincent Price . OK so it's a little hokey calling the defender The Spirit of All Men but think that's one of the things that gives this movie a sense of period charm . The Spririt of Man is incidentally played quite well by Ronald Coleman in his last film . It is also the last movie in which Groucho Harpo and Chico Marx all appear but not together . Groucho plays Peiter Minuet buying Manhattan from the Indians in a scene played purely for campy humor . Chico is n't funny at all as a monk who thinks the world is flat and Harpo we are told is meant to be Isaac Newton discovering gravity . Most of the other performances are well done though . Other hokey things are that the trial is supposedly taking place in outer space which is depicted as a region of clouds and blueness . There is something called The Great Clock of Outer Space which when striking midnight may signal the end of the world . But at its heart the movie addresses the problems of WMDs and the eternal question of whether Man is basically good or basically evil and poses it in what think is an interesting way . Also anyone who likes the look of costume epics of the fifties should like the look of this movie .
8776_4.txt,0, loved this movie when it first came out was just years old then and had forgotten this film existed until one day found a used copy for sale at a gas station . bought it and could n't wait to watch this film that had loved as a kid and then as saw this film again many years later hit me . Why in the world did like this film as a Kid watching it again as an adult realized that this film is terrible . The saddest part about this film is that they had everything in place to make the greatest western ever and they blew it ! the costumes are perfect actors there are music scores the orchestrail score is wonderful and keeps with the classic spirit of the old timey Lone Ranger alive the second score is a series of songs by country music artest like Merle Haggerd and The Statler Brothers and those songs like The Man in the Mask'' are so bad that they are funny . This movies Strongest point is that it had a Briliant Storyline and one of the best Western plots ever and for a while its fun to watch as John Reid is nursed back to health he and his fellow Rangers are ambushed . fun to see him grow into his new life and Identity as the Lone Ranger he concels his identity and goes on a revenge run to get the gang responsible for killing his brother and all his fellow rangers to whom he rode with . But unfortunatly good as the storyline is its all ruined by Merle Haggard Narrating everything as you are watching it happen the love of God why did they do that ? between Merle Haggard's Narration and The Statler Brothers singing corny songs like Ride little cowboy'' being playing in the backgound make this movie impossible to take serious . would Love to see a really good producer take this same script and story and re this film right at the heart of this silly film is a great western . would descibe this film as a beautiful woman dress in the ugliest clothing . give it stars out of your years old and dont know better then you might love it .
9432_4.txt,0, wonderful semi homage to Expressionistic black and white films of folks like FW Murnau Fritz Lang Carl Dreyer Marcel Carn and others . Allen plays a character caught in a Kafkaesque nightmare at first thinking he is part of a vigilante group trying to catch a killer and slowly realizing that he might be a suspect . The writing is a little forced is after all Woody Allen trying to be a coy Kafka but the point is made and no harm done . The cinematography is interesting about shades of gray but make sure you watch in a very dark room with a good screen or details will get swallowed in the fog . This is an amusing little movie with a few laughs that are actually snorts of uh The acting is fine considering the odd vehicle and it's worth watching if you are big Woody Allen fan . Also of interest to those knowledgeable about Expressionistic films . I'd give this a out of
8530_3.txt,0, Special sneak previews are always a good time . No matter what movie it is you are seeing the theatre will always be packed by people who have been awaiting the film like free stuff thought it'd be something to do or just got lost . Either way no matter how good or bad the film the audience alone will make it enjoyable . Now when said movie is a PG pseudo horror film you really delve into horror when the MPAA is on your back censoring everything ? you know there will be chatter laughing and breath holding . With The Messengers the crowd did not disappoint giving numerous outbursts and warnings to the characters on screen . As for the actual movie feel sorry for those involved because it really could have been much better had it been paced right and allowed to stretch its legs beyond the scare aftermath progression these films have . In the end we are shown a boring plodding story with no surprises and few moments of actual suspense . The story is a common one . family moves from the big city to the country after a traumatic event to try and rebuild their relationship with each other . Once settled in the spirits of the house come out to the reformed troublemaker child whose past makes it even easier for the parents to disbelieve everything told to them . Of course the child is not crying wolf and those around only find out when it is too late . will credit the Pang Brothers of the acclaimed The Eye that would like to watch more than before to see what they can do without Hollywood interference reshoots on The Messengers were done by someone else but the brothers retained credit it's a shame what our studio system does to foreigners especially when it was creative independence which made the films that brings them in and not bottomline interference for really having a fitting style and for keeping the tired plot line somewhat fresh . Unfortunately though also must give them credit for the almost unbearable slowness . Similar to why disliked What Lies Beneath could n't stand the drawn out suspense which goes so far as to make it laughable . When our heroine and her brother stand in a hallway with a ghost behind them the scene lasts about eight minutes with just static oddly composed close and depth of field focus changes to end up culminating to absolutely nothing . For being only minutes almost think it would have worked better even shorter . Besides a very effective opening sequence featuring the fantastic Jodelle Ferland playing a boy and a great atmospheric credit sequence the only thing that saves the film from utter garbage is the acting . Except for Penelope Ann Miller who first made me wonder what ever happened to her and then after a few scenes made me understand why never asked that question in the years she was absent and Dustin Milligan completely lacking in credibility the acting is very strong . Dyan McDermott does a nice job as the father trying to keep his family together through all the tough times . He has many little moments of light comedy to counteract his serious dramatic role . William Davis favorite Cancerman is used effectively as an almost foreboding character sadly not utilized more . Our true stars are Kristen Stewart and John Corbett . Stewart plays the emotion very well and shows some promise as an actress with this and Panic Room on her resume . As for Corbett if he did n't pull off his role the entire movie would have unraveled completely . do wish he would be given more work as I've enjoyed him since the under series The Visitor'' still need to check out his first role in Northern Exposure a show have n't yet been able to catch up on . It's a shame he will probably be most recognizable for the overrated My Big Fat Greek Wedding . If anything The Messengers gave me a nice introduction to the Pang Brothers work and reinvigorated my desire to check out their Chinese horror catalog . The mood and performances were there it was just the simple and vacant story that needed way too much padding to make a feature film . If they delved more into other characters rather than just Stewart's it could have been more effective while also having something more to show then ten minute scenes of nothing . If our protagonist is the only one being attacked there is no suspense as to how far the creatures will go to harm her . The moments of danger had no gravity to them and until the ending really just stood in as filler . am excited however for the free comic book given away after the special screening as hopefully the medium will allow for a faster paced story that engrosses before it tries to surprise .
6582_1.txt,0, know most of the other reviews say that this movie was great but have to disagree . Sure it's a good book ! It was actually one of my favorites when was verrry little . But it's just not meant for theaters . Maybe for a little half short but do n't see how they can turn a short kiddie book into a whole feature film . It is a cute movie but would only recommend it for really little kids . Older kids will have no interest it . Adults may have a little more interest if they watch it with their young ones . But anyone ages will have a snore Sorry if you disagree with me but this is my opinion .

This troubled young Elisabeth so much that she never forgot the issue . We must remember she was only She was so embarrassed that she kept a fear for sex all her life .

810_1.txt,0, If could give this movie a negative rating would . The humor is the cruelest have ever seen in a film . Horrible things happen to good people and people who have already suffered horribly through no fault of their own . There are plots neither of which supports half of a film . Where is the depth'' others see in this movie ? That no good deed goes unpunished ? That only the heartless can succeed ? The film does start well and the black and white is very moody and well done . The acting is very good and convincing witch makes the cruel humor even more horrifying . If you think that the Stooges are too nice to each other if watching the beheading of a kidnap victim with a Bowie knife is a real thigh slapper if you thought Schindler's List'' was hilarious then this movie is for you .

Filmed in France The Land That Loves Lewis in and released the following year after a five layoff the boys are in truly terrible shape physically . However they are n't in nearly as bad a shape as the script . This movie is one of the un comedies'' ever filmed . It's painful to see this legendary team the funniest duo in the history of motion pictures the twosome that made The Devil's Brother'' The Music Box Up Your Troubles'' Babes In Toyland'' Bonnie Scotland'' Flying Deuces'' and so many more gut laugh classic comedies in a film such as this . But fighters and ballplayers do it all the time . They stay in the game one season or one fight too many . In this case while is morbidly fascinating to see Laurel Hardy at this late stage in their legendary careers they too stuck around for one too many .

It really speaks to all those mundane choices we all make every day and an Welles Story ca n't quite recall may live to want back . Keep in mind that this is a SHORT short It starts out slowly but just as you begin to think it has become boring it's over . And believe me the line is one you will remember . I'm not sure if the producers are going to make it available for purchase or available on the web but either way you'd be happy you took the time to get hold of a copy of that am sure .

9121_3.txt,0, loved the first American Graffiti'' with all my heart and soul that considered it to be the best movie about rock roll along with being the best teenager flick I've ever seen . The first film spawned the careers of George Lucas who would later do the blockbuster epic Star Wars'' before doing the prequels two decades later while making Richard Dreyfuss a star in Jaws Close Encounters of the Third Kind and other films as well . Somehow without those two the magic died off . More American Graffiti'' shows audiences what happened to the rest of the characters later on in the sixties where Steve Howard and Laurie Williams are protesting against the Vietnam War while their friend Terry The Toad'' Fields Martin Smith is in the war himself and trying to get out . John Milner Le Mat is still the hot drag racer in California where he never quite left home . The rest of the supporting actors in the film from Candy Clark's Debbie Girlfriend to the Pharaoh's gang members along with Harrison Ford and others really do n't do much . The original film showed teenagers cruising the streets without any bloodshed with the early music of rock roll from Buddy Holly The Fleetwoods Chuck Berry Fats Domino Bill Haley and the Comets Buddy Knox and more that brought back the nostalgia bug in classic music . The soundtrack for More American Graffiti'' is a mixture of rock soul country hippie music and whatever fitted the mood during the late of protesting drugs sacrifices and more . After watching More American Graffiti'' it looked like it wanted to show audience members what happened after the title epilogue of the four main characters in the first film the exception of Dreyfuss's character where it was n't necessary . This film was n't necessary either as was glad to see that neither Lucas or Dreyfuss moved on to bigger and better projects .

6193_1.txt,0, let me first just say that in the past have been a huge carlin fan . think george is one of the smartest people and best comedians on the planet . what made george so great in the past was his ability to look at things in his own twisted way and give us his unique perspective on those things . it was n't always meant to be funny but you always respected his opinions because they were presented in such a clever way . but you are all diseased is just a long rant . he does n't give us any unique perspective on anything he just gives us a long list of stuff that he's at . there is no insight no cleverness just an old man complaining for one hour straight about things that we have all complained about . and on top of that it was n't even funny . you are all diseased appeals to dumb people who ca n't handle anything more advanced than something simple and direct . do n't mind anger fueled comedy but george could have done so much better . really hope that george carlin's next show will live up to the quality that george has shown in the past .
1463_4.txt,0, It opens and for half an hour runs like an educational programme on the Old Testament although not without humour . The movie finally begins to grow wings when the biblical cant gets dropped . In a scene of mixed success Martin Donovan decides to renege on kicking off the Apocalypse and the final quarter of an hour is a sort of humanist all the fuss about ? play gilded with optimistic conjecture against a miserably ironic long shot of the WTC twin towers . Apart from Donovan's authority the acting is split . There's the thespian melodrama of the rest of the cast this though formally contrived for biblical presentation is appropriate for the modern paranoid comedy that Hartley's aiming at . But was also pleasantly surprised at the contribution of PJ Harvey thus and in danger of existing within the film solely as the pop star entity she is not least in a set piece scene in a record store and a perilously patchy soundtrack to which contributes She remained cool a sort of disingenuous lack of focus in the manner of many pop icons who have taken to film thinking the Jagger of Performance here but nonetheless maintained a convincing integration with both cast and project . Ultimately affirmative but this bittersweet essay is a bit too much like one and relies more on the perseverance than the imagination of its audience .
6706_4.txt,0, CORRIDORS OF BLOOD Aspect ratio Sound format Mono and white London Whilst attempting to formulate an anaesthetic solution a dedicated surgeon Karloff becomes addicted to narcotics and is blackmailed by local bodysnatchers . Riding the coat of a Gothic revival occasioned by the recent success of Hammer's THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN Robert Day's CORRIDORS OF BLOOD is an odd mixture of historical drama and Grand Guignol theatrics . Producer Richard Gordon lured Karloff away from Hollywood where his movie career had become stalled in a rut ISLAND FRANKENSTEIN etc . for a couple of lurid shockers in which good men are thwarted by circumstances beyond their control . In GRIP OF THE STRANGLER he played a novelist who stumbles onto a horrific secret whilst researching a series of murders from recent history while in CORRIDORS OF BLOOD he's a drug surgeon who falls prey to a gang of criminals masterminded by East End pub landlord Francis de Wolff . Less a horror film than a melodrama with ghoulish trimmings the movie hedges its commercial bets by including a number of gory thrills leg sliced open a face destroyed by acid etc . but the narrative is motivated chiefly by Karloff's altruistic pursuit of an anaesthetic formula that will alleviate the terrible suffering of patients during surgery . Produced under the title Doctor from Seven Dials the finished movie went unreleased until due to indifference by distributors MGM by which time co Christopher Lee had earned a prominent screen credit despite playing a small but significant role as Joe a sinister Cockney thug who murders carefully selected patrons of de Wolff's squalid pub and sells the remains to local doctors . Lee filmed this glorified cameo before THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN catapulted him to international stardom which accounts for his limited screen time though his intense performance is one of the film's highlights . Adrienne Corri CIRCUS distinguishes herself as de Wolff's partner in crime and there's a feast of familiar faces in supporting roles including Francis Matthews PRINCE OF DARKNESS Betta St. John CITY OF THE DEAD Finlay Currie and Nigel Green . Superb art direction Anthony Masters and cinematography Faithful

As usual the pure sadistic display can be explained as a clever thought way of sending violence back into the audience's face . Sure Mr Tarantino . Violence is Baaad . Sadism is Baaad . It is well worth wading in it to make that point . How very brilliant . The juvenile part of the audience may well not be clever enough to follow all the smart references to higher levels of consciousness though but I'm confident they'll see the light one day . Thanks for making this little world of ours a little better . You deserve a medal .
6372_1.txt,0, have been collecting Iron Man comics since the early and always enjoyed the character who is far far from the average clean cut hero and his many and varied enemies . There have been no less than three attempts at an animated series for Iron Man and only the original and part of the second have ever done the character justice . So was somewhat hopeful that this newest version would be good . Boy was wrong ! The DVD art is VERY misleading and presents an image that is not the movie . Fist off the good what little there is . The art and animation are well drawn and the writing and dialog are generally good though with notable exceptions . Character voices are very well selected and each character is distinctive and well acted . Now for the bad . Unfortunately the writers opted to totally screw around with both Iron Man's origin and especially the Mandarin's . On top of that they decided to do Iron Man and his opponents all in CGI . Bad CGI . This makes them stand out almost as badly as live actors would in a cartoon . The CG work is often repetitive and glaring shortcuts are taken at times . The CG battles are clumsy as well further enhancing the fact that CG and line animation do not mix well . The movie would certainly have fared better had they opted to actually DRAW all the characters . Another problem is that Iron Man is in his traditional Red and Gold suit for all of ONE battle ! And its not even the big fight at the end . All this drags the movie down and it never picks up . SPOILERS warnings MAY FOLLOW The movie starts off with an interestingly unusual stop motion credit sequence of machinery welding and gears . Then we are introduced to what looks like a Chinese temple in the process of being restored and prominent is a statue of what fans will recognize as the Mandarin . Things go strangely impeding progress in restoring the temple . Overseeing it is James Rhodes Tony Stark's long time friend . Seems they plan to actually raise the temple up from the earth despite opposition by a group who insist that raising the temple will bring about a terrible disaster . Rhodes is captured in a raid . Stark shown in a hot tub with a lovely lady is informed of the problems and sets out to personally oversee the project and rescue his friend while in the background his father deals with Board Executives who are pushing to have Tony removed . Tony arrives only to have his armored escort ambushed and blown to pieces . Tony later awakens mortally wounded in the heart and a prisoner of the rebels . He is saved only by quick action from Rhodes and a scientist . Eventually Stark must build the prototype gray iron armor and makes good an escape but only after some loss of life . While with the rebels he meets a troubled girl named Li Mei and the two fall in love . The Temple is raised and four elemental beings done in CG appear and proceed to start collecting hidden rings of power . Stark and Rhody find trouble back home but manage to confront the elementals without success in really stopping them First using the Aquatic Armor then the more classic Red and Gold Armor and finally everything returns to the temple and Stark is back in the bulky gray armor for a final showdown and a run in with what may be Fin Fang Foom in CG . Here the story takes a major twist as it turns out that the Mandarin needs a host body to manifest . This leads to a somewhat tragic final battle marred by the fact that the Mandarin is little more than a ghost and is n't seen till the last minutes of the movie . ugh . If you are an Iron Man fan then you will likely not enjoy this outing . And even non may well find the movie somewhat lacking or not .
8754_3.txt,0, Hollywood had a long love affair with bogus Arabian Nights tales but few of these products have stood the test of time . The most memorable were the Jon Hall Maria Montez films which have long since become camp . This one is filled with dubbed songs anachronistic slang and slapstick . It's a truly bounteous crop of Mesopotamian corn and pretty near intolerable today . It was nominated for its imaginative special effects which are almost unnoticeable in this day and age consisting mainly of trick photography . The only outstanding positive feature which survives is its beautiful color and clarity . Sad to say of the many films made in this genre few of them come up to Alexander Korda's original Thief of Baghdad'' Almost any other Arabian Nights film is superior to this one though . It's a loser .
7191_3.txt,0, When you read the comment on this film that it's smart and funny political comedy based on true events the only true word here is that it's a comedy . If you're told it's insider movie about Russian politics it's not . There's probably only in the movie from what really happened in Russia during that election In reality of the it was thousand times more interesting to follow the situation and that was a real funky election Well there were PR from the US working in the Yeltsin's staff but their role was just minimal . The whole campaign was totally different from what is shown in the movie it would be much funnier showing all the president's people riding across the country with paper boxes full of cash and the celebrities giving the shows to support Yeltsin all over the place at least that would be true . give it three only because of the respect to Jeff Goldblum Antony LaPagglia and Liev Schreiber . And about the machine guns on the streets of Moscow . was living in the place that had the highest amount of hard crime in Russia in the middle of and never seen a man with the gun on the street .

Also the first movie just confirmed that Naruto is all about great fun great action great story But then came the movie . was very hyped because the first movie turned out great . But it did n't satisfy me one bit . The story was lame action was n't all that great . especially compared to the Anime series . same goes for the quality of animation . found it very poorly . Could the story get any lamer . ANY Where's the kyuubi of Naruto Not once does he turn demon . mean COME ON My advice is . see the series until episode then it's just fillers and then read the Manga because that's still great . Ignore this movie and hope for something better in the future . All and all gave it a just because it's Naruto .
8882_3.txt,0, With a title like that you will be forgiven for thinking this film is about the great painter Goya . Then after half an hour you decide it is more about the Roman Catholic Inquisition . With even more latitude perhaps it is just a snapshot of the period . With lurid characterisation too many axes to grind and a scant regard for fact Milos Forman dishes up a colourful but shambolic rambling mish that fails on all three accounts . Milos Forman lost his Jewish father to Nazi concentration camps is the great director who painted the artist Mozart as a buffoon and got away with it . Won awards for it in fact . His life in Czechoslovakia gave him a taste of diverse repellent regimes especially Communism . He also made the equally over but rather impressive One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest . So at the age of how does he come to offer us this mess ? In Goya's Ghosts Goya is one step removed from buffoon . The main character is Brother Lorenzo passionately acted by Javier Bardem . Natalie Portman is equally vibrant as Goya's model Ines later in the film her own daughter The tenuous connection with Goya is that he happens to paint both of them . Lorenzo tortures then rapes Ines who he suspects of being a Jew . Her father tortures Lorenzo . Napoleon dashes in to liberate Spain Ines gets out of the dungeon the Church has left her in and searches for her child . Goya is still painting but has gone deaf . His main preoccupation seems to be helping Ines . And so on . Historically Goya was also a historian . As Forman had sadly relinquished the idea of a biopic of Goya the painter this one fact could have been used to pull the whole film together a large slice of history as seen by Goya . But the painter is too tangential to receive any weight . Similarly a document of the terrors of the Inquisition should be done compared to other despotic orders throughout time the Holy See has been forgiven with barely a confession . Though one might ask if Forman is competent enough to be trusted with a factual account of anything . thought this could be the heart of a wonderful story he says in the production notes . There were a great many parallels between the Communist society we lived under and the Spanish Inquisition . But the story is too tenuous to hold our attention . Against our expectations and with a background of something major life of a great painter the horrors of the Inquisition and even the French Revolution we are instead asked to feel involved in a concocted kind infatuation of Goya's . The result is that we feel cheated . Background detail is appallingly handled . Goya went deaf in the film starts not years later . Napoleon is as believable as a cut from a cereal packet . We see the Church passing out a death sentence the normal procedure was for the Church to insist that the secular arm did that dirty work Battles look overly and stagey . peppering of gratuitous naked bosoms hardly makes up for it . On the positive side the production values are mostly good . The colours are vivid the pacing excellent least until we give up on finding any worthwhile storyline . Bardem is excellent and Portman is a joy until she goes into overdrive as a mad woman . While it does n't say very much about Goya what it does say is nice even if superficial and pretty irrelevant . once had a late night drunken conversation where my friends and asked each other if you could choose a director to depict your life who would it be ? On his record Forman would sadly have to be at the bottom of my list .
2488_1.txt,0, was expecting a documentary covering the to era of Sci and received a big ol commercial laced with leftist political innuendo by James Cameron and movie mogul baby boomer's pushing the own works . the Skies has in the past referred to the Bug and Exploration movies from the including such favorites as Earth vs. the Flying Saucers Thing from Another World'' and Forbidden Planet'' as well as Them'' Deadly Mantis'' and Tarantula'' There are lower budget examples that rarely get mentioned like Space Monster'' to the Moon'' and Cosmic Man'' This would have been a much better documentary had the few remaining actors directors stunt men and collectors plus the non from the era been interviewed . only wish there was a rating available since a is much to generous .
3794_4.txt,0, went to see this nights ago here in Cork Ireland . It was the world premiere of it in the tiny cinema in the Triskel Arts Centre as part of the Cork Film Festival . found Strange Fruit'' to be an excellent movie . It is a bit rough around the edges but for a low movie that is to be expected ! In general the acting from the main lead Kent Faulcon is wonderful the cinematography and direction excellent and the script hugely entertaining and thought with some nice set and witty dialogue . The ending was a bit sudden with no conclusion given to characters and events once the finale came to its gripping end but perhaps that's what the filmmakers were going for ? It certainly did make the movie more unsettling . did like the fact that the main character never came to terms with his mother on screen it leaves you wondering whether or not he ever will as in real sometimes these things are never settled . This was a good choice to leave it unresolved rather than sentimentally wrapping it up ! Taut and suspenseful throughout Strange Fruit'' is a hugely ambitious debut and have high hopes for what the writer Kyle Schickner will unleash next . He and his colleagues are a talent worth watching . hope Strange Fruit'' gets a wider release soon as more people deserve to see this movie an above thriller with some original and insightful twists on homophobia and racism in America's Deep South . Highly Recommended
12253_3.txt,0, Well must say initially found this short to be quite average but having watched it nearly times since constantly shown on IFC I've developed an enjoyment of the simple plot elements and reality of the situations presented . Sofia Coppola contributes a solid addition to the category .
4207_2.txt,0, caught this movie a few years ago one night and it was one of the funniest movies have ever seen . However since it is supposed to be an action movie can not give it more stars since the humor was unintentional . Chuck Norris plays a truck driver who comes home from the road to see his family and within the first five minutes the conflict arises which leads Chuck to seek vengeance for the rest of the film . Good thing too the sub acting by everyone involved was starting to get old very fast . Actually the judge was pretty good but ca n't really describe what makes him work you'll have to check it out for yourself . And the custom van Chuck Norris drives is hideously classic !
11027_4.txt,0, Carole Lombard and James Stewart gamely try to inject some life and meaning into this bizarrely constructed film about the tribulations of a newlywed couple . The scenes play as if they were parceled out among various directors each with a different goal . Some are Capra some screwball some melodramatic and some surprisingly noir . There's even an extended adventure sequence when the plot suddenly focuses on a small plane flying through a blizzard . It's hard to say which scenes are the most incongruous when the film as a whole is so erratic in tone and the storyline not exactly believable . Only worth watching for film students or fans of the actors smaller parts such as Judge Doolittle and the intrepid pilot are also very well played .
8473_4.txt,0, remember waiting to be born . Vision quest that was the American West . We went to a psychic . I'm sure their first reaction is that she's cuckoo'' place is haunted . think there's another dimension right here . An artist Becket and her husband many decades ago left the hustle and bustle and culture of New York and moved to a god town with a population of in Death Valley . There they renovated a theater it is a very home art manner . And once finished she bega putting on dancing performances for practically no one . In many ways it's highly reminiscent of the Werner Herzog film FITZCARRALDO or FIELD OF DREAMS AMARGOSA is a documentary of a real person a mythical crazy man like Klaus Kinski or Kevin Costner . Her husband eventually leaves of it apparently because of the lifestyle she chose . So today she lives on with her ten cats and a sanctuary for burros eventually along with her new male companion Tom . What you think about this documentary depends on your perspectives . If you are into New Age ideas and open to these sensibilities then you'll more likely appreciate the film . Her talking about how she remembers her birth ghosts vision quests and psychics frankly made the psychology teacher in me cringe and this would definitely be the case for many people . In addition her burro sanctuary and trying to preserve horses in the desert will most likely appeal to PETA and many other animal lovers though with my background in environmental concerns and biology see the burros and horses as a blight that would destroy the native plants and animals . So on two different accounts tend to think quite the opposite of Marta is more of a feeler'' and sensing'' individual . Depending on how you feel about all this will definitely color your opinions am pretty sure most people will either think she's a genius or a nut ! You'll just have to guess what think . Now despite all this the film is interesting and Marta's life is definitely NOT dull since in recent years people have actually begun taking trips to the desert to see her perform . There is a definite following for her and her unusual little world . While would not be nearly as positive as most reviews also ca n't be as negative as the one review as there is definite merit to this odd documentary . like films about unusual people and Marta certainly is unusual ! also appreciate her love of her art and happy life is a rare gift . teach psychology at an arts school and it sure would be interesting to show this to the staff am pretty sure we'd get a strong positive and negative reaction to the film depending on whether the teachers taught the arts classes or core curriculum ! It sure would be interesting . By the way and am not trying to be sarcastic but when Marta's husband was having affairs with whom did this occur ? After all they lived in the middle of no where and was left wondering where he'd find partners . By the way if you'd like to see her perform and stay at her hotel it can be found at www . The site is in English French and German and hotel rates are pretty reasonable as are ticket prices .
2044_4.txt,0, The film is somewhat entertaining but the greatest feature is Shalom Harlow's laughable performance . It has been years since this movie was released and hopefully Harlow has gone through more training . Perhaps she should stick to the more worldly somewhat corruptive characters that she has generated in other performances .
9142_4.txt,0, What a disappointment ! I've enjoyed the Jon Cleary books about Scobie Malone but there's little resemblance between him and the cinematic Malone . In the books he's a city detective who is devoted to his wife and does n't get involved in fisticuffs . For the film the character has been spiced up into an outback copper who uses his fists and is n't averse to jumping into bed with a gorgeous girl though quite what she and the film's other sex interest see in him do n't know Taylor was at the time and his face was getting puffy . But his character's stamina is remarkable he flies in from Australia apparently goes straight to the Commissioner's house unwisely seeking to arrest him during a black reception saves him from assassination into a fight in the process goes to a casino with one girl leaves with another and takes her to bed . So much for jet lag ! On the way back to the Commissioner's house a good knowledge of London back streets he gets beaten up by the baddies but is still first down to breakfast ! It's also remarkable that the commissioner's limo has its windscreen and headlights miraculously repaired within minutes of the assassination attempt and that one character has a touching faith in the precise timekeeping of a clock bomb . The best thing is Joseph the Butler's disdain for the uncouth Malone . And at least the film avoids being a London travelogue though some scenes take place during the Wimbledon tennis week .
1133_1.txt,0, was out visiting an old friend . After dinner talking he expressed some reservations about his daughter's boy friend . She's beautiful smart athletic and the young man is also from an excellent family nice also athletic not as smart told him he might just be feeling the normal fatherly concerns however a few minutes later the young man arrived with his DVD of this flick which he had apparently been anxious for some time to share with the others . These folks have a bona fide home theater set with a screen something in excess of feet and the two young folks preceded to view it while the young swain proceeded to extol its virtues almost frame saw enough in a few moments with some fascination in its awfulness to endorse all of the most critical comments I've seen in scanning some here . told my friend would n't go so far as to disqualify the young suitor solely on the basis of his liking this opus but it certainly seems to warrant his bearing close watch . Some flicks are so the classic Plan from Outer Space and in my opinion the wonderfully awful Bruce Jenner People work Ca n't Stop the Music . However this one remains firmly simply in the awful category . Second bananas'' even the best of these Tim Conway Don Knotts everybody with Seinfeld have great difficulty in carrying a later starring series as here film And these were great supporting characters in their original situations . The Eddie'' character really at about the or level in the prior Griswald movies and never added a whole lot to these in my opinion . Randy Quaid is a capable actor who has delivered some good performances . His contribution to the prior Vacation'' pic's was average at best . Both he and the other cast members many of whom have done some good work in the past accomplished nothing for their efforts here except to derive a few years house payments or some IRA contributions . This whole presentation story performances lead to support could n't be worse .

It is truly beautiful and hearkens back to and architecture like the Hotel Del Coronado . know it was on either Big Bear Lake or Lake Arrowhead and would like to hear if it is still in existence . As for the movie itself it is truly amazing that Jane Wyman was even nominated for an Academy Award . This must have been a period when she was well liked by her Academy peers . It really would have been interesting to get a true impression from Wyman and the other actors in this movie regarding the script . The script of this movie like the recent Kevin Costner movie with a message in a bottle is so unbelievable that it it limits the credibility that the actors can bring to their parts . Rock Hudson can be forgiven . He was never a great actor was able to get by mostly on his looks and did n't get credible roles until later in his career Maids is the exception But Wyman must have been forced to take this movie through contractual requirements or the studio system .
7851_4.txt,0, German emigree and uber actor Paul Muni who never saw a scene he did n't want to chew up goes blackface'' to play a humble Mexican immigrant living in Los Angeles and working his way up in the world . If this creaky vehicle reminds anyone of Al Pacino's minstrel performance as an uncultured Cuban in the remake of SCARFACE do n't be too surprised . The characters are quite similar and both get wildly pop when the script calls for it . Hispanics everywhere should be greatly offended by Muni's over performance as this giddy Mexican living the American dream consequences be damned . guess Benicio DelToro's grandfather was n't available . young bleached Bette Davis plays one of Muni's love interests she eventually goes insane for love of Mr. Meh Muni . An absolute hoot Davis is the sole reason to watch this racially offensive claptrap . There is an absolutely delirious near the end when Muni asks the gal of his dreams to marry him a white gal of breeding with one of those stilted stage accents that Hollywood loved so much and she calls him a savage and a brute of different tribe . Muni immediately transforms into Mr. Hyde and chases her to an untimely death . In the final scene a repentant Muni tells his sober priest that he is going back to his own people his own kind . End of movie . Finis . That's all she wrote . Muni was said to have hired a gen Mexican as a chauffeur in order to study this exotic creature's speech pattern and physical habits . Yowza !
7057_4.txt,0, One of the most pleasant surprises of this early Technicolor short was that a ballet dancer that appears here was named Maria Gambarelli ! half wondered if Blake Edwards was naming the character played by Elke Sommer in Shot in the Dark after this now performer the spelling of the Sommer character's surname was actually Gambrelli watched this on YouTube mainly to see an early Judy Garland appearance as we watch her in profile with her two older sisters singing La Cucaracha'' That was the highlight for me which otherwise showed some dances that of Ms. Gambarelli that were enjoyable and some lame comedy between Andy Devine as a great bull right ! and Buster Keaton as a bull owner who provides one that is obviously a man in animal costume . Only funny part of those two is when they cry Buster providing handkerchief to bull'' the sad part of La Cucaracha'' Also lame was seeing Ted Healy without his stooges dealing with a crasher who keeps mistaking Healy for other movie stars . himself did n't know Zeppo had left The Marx Brothers since he puts Four'' between The'' and Marx'' Speaking of a Marx it was interesting seeing Harpo without his wig though he is wearing a hat to hide his bald head . Also interesting was seeing Ida Lupino among the cowgirls in the beginning though also recognized Toby Wing from her part in Murder at the Vanities last year least when announcer Pete Smith identified her Oh and Smith himself was n't funny with his wise narration . Other famous stars you may or may not recognize are also in cameos and not all are contract players either ! So with all that said La fiesta de Santa Barbara is worth a look for anyone curious about Judy Garland's early film appearances or the early use of Technicolor .

My friend grabbed Head of the Family and we were greeted by a head sitting in a wheelchair . Well that set us off laughing and we decided to have a bet to see who would be the one who had to go to the desk and pay for the movie . Well you guessed it it was me ! have never been so embarrised in all my life . We got home and put it on and we rolled about the floor laughing for about because this was the funniest film in the world . cant remember much about it but one thing do remember was the blonde girl getting it on with some guy in the back of a shop every mins . That head made me laugh and when look at other peoples comments aboout this movie it makes me laugh even more . Head of the family is so good and the head is funny and im still laughing ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
479_3.txt,0, Written by directed by and starring the champ of camp Bruce Campbell . Easy on its easy to tell this is a budget on a shoestring affair filmed independently in Bulgaria . All can really say for sure is that silly is not always funny . Campbell plays an affluent American business man with a cheating wife Byron trying to close a business transaction before he is murdered . He hires a cabbie to drive him around a strange little town not knowing that his wife is on with the taxi driver . Within moments of Campbell being bludgeoned the cabbie is killed in the same location . mad scientist Keach with an experiment putting the cabbie's brain inside the American's head . With massive stitches on his forehead Campbell breaks free and roams the streets looking for his wife all the while he is arguing with a strange voice inside his over head . Campbell contorts his rubbery face making silly expressions as he argues with himself . Thus Bruce is doing what he does best and no doubt his many fans will be pleased . get the impression this must have been written as a straight comedy . Rounding out the cast are Ted Raimi Tamara Gorski and Vladmir Kolev . Watch for this on the Sci Channel .
256_4.txt,0, On Humphrey Bogart's first trip to Hollywood he got his first leading man role in this picture Love Affair . The first thing you ought to realize is that this film has absolutely nothing to do with the classic Love Affair later in the decade with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne or the two remakes that followed . It's not half as good any of those films . In fact Bogey is second billed to Dorothy Mackaill as a spoiled heiress who finds out she's been living her extravagant lifestyle courtesy of her late father's best friend and financial adviser Hale Hamilton . It comes as quite a shock to Mackaill . She considers a show business career as a way for an income . Bogart is a test pilot who is also an aeronautical engineer and he's designing an ultimate airplane motor and is looking for investors . Mackaill is willing to do it besides she likes what she sees in Bogey . Considering the cynical roles that Bogart later made a specialty it's a bit disconcerting to see him as this highly moral and self righteous character in Love Affair . The part does n't wear well on him . Love Affair is your average program second feature nothing terribly special about it .
8429_3.txt,0, Disappointing'' is the best word could think for this film especially considering the glowing reviews it receives from some other users . One thing that really spoils the film is that it is unabashedly partial both senses of the word Not only does it present a very selective description of the games as it does on the US athletics team but it also contains several inaccuracies most of which serve to exaggerate the difficulties the US team faced . What is even more disturbing is that all the omissions and mistakes appear to glorify US sportsmanship to the exclusion of other athletes a few celebrated exceptions For example the viewer is led to believe that the US won the majority of medals in the Games when in fact they won only one out of four gold medals and one out of total . Similarly many athletes are portrayed as caricatures of their respective countrymen we have an arrogant Brit and a wine French This attitude does very little service to the Olympic ideals that the film is supposed to celebrate . In conclusion believe that this film would appeal to that part of the US audience that is looking for a quick boost of national self Those looking for a detailed and historically correct description of the games are advised to look elsewhere .
7829_4.txt,0, Olivier Assayas film stars Asia Argento as a woman who had a relationship with Michael Madsen . Madsen is a business man who's in financial trouble . In desperation he is going to sell his share of a business to a company called Golden Eagle a company from the Far East . As Madsen begins his moves away from his company Asia Argento returns to his life . The pair had a torrid love affair that included her doing business favors for Madsen said Golden Eagle Once Argento enters the film the film follows her as we see the tangled web she's woven and how the complications spin dangerously and violently out of control . I'm not a fan . Actually was quite bored as the film seems to go from pillar to post for much of the first hour during which kept wondering what the point was other than to provide a meaty role for Argento . Argento daughter of director Dario Argento and a director in her own right is a unique actress . At times stunningly good she is more often then not going to give you a quirky off beat portrayal of a damaged human being . Sometimes it works and sometimes it does n't . do n't think it completely works here mostly because the script is too complicated'' to support it . did n't care what was going on so her wounded girl just rubbed me the wrong way seemed more nut job than anything else I'm not blaming the actors but writer Assayas who has once again constructed a complicated tale with the sort of parts actors love to tackle but which leave audiences scratching their heads because they they do n't really work . If you must try it on cable
9864_4.txt,0, As long as you keep in mind that the production of this movie was a copyright ploy and not intended as a serious release it is actually surprising how not absolutely horrible it is . even liked the theme music . And if ever a flick cried out for a treatment by Joel Mike and the MST Bots this is it ! Watch this with a bunch of smart wise and you're in for a good time . Have a brew butter up some large pretzels and enjoy . Of course obtaining a copy requires buying a bootleg or downloading it as shareware but if you're here on the IMDb then you're most likely savvy enough to do so . Good luck . And look for my favorite part . Dr. Doom informs the FF that they have hours to comply with his wishes . he actually gestures the number with his finger while doing so . like Evil Sesame Street'' boy . of course Mrs. Storm declaring Just look at you . Fanstastic Four'' is just so heartwarming . laugh you'll cry . So if you love schlocky Sci this one's Fantastic For you !
8430_2.txt,0, remember watching this mini the first time in with a growing sense of anger and indignation . Having read the comments on this title must agree with those from the people in Greece . This was produced to coincide with the Los Angeles Olympic Games and to me it seemed like nothing more than an exercise in jingoistic flag American nationalism in which the American athletes are glorified at everyone else's expense . Some other nationalities would have every right to feel deeply insulted at the way they were portrayed in this series . It may however help to explain the way in which many American spectators behaved at the Los Angeles Olympics and the TV coverage which seemed only interested in events that Americans were likely to win .

Also confusing is the fact that is given as the copyright dates on both films . Perhaps that was the year they were American According to the release dates given on IMDb Tragic Hero'' was released before Rich and Famous'' Was there any reason for releasing the sequel first ? Despite some users comments enjoyed these films although they are n't among CYF's best such as The Killer'' and Hard which are truly astonishing . However one day come across a set of Rich and Famous'' and Tragic Hero'' wo n't hesitate to buy it . Hopefully these comments about Black Vengeance'' clear up which was also for me a mystery as to where it belonged in Chow Yun filmography .

4841_3.txt,0, This is said to be the first Polish western and is written and directed by Piotr Uklanski . Known in the as DEAD MAN'S BOUNTY this film uses some strange visuals to tell a story that is short on dialog . Val Kilmer plays a corpse and some scenes are through his dead eyes . Some awkward visual situations are actually comical in a sick way . My favorite is a young man building a gallows chops off one of his own fingers and actually hangs himself testing the strength of the rope . cowboy known only as stranger Roden a dead man that he thinks is a wanted man . He takes him to the nearest town to collect the bounty . He ends up losing the corpse and the potential bounty in a gambling game with the town's drunken sheriff Linda has the few townsmen turned against him when he has a dalliance with the barmaid Figura He manages to escape sure death and leads the small posse on a dangerous goose chase One scene has the stranger tending to a scalp wound by cauterizing with gunpowder and a match . The corpse rots chained to a hitching post as the sheriff finds out that there is no bounty to be had . This movie also known as SUMMER LOVE has a haunting theme song sung by John Davidson . Nevertheless this western is like watching a train wreck . There is just something that tells you not to look . you do .

Great chunks of what makes The Lord Of The Rings what it is is simply ignored . Even special effects ca n't do Tolkien's your own imagination justice .

9633_4.txt,0, Strained and humorless in light of its rather dubious psychology but well and comfortably lurid this genteel body count movie highlights the unusually hypnotic presence of Angharad Rees as a young woman periodically possessed by Jack the Ripper thus allowing for some nasty gore effects amidst the Edwardian propriety . It's all pretty standard stuff for Hammer but is handled with a good deal of visual elan even if the central relationship between psychoanalyst Porter and Rees drives the narrative without ever being satisfactorily explained .
626_4.txt,0, Irwin Allen's first venture into all star spectacle was one all star disaster . The Story of Mankind contains some of the most incredible casting decisions of all time . Virginia Mayo as the blond Cleopatra Dennis Hopper chewing the scenery with Napoleon Peter Lorre dining on the scenery for weeks as Nero Marie Wilson as Marie Antoinette as a roadshow Marilyn Monroe that's just some of them . The film also is known for being the last film which featured all three of the Marx Brothers though they all have different roles . Chico plays a monk who is Christopher Columbus's confidante Groucho euchres the Indians out of Manhattan island as Peter Minuit and most astonishing of all Harpo Marx as Sir Isaac Newton who discovers gravity when an apple conks him on the bean . Holding all these portrayals together is a story where mankind itself is being judged . super Bomb is about to be discovered and let loose will do in the world's population . It's Judgement Day a coming . But mankind has its advocates and detractors . Speaking for the prosecution is Old Scratch who's been bringing the worst out in man for centuries in the form of Vincent Price . But man has his good side as well and who better than Ronald Colman to demonstrate man at his most civilized best . Colman and Price plead their case before The Judge played by Cedric Hardwicke . In those three individuals you have some of the finest speaking voices the English language ever knew . When the film is on them as they each bring out the exhibits for their case it's a pleasure to listen to . Then when the focus is on the individual stories you want to scream in agony . What was Irwin Allen driving at I'm still trying to figure it out . Was he deliberately camping it up with some of these casting decisions ? If it was satire it just does n't get off the ground . This was Ronald Colman's farewell film and while it's hardly something I'd like to go out on ca n't think of any man who could have stated the case for civilization any better . So when you see The Story of Mankind fast forward through some of the exhibits and treasure every moment the advocates are before the judge .
10166_4.txt,0, This review is for the UK DVD three box set . Disc one is called Caught in the Act and contains Model Behavior Chasing Jamie and Fast and Curious . Disc two is called Bedroom Fantasies and contains Blue Plate Special Falling in Lust Again and Love Potion No . The final disc is called Anything Goes and contains Chatroom She's the Boss and Legally Yours . Why the other four episodes in the series are not included is a mystery because there is surely enough room on the discs for a lot more material . Each episode opens with the hotel manager Chloe Hayes reading a letter from a satisfied customer . We then get to see the story unfolding as the guests check into the hotel . Blue Plate Special is the exception because this story is from a waitress . The writers should be given credit for coming up with a good variety of story lines . For instance Model Behavior is about two models vying for the attention of the photo crew Falling in Lust Again is about a man and woman who parted and rekindle their love when they meet up again at the hotel She's the Boss is about a put male secretary who shows that he is more of a man than his female boss realised much to her pleasure . All the episodes lead up to lots of nudity and sex . It should come as no surprise that all the characters in this hotel are beautiful women and handsome hunks . Even the geeky secretaries get transformed when they remove their spectacles and let their hair down . The sex action is plentiful but to me seems too frantic and false . The camera work could also have done with a bit of moderation spending too much time close up and so moving about to capture everything and as usual we get loud music during the sex action . Finally the end credits mention the Palm Canopy Hotel Singer Island Florida although my map of Florida shows no Singer Island . The scenery certainly looks more like Florida than Utah or Las Vegas that some people have mentioned . This is quite a good effort and it is a pity that the second series is still awaiting a UK DVD release . stars .

9940_1.txt,0, Heftig og Begeistret and Enthusiastic is a documentary story of a male choir up in Berlev in the very northern part of Norway where the weather is cold and hostile the days are dark during the winter and the towns are faced with young people moving to the more populated parts in the south of Norway where the climate is warmer and there are more opportunities . The most beautiful part of this movie is the humans themselves . The people in the choir who are aged from to all have unique colorful lives and are very enjoyable beings . They are characterised by the harsh climate and the recession of the North and have adapted to the way of living required . Throughout the movie we learn a bit about many people in the choir and we follow them through songs some events in a church and on the harbour and in the end a trip to Murmansk . The outside environment filmed in the movie is very beautiful and characterised by the Norwegian nature . The scenography is also natural and taken directly from the choir and from the peoples lives that we meet . Thei livingrooms the bathroom the kettle on the oven there is nothing artificial about this movie not the people not the environment not their music and not their feelings . Everything is as real as can be . It all loses out though when it comes to giving a story . It is very beautiful and real but why do we see it ? Is it because of the songs ? Is it because of the nature ? Or is it simply just to see a story about Berlev Mens about their life and some of the trips they have . The message if there is any is that this small society copes with life through such social events like the choir . The choir have kept the people together for many many years . It is all nice but being as popular as it has been seen by almost in Norway there is something wrong . There is no beginning or end to it . Nobody gains or loses anything nobody reveals any message or tries to convince the audience of that this is good or that life up there is great . Why was this movie made ? am sorry . It is a nice movie about good people but compared to the average European Scandinavian or Norwegian movie this does not deserve a out of It is closer to out of and that is what will give it . If you see this movie in a theater you should expect the average age on the audience to be around It has reported to be consistently high in all theaters . Maybe this is also the reason for it receiving such very high praise in the news and good grades also on the IMDB It is a movie about elders for elders . It is a movie of regret nothing in my life'' and a story saying that living in a small town like Berlev might be a nice life too .

It must be said that the acting and interpretation is most heavily polluted by the TV trend to speak in a severely muffled voice not moving lips straining tones as emerged in the That's real life'' and Let's audience The late Massimo Girotti towers upon the other characters for intensity clarity of expression and intellectual honesty . The movie has some good hints but in another comment before mine it lacks a focal point and dribbles away in many plot of lesser and lesser relevance another trend dragged in from the TV productions well known to Italians . few drops in style could be spared to the public such as the patisserie drag and aesthetics of cooking plus sensual payload of sweets see Chocolat Babette's lunch Vatel etc . Hammam and the Fairies are definitely more truthful seems that Ozpetek has learned the tune of Italy in the early and is humming along . I'll give him a last chance though .
9200_3.txt,0, really enjoyed the film . It was really cheesy at times . destroy the villain with hair driers where are they plugged in ? It's a unique film though and enjoyed the acting of Courtney Draper and Tamara Hope . also enjoyed Fanuel you write it . liking Megan's charecter because she called him a dweeb . Besides the acting the rewinding'' and showing what happened on Ariel's and then Megan's point of view was quite interesting . saw it twice and I'd see it again

12049_4.txt,0, Empty shortening of John Irving's novel strives for profundity courageously but ends up being absurd . It's a quirky goofy and bittersweet string of sketches attempting to explain a man's growth from birth to adulthood and how he deals with the vices of lust and fanaticism that surround him . Garp is born to a formidable unmarried mother Jenny Fields played by Glenn Close . various stages of Garp's childhood are played by three young actors before Robin Williams takes over as Garp reaches adulthood . The story follows him through childhood at a boys prep school where Jenny is the school nurse through his high school passions sex marriage with his high school sweetheart children marital problems and a writing career . Jenny meanwhile has become a famous feminist espousing an unorthodox cause . The plot details an abundance of comic and tragicomic episodes and outlandish adventures . Williams gives a cherub performance . This script was not fitting for his wildness and anarchy and thus his talent was wasted . He's like an injured bird sputtering out of control . John Lithgow's role as a father like transsexual imparting wisdom also does n't make sense . This movie was able to attract some reasonable attention in due to the popularity of Robin Williams and his new entry into movies . Williams had recently shed his Mork and Mindy pursuits and focused more on stand comedy and movies . Audiences were confused by this film especially by its arbitrary and inexplicable ending .
1894_4.txt,0, Yes this bizarre feature was written by John Sayles . Shot in Toronto it's yet another era feature about the dangers of the urban jungle where the police fear to go and the homeless and the criminal classes are the only inhabitants . Into this mix comes the myth of Wild Thing a feral young man raised by a bag lady after his parents were murdered by a dirty cop on the take Chaykin and Chopper the local crime lord Davi Stir in the local do Sean Hewitt and clueless social worker Kathleen Quinlan and you have a recipe for some rather unexciting action sequences . Davi is the standout amongst the cast and cinematographer Rene Verzier does a pretty good job . Otherwise this is a rather lumpen action pic that wo n't satisfy action fans and will leaves Sayles admirers slack
1874_1.txt,0, You know as you get older you somehow think the movies you did not like when you were younger might have been because of your youth and inexperience . Case in point when saw The Godfather at age thought it was boring . years later its an incredible movie to me . In other words grew up and began to appreciate great movies . So rented Dirty Dancing with my girlfriend last night on her request as she loved it at age and hated it at the same age . But hoped because was young and stupid at age perhaps this would be a new experience for me . So sat down with her to watch hoping to be enlightened . Well the night after watching Dirty Dancing feel a violation . feel like someone reached into my soul and robbed me of hours of my life from watching this cheese fest . First Patrick Swayze plays a year old but he looks like he is And the premise of the movie is him seducing some underage teenager wooing her with his dance moves . Really Creepy . Anyway the movie is the clich plot where the wrong side of the tracks'' guy and the rich smart girl'' accidentally fall in love with each other . Of course their romance is fueled by the fact the rich girl'' ca n't dance a lick so the poor hero'' teaches her in a week to become an expert dancer for the big end of vacation show or something like that . But you guessed it The disapproving father soon enters and forbids the two to see each other and the movie progresses to secret meetings of dance lessons and love making . This all culminates into the final scene where the entire resort rallies around the two young lovers while the once antagonistic father accepts the year old dancer as his teen daughter's new man . Even my girlfriend whimpered at the end of the movie as she admitted it was not anything like she remembered . did n't press her but did smirk a little and put the Godfather part II in the DVD player .
11728_2.txt,0, Totally forgettable movie but an unbelievable soundtrack I'd give it out of have the CD and the guitar work Lofgren is superb ! saw the movie years ago and had to check IMDb to remember what it was about . obsessed about getting the soundtrack and have since had to replace it . It ranges from blues to a dose of gospel . All songs written arranged produced and performed by Nils Lofgren who is the other'' lead guitarist opposite Steve Van Zandt in the Street Band . This dude can play ! The vocals are handled by Nils ca n't sing very good raspy Bonnie Sheridan is a great singer and Tom Lepson .
2477_2.txt,0, This is a comedy movie directed by Andy Tennant starring Will Smith Eva Mendes and Kevin James . It is about a professional dating doctor Smith known as who helps men to land dates with the women they are interested in . He is currently helping a shapely clumsy Albert who is obsessed with a very powerful famous and rich woman called Allegra . At the same time Hitch has become interested in a gossip columnist Sara Eva Mendes who has been assigned to write about Allegra . When the best girlfriend of Sara has a love disillusion with a man that Sara thinks that is a client of Hitch she plots a revenge against Hitch and the misunderstanding leads the two couples to a conflictive situation This film is not one that men should see as it has a lot of male and both subtle and blatant male There are also double standards that you would have to be blind not to spot . Hitch and Sara are both very guarded around the opposite sex Hitch still likes women despite his burns from them in the past and is teaching men to make them happy . But of course Sara is a sexist bigot who makes frequent sexist comments along the lines of men want to have sex with anything that walks . Shes self and knows she looks like a goddess and knows there are no men out there . What annoyed me most of all was the guy who wanted a quick fumble with Sara's best friend who is the classic example of a defenceless and even after being turned down physically by Hitch receives as blow to the pills from Sara after which she says Now I'm satisfied . Add to that the women are still oppressed'' vibes you get from Allegra not being allowed to spend her own money after asking permission from a table of men . In spite of all the rubbish assumptions and generalisations Women can always tell when you ai n't being straight with them ? this movie does have the correct point that in America love simply does n't exist . There are some funny parts in this film such as Albert and his dancing habits but this film overall only beats the dreadful film Honey by a marginal amount .
7968_4.txt,0, Lina McLaidlaw is a bright solitary young women who falls unexpectedly in love with Johnnie Aysgarth a highly eligible bachelor with a penchant for losing money . They get married but almost at once Lina is subjected to Johnnie's addiction to lying gambling and getting into debt . Despite his flaws she is unable to resist his charming manner until she starts to suspect he may be harbouring murderous thoughts toward her This is a good movie well with an attractive cast a good script and possibly the single lousiest ending in movie history . Okay that's maybe going too far but not by much . Lots of films change the ending of a book Expectations The Shining etc but the last two scenes of this one not only manage to be horribly lame but also render the entire preceding plot completely meaningless . The story is about a woman whose husband is driven by his greed and moral lacking and what she knows about him to kill her . It should end it does in Francis Iles Anthony Berkeley's book Before The Fact with him attempting to murder her . The reason it does n't is that the studio forced Hitch to reshoot the ending one of the first examples of the godawful process of preview audience testing . Hitch was canny and did what he was told was only his third film in Hollywood knowing that if he played the game sooner or later he would gain creative control of his films evinced by his masterpieces of the fifties . But that still leaves us with a turkey of an ending . This is a great shame because it really is a very good movie with an intriguing theme does anyone really know their husband or wife that well The script is excellent with many off moments as when Lina's father dies and Johnnie assumes she's crying about it a finely performance by Grant never played a villain again and fine photography throughout culminating in the famous glass shot . Fontaine won an Oscar for this performance although personally prefer her confusion and vulnerability in her earlier victimised wife role in Rebecca . would like to rate this movie higher but really ca n't forgive that ending this is what happens when movies are made for money not love which guess is curiously the theme of the film itself . Look fast for Hitchcock's cameo as a man posting a letter .
7988_1.txt,0, This vicious little film is horrendous . My low rating for it comes for two main reasons . The first is that it is an animal snuff film and find that whole concept so vile it turns my stomach . Filmed over a hundred years ago can only hope that we've evolved into something a little more humane and compassionate . This film is complete and utter exploitation made to cash in on the sensational aspects of the film and the subject . Historical interest aside this is something to watch only if one finds themselves in the grip of morbid fascination . Reason number two ? Look at the way that the camera is set up . It is placed in the best possible location to fully capture the full effect long march forward of the elephant perfect view of the electrocution platform and a cold and clinically dispassionate viewpoint of the elephant with smoke coming out of it before it finally collapses . Sickening . Thomas Edison did many great things for civilization and his talents and intelligence are n't in doubt . Nobody is perfect but when you realize that this film provided an opportunity for him to trump early cinematic competitors with a sensationalist film of an elephant being electrocuted and he filmed the execution to demonstrate the greater effectiveness of DC as opposed to AC you ca n't help but wonder if the scientist in him was a little TOO dispassionate and cold . Any number of Peter Cushing's mad scientists would be proud . The rest of us should be ashamed and revolted .

10046_4.txt,0, This is one of those strange self self movies which tries too hard to be profound . It is n't . Instead it spouts cliches that try to pass for Profundity . Typical is the scene where Peter Grammer explains to protagonist and best friend Adam Brown how man starts life breast feeding then moves on to sucking the breast of his girlfriend and finally his wife thus concluding ultimately that life sucks . So deep . We are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life the universe etc . during Adam's travels through the Mojave Desert on foot . abruptly leaves the day of his wedding and his family friends and fiance assume he's dead when his car was found in a military test range smashed by a rocket . Some characters are more entertaining than others . The best by far is an escapee from a mental hospital who only speaks through the voices of others . The actor James Kevin Ward does some great impressions including Nicholson Popeye and several characters from the original Star Trek . But once the interesting characters leave the screen we're stuck with Adam again and his pursuit of the profound . It's a long trip which drags in many places . In fact it's the longest hour and a half movie I've ever seen . And the finale hardly makes it seem worth while at all . discovered this movie playing on HBO one day by waking up too early and clicking on the TV . That'll learn me . Next time I'll try harder to sleep in .
9510_3.txt,0, Franco Zeffirelli's Taming Of The Shrew Romeo And Juliet Jesus Of Nazareth Othello'' third stab at transferring Shakespeare to the screen works very well with the casting of Mel Gibson Max Lethal Weapon'' and pre Passion Of The Christ'' notoriety in the role formerly owned by Sir Laurence Olivier rightly so see my review on his Hamlet arguably the best interpretation of one of the Bard's timeless most quoted tragedies and redone years later by Kenneth Branagh as a full treatment explaining its hour minute running time combined with a dream cast a lot of little additions which were well and expertly done by the contemporary master of William Shakespeare Kenneth Branagh the director of Henry and Dead Again . Joining the Lethal Weapon'' star are Glenn Close Big Chill'' Paul Scofield Man For All Seasons'' Alan Bates Ian Holm Michael Maloney would be cast as Roderigo opposite Kenneth Branagh and Laurence Fishburne in Oliver Parker's Othello'' my review of Olivier's stage'' version of the tragedy though he only starred in it and who Branagh would cast as Laertes in HIS version of Hamlet'' proper homage to Sir Laurence Olivier and his classic version of the play see my review on that one as well years later Nathaniel Parker would be cast as Cassio in his brother's version of Othello'' years later and Helena Bonham who would be cast in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein'' years later . Zeffirelli intended this movie as a homage to Sir Laurence Olivier had died years prior to this movie and it works pretty well for the most part . What was slightly uncomfortable with was Zeffirelli's misplacing a lot of lines and in one scene he gives one of Hamlet's lines to the Ghost . Also Helena Bonham DID NOT convince me as Ophelia . She was too dull and unreal whereas Jean Simmons had immortalized the role in Olivier's version and Kate Winslet did an acceptable job in Kenneth Branagh's uncut epic revisionist reworking of Hamlet'' were good in the role with Jean Simmons being the BEST Ophelia ever that's why she was nominated for Best Actress in did n't win a shame Ian Holm said his lines too quickly not slowly as expected him to in a scene with him Laertes and Ophelia . But then again I'm more used to Felix Aylmer and Richard Briers interpretations of the role and think that they did better jobs than Holm in their respective versions of Hamlet'' done by great directors actors text producers AND stars of all their versions of the Bard's work as Polonius . The rest of the cast however was excellent . The scene where Hamlet confronts his mother was very well done but Olivier and Branagh heightened the scene to better lengths to create even more emotional intensity and suspense that the scene required . recommend this version just to pass the time but it's ideal as a teaching tool for English teachers recommend showing Olivier's version first then Branagh's and finally this version Despite the film's PG'' rating there was really nothing objectionable in the movie . Only what the play called for . The Best Versions Of Hamlet'' Are Sir Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh . Both were so good that ca n't decide which one was the best . See my reviews on these versions for more information . Franco Zeffirelli . This one was alright . It started out alright with a scene not in the play but should've then progressed to the actual beginning of the play where a guard cries out Who's there ? Nay answer me . Stand and unfold yourself ! That scene scares the hell out of you because you're sitting quietly and then you almost jump out of your skin . In short that scene sets the tone for the rest of the play . HUGE blunder on Zeffirelli's part to omit that scene . It also misplaced a lot of lines cut others that think should've been put in such as the line where Hamlet says to Ophelia Get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners ? that line was supposed to have occurred in THAT scene NOT where it was placed in the film the To Be Or Not To Be'' soliloquy . This version struggles between cutting out too much or too little from an excellent piece of literature . Kenneth Branagh would remedy that years later with his uncut version of the tragedy making HIS version a more fitting homage to Sir Laurence Olivier as several of the actors from him had performed Hamlet'' on stage on film many times on different occasions . However Zeffirelli's take on Hamlet'' IS faithful to the play and THAT's what was looking for . The setup for the final act duel was the same as in Olivier and Branagh's versions only that the denouement in Branagh's version was more violent than the denouement of the previous two faithful versions in line with the play Olivier toned it down . it worked equally well and stuck more closely to the play with Branagh throwing in a few harmless touches of his own . very good effect . This version is Not Rated .
2514_4.txt,0, Having seen Carlo Lizzani's documentary on Luchino Visconti was bound to higher expectations before watching this film made three years later by Adam Low . But the viewer like me did get dissatisfied . faced a need for critical opinion which generally do n't like giving due to the fact there are no documentaries that will satisfy every viewer . There are also no documentaries that will examine a theme totally . But when read the reviews already written on this title also felt a bit confused . People sometimes do n't know what to criticize . Therefore to be clear I'll divide this film into two major parts that differ considerably the former one about Visconti before his director's career and latter one about Visconti the director . The aristocratic background all the hobbies the wealth that young Luchino experienced and enjoyed are clearly presented . His effort in horse racing is mentioned as well as his relation with his mother so much disturbed after his parents divorce . We also get a very accurate idea of where Luchino was brought up as a real count of Milano in riches galore with nannies cooks with access to everything in TRUE ARISTOCRACY . For instance his father's splendid villa at Grazzano and other marvelous villas prove that . There is also an emphasis on Visconti's crucial visit in Paris in the where he met eminent people wingers'' who later had impact on his style and message in art . That clearly explains the idea of a communist with the aristocratic upbringing contrast at first sight However the part about his director's career which started with OSSESSIONE during WWII and ended with INNOCENTE just before the director's death in is poorly executed . His movies are not discussed well . Why ? Because there are very few people who really have something to say . Franco Zeffirelli the director remembers the works on LA TERRA TREMA and that is all right . There are also some interviews with Franco Rosi . But later such movies like IL GATTOPARDO LA CADUTA DEI REI LA MORTE VENEZIA or LUDWIG are mostly discussed by Helmut Berger . Although liked the actor in the role of Ludwig did not like the interviews of his . Moreover some thoughts he reveals are not accurate to entail in such a documentary . There is no mention of significant works of Visconti like CONVERSATION PIECE there are no interviews with eminent cast Burt Lancaster . mention about Silvana Mangano and Romy Schneider should also be made . There is one footage interview with Maria Callas that appears to be interesting but that is only a short bit . Franco Zeffirelli though appreciate him as a director makes fun of it all rather than says something really precious . For instance he mentions the event how Visconti separated from him after years of service . Therefore say simplified and unsatisfactory . What find a strong point here are footage interviews with Visconti himself . As a result we may get his own opinion about his works . For instance very much appreciate the words he says about death regarding it as a normal chapter of life and as natural as birth itself . He also discusses his health problems after the stroke while filming LUDWIG . believe it is better to see LUCHINO VISCONTI by Carlo Lizzani than this doc . Although it is shorter and condensed as a whole you will get a better idea of the director . Visconti would be furious about that and the fury of his usually turned people's emotions and viewpoints into stone .

Story two culture . guy that might get thrown out by his land lord to how messy his flat is that due to keeping a tuna pasta in his fridge for six months it has now moulded and evolved into a green mouldy version of himself ! while they start off as friends end up having a big falling out leads to a final battle to see if the real guy or his fridge clone will survive . Story three good to be true . girl signs up with a dating agency and she gets matched with a guy the is perfect for her . she is unsure that the guy is too perfect when she thinks that she sees him down she starts to get spooked . View on the film The first thing that have to mention is the rating for the film in england it has been given an eighteen rating thought it has no nudity or blood at all . the other odd thing about all the stories is that they all have happy endings the goodies win ! while the first story is too close to the Stephen King classic Christine second story is easily the highlight of the film director Tom Parkinson making the nuttiness of the story feel like a low Muppets episode ! Final view on the film While it does have a bit of a feel is enough wackiness to make this a good horror

However the soundtrack that was used contained the music of a great heavy metal rock band recognized the music as being a band called Firstryke and the album was Just a Nightmare'' and it was very well written ! and am curious to see what the rest of you movie buffs out there think of it if can remember back that far would appreciate the feed back collect old movie and obscure movie sound tracks . It is a very time consuming hobby but is very rewarding . have seen this bands music being sold in Germany on the net for around fifty dollars per album . Not to bad Hugh ?

12332_4.txt,0, Love Life'' explores a very culturally relevant scenario of a marriage of convenience between a lesbian and a gay man . found the subject matter compelling even if the conflict was a bit forced and too easily resolved . For example Thomas falls for Joe a little too quickly and conveniently for the plot . There are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage Joe's glasses . one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene . In the end found myself more turned by this movie than moved . Stephan Gill has a pretty nice body and shows it all quite a few times with pornstar skill and exuberance and all acting chops to match . Many times the movie seems like it is going to go full porn . Stephanie Kirchen does a fine job but her moment of enlightenment at the end was sullied a bit for me since was in the mood for a good romp in the shower by the end of this movie .

5242_1.txt,0, Once heard that the greatest and oldest preserved Germanic heroic poem was transformed into a film it almost became my obsession to see it . The first glints of its appearance caught never disappointed me . futuristic interpretation With Lambert our favourite highlander and Mitra tomb raider to be leading roles seamed appealing though some doubts came to life important female character in Beowulf ? Two hours ago saw the film . After had read the director's name my world fell apart . As said from that point on there was not many surprises . First and foremost the film has NOTHING to do with the original Beowulf if we disregard a couple of violently and pointlessly stolen names . If they had not stolen the names and declared it to be a new story it might have passed as an action stupidity with nice costumes and scenography . This way it is simply a crime ! An attack on a legend and its ideology as well as on common sense . Ok let me be positive for a second . apart from the general electro atmosphere which is nice it also has good music . That was it for both the positive part and this comment .

But she somehow convinced me that it was a movie worth seeing that if loved movies like Dirty Dancing Take the Lead and Save the Last Dance that should love Step Up eh what the heck ? guess every movie in some way has it's right to a view . Well you know those movies just mentioned up top ? Dirty Dancing Take the Lead and Save the Last Dance ? Well put them in a blender with some gangsta love in it and that's what you have . Not to mention if you've seen those movies well frankly you have seen Step Up . Because Channing is lower class with street smarts who just naturally feels the music while that snobby up class girl must follow step by step how will they ever fall in love if they are so different ? After all this is their chance to step up'' to the passion the mystery and the lust of the dance ! OK that was a silly plot explanation but like said as long as you've seen those movies mentioned or even if you just saw the plot you get the movie . do n't understand how it actually has a rating bet it's those Channing lovers ! LOL ! I'm kidding with you guys but it's all good guess just did n't get what others did with the passion the mystery that is the dance ! Oh Antonio Bandares where are you when we need you ?
2694_2.txt,0, saw this film as a sneak preview before the Venice opening at the Telluride Film Festival . Your reaction to it will largely depend on your attitude about respecting the text of Shakespeare . On the plus side Pacino gives a very good performance indeed as Shylock Lynn Collins is a fine Portia and the film has a sumptuous look . The negatives are predictable . The Merchant of Venice'' is arguably the most difficult of all of Shakespeare's plays to stage today largely because we look at it through the distorting lens of century history . The romantic plot with Bassanio and Portia presents no problem . The character of Shylock does because we lack the original frame of reference of the Elizabethan audience . Shylock is simultaneously a human character with human qualities and motivations and an abstraction of the pitiless quality of the Old Law . When he says Hath not a Jew eyes ? he is a character when he proclaims will have my bond ! he is an abstraction . The long passage on music and cosmic harmony in the final scene moved and cut to ribbons is the key to the play in that it re universal harmony after the disruptive and evil Shylock of the trial scene forces are ejected . It is possible to make psychological sense of the character of Shylock by showing his gradually going mad and turning into a monomaniac by the time the trial scene rolls around key is that at a point he must cease being sympathetic . Pacino's performance almost does it but not quite . The film ca n't quite make up its mind the one hand there is the right movement in the character of Shylock and on the other there is a great deal of extraneous footage of Jews being abused and Venetian whores with rouged nipples doubt to show the decadence of Antonio et al Shakespeare was not writing an Ibsen social drama he was writing a comedy following the classic pattern of disruption of social order and the restoration of social order symbolized by marriage with a theme of love versus law at the center of the Shylock plot . In this sense the film is a travesty surgery on the play and direction almost force us away from what the play really means . the beginning of the final scene cutting most of it and moving it before the trial scene is the most extreme example . There are some other significant difficulties . Jeremy Irons a fine actor plays Antonio as if he were overdosed on sedatives . Joseph Fiennes is pretty but shallow as Bassanio . Most of the actors with the exceptions of Collins Pacino and the actor playing the Duke in the trial scene mumble their dialogue . Final verdict ? pretty film with a few decent performances . It's not Shakespeare it's poor interpretation . Not really worth your time or money Lynn Collins as Portia almost redeems it .
9164_4.txt,0, As cute and adorable as they are the story of three singing chipmunks just does n't seem to have enough meat to it to sustain it for an hour and a half . thought that the first half hour or so of this movie was well worth watching . It was fun it had a few laughs in it it was full of energy . Then it somehow just lost that . would n't even say it faded away because it seemed quite abrupt to me . The fun was gone the laughter disappeared . My daughter noticed it too . She's she laughed uproariously several times in that first part of the movie then her laughter stopped . Perhaps it took on too serious a tone the evil movie producer working the chipmunks to death . Something happened anyway and it was n't for the better . Of course the movie is trying to tell the story of how the chipmunks Simon and Theodore began . Everyone knows the Christmas song . Here we discover how they met Dave and got their start . The movie is updated to the present time although their real origin is noted by Dave's street address of which was the year when the animated singing rodents were first created . Jason Lee did a pretty good job as Dave and the chipmunk voices were also pretty good . David Cross as the evil Ian irritated me to be blunt and could n't figure out the point of the character of Claire played by Cameron Richardson . She added little to the movie . It's a movie you can watch with the kids it's probably a movie you'd only want to watch with the kids in fact . It gets a from me .
10942_1.txt,0, Shakalaka Boom Boom is a rip off from the movie Amadeus . personally rate Amadeus as one of my favorites not only because it is about music which is my favorite subject but also because it tells us the real story of a musical genius who is not only remembered for the voluminous works of beautiful music he produced during his life but for his own self nature and his tragic death at a young age of being virtually uncelebrated during his life time because of the politics played by some people particularly Saliere the Italian composer who was jealous of him . Personally was shocked to see Shakalaka . as the director has invariably cut most of the scenes from the movie Amadeus . see the worst kind of plagiarism in this movie and am skeptic about the kind of movies Bollywood keeps on churning day by day . The movie is a disaster the two musicians in the movie do n't give you any feeling of being realistic the film is tasteless meaningless and total failure on every count . The only person who makes an impact is Bobby Deol who at least knows how to act . Otherwise the whole cast looks like a bunch of amateurs . The irony is that while watching the movie the first screen in the movie says that all characters in this movie are fictitious and that any resemblance with anyone is purely coincidental which is a blatant lie because all resemblances are very much clear and they are very much intended . wish could take Darshan and Co. to court not only for Copyright Infringement but also for mutilating a beautiful work of art .
9220_4.txt,0, POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER It's not a terribly objective review but just found this movie horribly depressing . Like a lot of Russell Davies work it asks more questions than it can answer . His best work Rose Doctor Who revels in hope against the odds and perseverance even after apparent defeat . These uplifting themes seemed strangely absent here . suppose the fact that I'm still thinking about it days after viewing is a testament to the quality of the program but the resolution was just too bleak for my tastes . would however disagree with the reviews I've read complaining that the end feels tacked on . think each conclusion follows logically from its premise and the ending represented a sound personal belief that neatly resolved the primary theme of the show . While never really questioned the progression of events felt like there was much that could have been expanded upon . I've also read that it was originally conceived as a four part series instead of two and it's possible that the truncation has done some harm to the completed piece . However these flaws appear throughout in sequences and themes that sometimes feel rough or sketched in . To his credit Davies is totally unafraid to write big and you have to admire the sheer audacity and scope of this project . The premise he tackles here is the stuff of movies or novels it is a brave and ambitious thing to tackle it in the medium of television . Strong points include Christopher Eccleston who is positively mesmeric in the lead . For me he was and remains the best reason to watch . The depiction of the Messiah's humanity was brilliant thought provoking and engaging and a real credit to both Davies writing and Eccleston's acting . also thought the depiction of the modern world's reaction to the second coming rang true . So two stars simply because personally want my entertainment to be entertaining . would rather be uplifted or at least distracted by my fiction . have a whole big real world around me as filtered through CNN or the newspapers if choose to be horribly depressed . There are definitely less subjective reasons by which to judge this piece but I'm afraid my judgment in this matter is clouded by my emotional response .
6418_4.txt,0, This quirky and watchable film is the story of a deluded dentist who starts out on his mission or crusade to fight tooth decay in the back and beyonds of Patagonia . Hailing from Northern Ireland via New Jersey the main character Fergus sees his crusade as a mission of mass importance and approaches it with all the enthusiasm vitality discipline and attention to detail one would expect from a trained dentist . Which adds to the hilarity as his grand plans unravel and gradually fall to pieces as he goes from disaster to debacle in the Patagonian outback on the back of a customised motor bike or his er mobile dental unit . We never get to meet his wife nor the rich philanthropist who is sponsoring the ill mission but we do get a solid display from Lewis . Fans of his work will not be disappointed with his very believable performance as the deluded dentist who is gallantly adored by the innocent but sexy year old female lead who tags along on for the ride . This film is not for everyone and can understand why it was n't pushed by the suits . It's a low budget sometimes charming always disarming mildly amusing and instantly forgettable film that sets out with low expectations and almost succeeds .
2553_4.txt,0, must say was disappointed with this film . Although it is well acted and directed the underlying story simply plods along too slowly . Granted in another mood would have liked it better . did chuckle a lot but rarely laughed out loud and there was actually a sense of suspense to discover who won . But in contrast to another movie that my wife picked up the same day neither of us had heard of before this one paled in comparison . If you see lots of movies then by all means see this it's distinctly better than your average fare . But if you me have limited time and want to watch only the best and most entertaining save this for later .
1976_4.txt,0, So after the initial disappointment of the first Final Fantasy movie which seemed to bare next to no resemblance to the Final Fantasy series Final Fantasy Advent Children has released itself to a warm reception and now a dedicated fanbase . And the reason for the films success is understandable as it has lush graphics fast moving fight sequences and some cool as hell characters . However if you have n't played FF then it is likely that you will not enjoy this film as it's storyline carries on from the game without previous explanation and your likely to get lost from the plot even if you have played the game . Secondly there is no character development without previous knowledge from the game your opinions on the characters are limited to and cool Of course for FF fans the film is almost guaranteed to entertain at least for nostalgic reasons and it's cool seeing all the characters you grew to love from the game rendered in some pretty amazing computer animation . One last complaint the film at least in my opinion attempted to cram too much into less than two hours and therefore the last half hour or so seems horribly rushed . If you played and enjoyed FF than it is a worthwhile watch though nothing too special . If you have not played FF then it is best that you play it first before watching this film .
6077_2.txt,0, find myself alarmed that people are not so critical of a work that deserves criticism . The many similarities both structurally and literally with aside the Beethoven deliberately chooses the easy path by putting audience before art . And therefore denying the world a discerning intelligent and creative work . Now consider the following Is it not possible that the real story of the creation of the ninth symphony may actually be an engaging and powerful story itself and equally so in a dramatic telling ? Beethoven was completely deaf by the writing of the symphony is n't that more interesting ? How WAS the symphony conducted ? Would n't it be great to know ? So ask yourself what possible motivation could a filmmaker have for introducing a woman as the copyist ? If there was a copyist he would certainly be a man . What was his story ? try to be a little critical here even if you like the invention of a woman composer Fantasy should be much MORE than a distortion of reality to serve a writers purpose . For those who find themselves comparing and justifying the invention of Anna Holtz with the invention of Salieri's claim to have murdered Mozart in consider that he confessing to a priest in a lunatic asylum uses this device to great affect in the film Beethoven may have worked if Anna was a figment of Ludwig's fevered imagination . But we are meant to believe she is Yes and that Strauss was assisted by aliens . Most of the positive reviews I've read here so far are often expressions of a DESIRE for the film to be good almost a deliberate amnesia . Remembering the film for what you wish it to be rather than what it is . For those who believe that fantasy justifies the means then consider you are not only accepting an inferior interpretation of real events but also sacrificing the truth for the sake of a triviality . Finally a short note on the acting here that may surprise some of you . Ed Harris is NOT good as Ludwig Van Beethoven . Does that shock you ? He looks awkward throughout the film much like an actor dressed up but off set and standing at the catering table . Most of his lines are said as cues rather than replies to Anna Holtz's lines he is not listening to the actor He is quite clearly an actor masquerading as the character rather than BEING the character . Really how many times does Beethoven have to roll in his grave before we get it right ? Just ask yourself would Ludwig approve ?
10285_1.txt,0, There is a growing trend in the media to vilify and ridicule men . One sees it in television adverts and program plots . Cheaters is a prime example they could find plenty of female cheaters yet the vast majority shown are men why ? The prime threat to any government's power resides in the male population they're less likely to abide by authority and are more of a physical combat threat . way to reduce the threat is to emasculate men in society via the media . Other examples of psychological propaganda are crime dramas full of self righteous cops including big aggressive women accusing everyone they question trampling their rights and making those men feel like scum . In Australia many top male sports stars have been arrested recently for dubious assaults and drinking charges another example of the government controlling the male populous by arresting their heroes and asserting dominance . Cheaters aside from the political machinations is an invasion of privacy and a violation of rights furthermore most of these women assault the men ! If it were round the other way the men would be in jail ! If it were an honest show they would be finding women cheaters because they do n't normally get caught due to the fact that their male lovers are quite happy to get in no strings attached and get out without rocking the boat . Men's mistresses want the men to themselves and want to own and control the men and thus get the men caught anyway .
3901_4.txt,0, Do n't be fooled by the other reviewers . Although this film contains an impressive array of talent the material they present leaves a great deal to be desired . Nat King Cole's numbers are pretty lame and not even close to his later efforts though he does impress with his piano playing . Mabley is not a bit funny though remember her as a very entertaining talk show guest from my youth . Actually the best performances are from a couple of fat guys who impress with a lively tap dance and a Four Tops takeoff and the jazz band itself especially in the number featuring the bass player . The print itself is pretty poor quality and the wonderful Butterfly McQueen is totally wasted in the wraparound plot .
5885_4.txt,0, This is an extremely competent movie technically . The camera work and direction are excellent and the acting is fine as well the fine acting by Daniel Auteuil as the Marquis . really thought there were no problems at all with these aspects of the film . Instead was a bit annoyed by the way the Marquis was portrayed as it did n't seem all that honest and seems to be a very revisionistic view of history . In fact in recent years the Marquis has undergone a bit of a transformation to a defender of freedom with great insight not the fat sado rapist he really was . In a way this is highly reminiscent of the whitewash given in THE PEOPLE VERSUS LARRY FLINT these men are elevated to hero status . Even if you do n't think that the Marquis perversions were n't all that bad included rapes and extreme violence his portrayal in this film as a sexual social worker'' in this prison seems pretty silly . Instead of the violent and selfish Sade he spends a lot of time carefully grooming a young virgin and slowly helps her to explore her own sensuality . What a nice and kind man . In fact now that think about it this performance reminds me of the man Maurice Chavalier played in GIGI without the singing cute older man who loves the ladies . strongly doubt the real Marquis de Sade would have recognized this character at all ! The film surprisingly does n't have a lot of nudity though what it does show is extremely explicit . Only a maniac would let their kids see this as this is a very adult drama . It's very well and pretty entertaining not all that truthful . The director admits that the film is largely fictional in the interview among the special features on the DVD watched . So go ahead and see the film if you'd like it just is n't very good historically . During the century sexual libertines were quite accepted in France as they were pretty broad so despite what the movie implies it was n't SEX that was the issue it was the violence and rape that was still is the problem .
10367_3.txt,0, This one and the one prior Toulon's Revenge'' and the next one seem to be completely different from the first two movies where the puppets were not so nice . It is basically choose your series the first two go together and paint the puppets as killers while the next three are a series of them being the good guys . This one plays out to much like some cheesy television series episode to be as good as part three was and never really had the urge to try and watch part five of the series . Basically a kid gets the puppets while some strange dark lord or something sends his evil puppets out to kill this dark lord looks like some sort of enemy from one of those live action Japanese shows like Ultraman . The movie is over before you know it though so it has to get credit for not inflicting you with a very painful to watch movie . Just to many plot holes and things in it for it to be considered an okay movie . You do get to see the guy who played Toulon in the last movie though then you have a very anti battle and wham the movie is over before it really begins .

His father Farrell is a vicar and his mother Linney is well let's just say she's a somewhat hypocritical soldier in Jesus army . It's only when he takes a summer job as an assistant to a foul eccentric once and now actress Evie Walton Walters that he finally finds himself in true and Maude fashion . Of course Evie is deeply unhappy herself and it's only when these two sad sacks find each other that they can put their mutual misery aside and hit the road to happiness . Of course it's corny and sentimental and very predictable but it has a hard side to it too and Walters who could sleep her way through this sort of thing if she wanted is excellent . It's when she puts the craziness to one side and finds the pathos in the character hitting the bottle and throwing up in the sink that she's at her best . The problem is she's the only interesting character in the film it's not because of the script which does n't do anybody any favours Grint on the other hand is n't just unhappy he's a bit of a bore as well while Linney's starched bitch is completely one she's got the English accent off pat The best that can be said for it is that it's mildly enjoyable with the emphasis on the mildly .
8733_3.txt,0, After his career as a romantic leading man ended in the late Rock Hudson starred in lots of different projects including TV shows and lesser films . However believe that Embryo'' is his only turn as a mad scientist and that's probably a good thing . guess he needed the work . Driving along one dark and stormy night brilliant Dr. Paul Holliston hits and injures a Doberman which he brings back to his lab looks somewhat like a dank Midwestern basement He then manages to raise the dog's unborn puppy outside the womb so naturally he decides to do the same thing with a human being . He raises Victoria beautiful Barbara Carrera from a fetus the same way . Victoria grows at an astonishing pace and soon blossoms into a gorgeous young woman . Predictably things go very wrong . After a halcyon beginning Holliston's sister Martha Ladd begins to wonder where the young woman came from and Victoria herself begins to show signs of instability and violence . The final sequence is one long car chase straight out of Smokey and the Bandit'' after which Victoria has shockingly aged in just a few minutes assaulted by a frantic Holliston who tries in vain to destroy his malformed creation along with its unborn child . All of this is accompanied by screeching tires roaring engines a car fire and lots of sirens . The limp ending bunch of paramedics frantically working on Victoria while Holliston writhes in regret more labored than creepy . Although just made in this movie is very dated . The only difference between this and the many mad scientist movies is that Hudson plays the lead role rather than Boris Karloff . The sets are pretty cheap and very antiquated to today's audiences to the extent that Hudson's reel tape recorder is about the size of a refrigerator . Much of the action takes place in a poorly lighted laboratory . Hudson sleepwalks through his sordid role giving the impression that he's truly a washed movie star while Ladd and Carrera are much more believable . Surprisingly Roddy McDowall pops up briefly as a chess player . The Passport Video transfer is very substandard looking as though it had been made from a poor VHS copy using home equipment . If you're nostalgic for watch this once just to say you did . Otherwise watch a football game or soap opera instead .
2772_4.txt,0, What liked best about this flick was the chance to see Joan Woodbury who awe me as one of the several beauties in the Charles Boyer classic Algiers'' in a leading role . She does well as Rita an orphan who rises to make good as a lady crime boss . Her ascent to the top reminds me of Joan Crawford's characters Mildred Pierce who realize their ambitions by fierce determination and willpower . If you're looking for a film noir classic better look elsewhere . At several points it's difficult to know where this story is going . first got the impression that it was going to encompass Rita's plot for revenge against the father and son who tricked her into taking the rap for a drunk driving death perpetrated by the playboy son . But payback time ended up being only a minor point and a springboard to the somewhat confusing second part of the film where Rita becomes increasingly involved in city corruption . Anyway it's only minutes so a second viewing should clear up any haziness . My copy is from a Platinum box set called Mobster Movies'' The picture quality is good but the soundtrack sucks constantly skipping fragments of dialog . There are eight films in the box making each movie a fair cents . Look for Anne Archer's father John Archer as Rita's childhood friend Bob . Alan Ladd does n't get much screen time . It's definitely Joan Woodbury's picture .

Shipwrecked doctor Claudio Cassinelli and crew land on the island they're either picked off by the fishmen or roped into working for treasure hunting lunatic Richard Johnson . Cassinelli discovers that Johnson who believes he's found the lost city of Atlantis has been keeping disgraced scientist Joseph Cotten and his daughter Barbara Bach hostage for years so the fishmen can uncover a treasure trove beneath the sea . Cotten of course is a complete madman . Bach and Cassinelli have great chemistry . This insanity was directed by Sergio Martino and is not surprisingly without merit . It's fast paced reasonably well acted and the fishmen look pretty convincing it's unlikely anyone could prove that these things DO N'T look like actual fishmen There's an excellent music score by Luciano Michelini .
6317_3.txt,0, Not being a particular fan of westerns watched this primarily because wanted to see Lucille Ball in something other than an Love Lucy'' or Lucy Show'' type of role . Here she plays Christine Larson owner of a saloon in the Arizona Territory in who's about to be married to the unscrupulous local Indian agent Jagger . Ball's performance was OK nothing really more than that she did n't blow me away . It succeeded for me in that the role was very different from what I'm accustomed to seeing her in there was very little of the outrageous physical comedy she later became famous for although the movie tried to maintain a gently amusing feel throughout . typical funny line there's two ways to deal with women and no one knows either one of them ! did n't find the story all that compelling although appreciated that the Indians were shown as the victims of the Indian agent . There's typical shootout action and a lot of horses your typical western in other words . As to Christine we pretty much can guess from the beginning how her planned marriage is going to end up it's just a question of how she's going to get there . If you like westerns this would be a pretty typical one with a bit of humour thrown in . If you're not big on the genre this will be lacking . I'm not big on the genre .

This is of course Milligan's take on the Sweeney Todd tale done with period costumes not necessarily period hairstyles in some cases and the usual headache camera grainy quality . As for the gore well the version saw may have been cut some for there's not a lot for a film with bloodthirsty'' in the title . The best indication of subversive film here is a meat pie consisting only of some poor victim's tit . So while will still treasure this piece of uh work on my video shelf it's definitely somewhat of a letdown as far as content though . Recommended for only the foolhardy morbidly curious . out of

This is mind you almost ten years after the initial release of DKC The graphics were ground for their time the first vector graphics games for home systems . The music and characters are all memorable and the games brought myself and my girlfriend dozens of hours of entertainment .

459_4.txt,0, Less than two hundred and fifty years ago the last of the great pirates wrote their names in blood and fire across the pages of maritime history . This is the story of a buccaneer Captain whose name for one short year struck terror in the hearts of seafarers and merchants from the ports of the Caribbean to the trading houses of London . Hmm that opening to the film sounds like we are in for one hell of a swashbuckling pillaging ripper of a movie does n't it ? Well it's not . Tho it's not totally without value as a curio piece . Out of Century Fox Anne Of The Indies is adapted by Philip Dunne Arthur Caesar from a short story written by Herbert Ravenel Sass . Direction is by Jacques Tourneur the score is by Franz Waxman and Harry Jackson is providing the Technicolor photography . Jean Peters is in the titular title role of Anne Captain Providence and support comes from Louis Jourdan Debra Paget Herbert Marshall Thomas Gomez James Robertson Justice . Originally meant to be be based on true life pirate Anne Bonny the film ultimately turns out to be a tale of a woman seeking identity and finding herself in the predominantly male led world of piracy and sea based shenanigans . Filled with clich and over familiar set pieces the film also suffers from a cast that is largely misfiring . Peters gives it a right good go and Paget lights up the screen with effervescent beauty . While Robertson Justice although underused actually looks the part and does n't overact like the rest of the male cast does . Some reviewers have desperately tried to dig deep into the film to find intelligence and hidden meanings purely because it's Tourneur in the directing chair . But there is no depth here this is merely a job for Tourneur a professional one granted but its thinly plotted and actually lacking swash to go with the buckle in the action stakes . Disposable at best .
5533_1.txt,0, Wakayama Tomisaburo's portrayal of fugitive ex Ogami Itto felt entirely natural . His demeanor his voice his appearance all of it spoke to dislodgement . When he entered a space as well as characters on the screen could feel he did n't belong there and that his determination to be there spelled trouble . read somewhere that Mr. Wakayama actually took Kendo swordsmanship training and that would explain his comfort with the katana which showed magnificently in every cutfest . If you watch the movies from the moment he draws to the moment he sheaths the sword you feel as though you were witnessing something inevitably ugly . He'd even spin the katana quickly to flick off the blood before sheathing it and it would happen in an effortless instant . Nakamura Kinnosuke's rendition comes across as a rendition . It feels as though he were trying too hard to be someone else or tell someone else's story . As a result every time tried to engage I'd lose my grip because HE did n't seem to have a firm grip on the role himself . As though it were awkward for him . The swordsmanship in the TV series was entirely old Hollyweird too . Camera cuts to disguise Mr. Nakamura's awkwardness with the katana slow action targets sitting still etc . Extremely bad from a viewer's perspective . There was a moment in the episode The Castle Wall Attack when Mr. Nakamura drew his sword like a child . It was embarrassing . He handled it as though it were heavy ! almost fell off my chair . And let's be frank The story is about an excellent swordsman . Period . Swordsmanship is an issue . Realism is n't however the swordplay in the movies was excellent and manga as was intended I'm sure . baby cart was outfitted with a cluster of automatic rapid muskets operated by a year old ? Yes . It's how the story seamlessly weaves historical cultural accuracy into basically superhero fantasy that makes the movies captivating . Yoshikawa Eiji's Musashi legend could n't really sit through the TV series episodes . They just felt cheap . See the movies first and you'll know what I'm talking about .

Even though it is rated and is clearly for kids there is quite a lot of swearing the dreaded and words This kind of language does n't offend me particularly but in a kids film ? Come on . There was also quite a bit of implied sexual content between one of the early adolescent male characters and any willing adult woman who came along including a prostitute ! The acting was as good as it gets in this genre of film but the story line was very very cheesy and even my four year old remarked that it was Despite having Elizabeth Shue this film is definitely not worth checking out if you have n't seen it .
6130_4.txt,0, Before going any further have to admit that only saw the first episode of this show . If had the time might have considered watching it every week if only to see how the season played out . However it was very clear to me from the beginning that Martha Stewart's version of The Apprentice'' just does n't fit in . Martha Stewart made a career of being a happy homemaker a domestic diva of the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Julia Child . It was only since her scandalous legal troubles and subsequent incarceration that her public image began to reflect the true roughness of her character . Sure she was compelling for a while and this entire series poses the interesting question of what it means to be a woman in business . Does she have to come off as cold and tough ? Should n't she ? But the truth was by the time Stewart came out of prison her attempts for a public comeback though certainly warranted were never going to seize viewers interest for very long . Perhaps a true comeback would have worked had she returned home peacefully and waited a year or so after her often mocked ankle bracelet was removed . Instead she frantically dove into overkill with series at once the other being her syndicated daytime series Martha much like her old show but more mainstream with famous guests like Bette Midler . Of course even at her peak Stewart was never mainstream so it's too much to ask that American audiences immediately accept her foray into reality TV . Maybe America wants Stewart to make a comeback on her own rather than be the basis for it . The show was basically a tired retread of Trump's Apprentice which still holds my interest depending on the tasks the cast and Trump's firing decisions controversial likely for that reason The letter bit was certainly not clich but obnoxious in the least . The fact that Stewart never says You're fired ! mentioned in the message board on this site is particularly distressing . Producer Mark Burnett should be admired for dealing with Stewart's jail time honestly while trying to make her a hero but the truth is that anyone watching can tell that she's basically trying to put on a show of being this nice businesswoman . Again never mainstream Stewart lacks the agreeability and identifiability of Oprah Winfrey and the admirable charismatic toughness'' of Donald Trump . Yes this can be a gender assessment of her character but mean it to be more about the nature of her business . It comes as no shock that Stewart has been fired but wonder if they really always intended it to only last for one season ?

We have few chances to see her though . think that's especially true in the United States . Here she plays a sympathetic role . Not only that but she is also very pretty and meant to be something of a bombshell . Walter Pigeon does not hold up the tradition of Drummond performers . He is always reliable but he's not much fun . He's not a rascal or a knave . Consequently this seemed to me a talky endeavor with little action or suspense . But check it out for Leighton .

As a story that is surreal this movie could've been great great as it is rated by some here but mixed with the acting and relatives playing major roles due to financial reasons reckon found in here although calling this acting is not only a stretch of that word it's giving it a new meaning ! whole new meaning ! If you are into surreal movies are some that do like actually see the Japanese Strange Circus for example you might be able to overlook the flaws above and enjoy this more . There are great ideas here after all ! Many great metaphors and ambiguous scenes but while watching this a group of friends almost all of us just could n't stop laughing not the intention of the director of course ! Again everyone has their own liking as one can see by the high rating of this movie but could only recommend the movie if you're aware of the work that Alejandro Jodorowsky has done and are a fan of his !

11025_4.txt,0, decided to watch this movie because I'd not seen Carol Lombard before in any movie . I'm sorry it had to be this one because quite frankly this is a dog and even with Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn both of whom were great actors . The problem with the film is simple it tries to put too much too quickly in to a story about a young lawyer Manson played by Stewart who marries Jane by Lombard within an hour of meeting her . What's that clich Marry in haste repent at leisure . In short the story is a series of episodes that show the couples worsening financial status their troubles with John's live mother their struggles to pay the bills John's diminished status at the office the arrival of their baby son John Jnr and causing additional friction at home with mother the couples angst about their marriage the baby's sickness which worsens thus necessitating an heroic flight by a lone pilot a fierce storm to bring a special serum to save the child and finally John being accepted as a junior partner at the law firm . How many more clich situations could the writers include ? Maybe Mother dying soon after ? There was n't much comedy the drama was lacklustre at best the dialog was painful to hear . Only the acting of the four main players was adequate . This was the period at the end of the Great Depression with the USA coming out of its long downturn during which many people experienced all of the events portrayed in the movie . So it made sense for Selznick to reaffirm good ol home spun American values of family relationships heroism perseverance and initiative all against the backdrop of the average'' American family . Who better to use than Jimmy Stewart and Carol Lombard ? And it should be noted that the film was released in early so it was planned in soon after the USA began to get production going for the coming World War II . Hence this sort of film was a great booster for the general public at that time many of who would soon have to join England in war . As many here would know Hollywood and Washington formed an uneasy alliance before during and after the war . However I'm glad saw it as a piece of disguised socio propaganda . But I'll have to see other Lombard films to gain a better appreciation of her acting range . As another reviewer noted see this one just to say that you've seen all of Stewart's movies otherwise do n't bother .
7698_4.txt,0, These days Ridley Scott is one of the top directors and producers and can command huge sums to helm movies since he has films like ALIEN GLADIATOR and BLADE RUNNER to his credit . So from this partial list of his credits it's obvious he's an amazing talent . However if you watch this very early effort that he made while in film school you'd probably have a hard time telling that he was destined for greatness . That's because although it has some nice camera and style the film is hopelessly dull and uninvolving . However considering that it was n't meant for general release and it was only a training ground then am disposed to looking at it charitably the score of By the way this film is part of the CINEMA European Shorts DVD . On this DVD are shorts . Most are n't great though because it contains THE MAN WITHOUT HEAD COPY SHOP RABBIT and WASP it's an amazing DVD for lovers of short films and well worth buying .

The Mask helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of comedy and reached a very popular status for its originality and just pure fun . Everyone knew how to spell party . Why ? Cuz got ta ! Now eleven years later it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie Son of the Mask . Someone asked director Lawrence Guterman why are you making this ? And he responds Cuz got ta ! Unfortunately that answer does n't cover it because after seeing Son of the Mask still left the theatre thinking Good Lord Why ? Guterman and the rest of the people involved in the blasphemous film need to realize that the response given to why are you making this film should not be as simple as the answer to the debate on whether or not to party . The Son of the Mask begins with Otis the dog finding the infamous mask and bringing it back to his owner Tim Avery a clear homage to legendary Loony Toons creator Tex Avery . Tim played by Jamie Kennedy is a struggling animator who is stuck working as a turtle tour guide for the animation company he aspires to one draw for . On the night of the company Halloween party Tim puts on the mask and transforms into the mischievous insane character that we all expect . After the party Tim goes home mask still on and conceives a child with his wife . Nine months later mayhem ensues as the baby born of the mask has remarkable cartoonish powers . Otis the dog jealous of the baby's attention puts on the mask and partakes in Tom and Jerry type mayhem to out the baby . Meanwhile Loki played by Alan Cumming is in search for his mask at the orders of his father Odin . First off ill admit that do respect the fact that this film pays so much homage to the classic cartoons such as Tom and Jerry and Loony Toons with its Wile Coyote type contraptions and the infamous dancing frog type plot . However this reverence can not save the film and makes it less respectful and more of a waste of time . The premise of the movie becomes increasingly silly . Silly is not always a bad thing but in this movie the silliness gets to the point of just plain annoying . The characters are not fun to watch and what's worse they're not funny . The dullness of the characters can also be attributed to the fact that so much CGI was used . One of the greatest things about the original is that while obviously computer animation was used so much relied on Jim Carrey and his exuberant style of just being . Jim Carrey we were convinced was an actual cartoon . Jamie Kennedy just does n't have that kind of ability a fact that is clear when you watch him wear the mask and his facial features rarely shift . The baby and dog were mostly completely animated which became increasingly distracting throughout the movie . The side story of Loki searching for the mask just became more and more stupefying . The son of the Mask is a sad sad state of affairs . What suggest is you go rent or buy the original the Mask and thank the Norse gods or whoever for bringing it to us . And will consider seeing the sequel my sacrifice as continue to ask the infamous question WHY ? The son of the Mask gets one star although that star should be divvied up between the classic creators of Loony Toons and Jim Carrey who will always be in my book the mask .
8319_4.txt,0, The Brave One is about a New York radio show host named Erica Bain Foster Her life is a dream living in the city she grew up in and loves . She has her great fianc David Andrews whom she is planning to marry . But one night while Erica and David are out walking their dog they are attacked and mugged by a group of degenerates leaving David dead . Erica recovers but is heartbroken and traumatized later on and can barely cope with real life anymore . She buys a gun off a guy on the streets for protection . But one day she's shopping in a store and a man comes in and shoots the clerk dead . It is then that Erica shoots and kills this man and she becomes a vigilante . Killing anyone who tries to threaten or harm her or any others . At the same time Detective Mercer Howard is tracking down this elusive unknown killer and in the process becomes friends with Erica . Erica begins to regain her sanity as she kills these violent people but is unsure of whether or not what she's doing is morally right . And as her and Mercer become closer he does n't even realize the unknown murderous assailant is right next to him . Jodie Foster gives a very good performance in The Brave One . She portrays this type of violent morally corrupted character brilliantly . Terrence Howard is also great in this movie . Both have excellent chemistry together and strengthen the film to a certain level . The Brave One looks visually pristine and conveys some brilliant camera work but not all of it works to a great effect . The scenes where Erica is absolutely traumatized and afraid to walk out her front door to face the world . The camera swayed back and forth to the sides in an almost dream way and really captured the moment with essence . Whereas almost every time Erica killed somebody everything just had to go slo and show her facial expressions in fine detail . The slo was properly used when Erica committed her first murder . But why keep doing this effect almost every time she committed murder ? The camera work creates a great atmosphere in most of the film but there a few scenes here that are just plain overkill . The Brave One is very much about how these murders affect Erica emotionally . Her fianc is killed by a group of thugs and suddenly her love of New York City is turned upside down . She realizes that there is a dark side to the beloved city and she says so on her radio show . do n't completely understand this though . Erica acts as if she never realized that violence can occur at night in the city and that's pretty stupid . If she lived there all her life she must be either blind or very oblivious . Erica also seems to be a glutton for inhumane murderous people . She really does n't even have to go look for them they just to come to her as if they're begging to be shot dead for their wrong The Brave One deals with the morals and proper use of violence strongly at first and then suddenly it glorifies it . The ending is very negative and completely immoral and inhumane . It also negates the purpose of Terrence Howard's character which the movie spends so much time trying to evenly develop and suddenly his morals take a The morals in The Brave One become very fractured and just plain shatter all over the place by the end . So violence is okay ? It's a good thing to commit murder as long as it's for vengeance ? pretty much refuse to believe that . You know why ? Because have a conscience which this film surely lacks . It is not right to take the life of another person no matter how bad they are or how much you hate them . Erica Bain sets out to stop these evil but in the end she is no better than the horrible people she kills . Jodie Foster and Terrence Howard provide a lot of strength for this movie . The Brave One contains a strong message but that message is both immoral and wrong . This movie may look pretty well acted and intelligently strong . But it becomes pretty rotten by the end . give The Brave One a out of The message is very out of line and morally incorrect and really ca n't be saved by the good acting .
1872_4.txt,0, Just caught The Rain People'' on Turner Classic Movies late one night . The film was released in Shirley Knight stars as Natalie a Long Island housewife who exact reasons unknown leaves her husband and embarks on a road trip not knowing exactly where she is going . Natalie is also newly pregnant which complicates things . Along the way she picks up a brain ex player Jimmy'' Caan who has been kicked out of his college and is hitchhiking . There are many twists and turns along the way between these two as Natalie struggles to take care of Jimmy and she begins to realize he is mentally limited and can not take care of himself . She is going through her own struggles needless to say and in no position to care for him . Natalie appears to be a woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown at times she makes some odd phone calls to her husband who begs her to come home . Natalie tries to dump Jimmy several times only to have him re her life through circumstances . young Robert Duvall plays a strange and troubled cop who befriends Natalie . You get the sense all along that this film is going to end badly and it does . This film is certainly uneven at times and the script is somewhat lacking . Francis Ford Coppola directed this and of course he would soon become immensely famous in the next few years for directing The Godfather . The actors are good ones needless to say as they all would have futures ahead of them in film . Shirley Knight is the least known of the three although she is also underrated as an actor . James Caan is especially effective here and he seems to just inhabit this character . This film remains little more than a curiosity now no doubt because it is an early movie of Coppola's and confess had never heard of it . So God bless Turner Classic Movies for bringing it to a new audience .
566_3.txt,0, loved the first minutes and loved some of the dialogue in the tribunal proved to be the best showcase for the director's ahead method acting technique this movie ultimately disappoints . Even when viewed purely as a metaphor of the oppressor dynamics that were and are prevalent in the relationship between the US government and its more disobedient'' citizens it still lacks punch and believability and ultimately left me looking at my watch hoping the obvious ending would happen already . And for the record despite rampant rumors to the contrary this movie has never been banned in the US ca n't comment on the rumors of UK censorship but I'm suspicious Hollywood refused to distribute it after its initial film festival showing and am more than willing to believe the Nixon government had some influence on this decision however the fact that it never appeared on American television is merely a reflection of this medium's rather careful and advertising fashion of doing business . As for the present you can have your very own copy of the DVD delivered to your door via Amazon in a few days .

What remember most vividly is that the more sophisticated audience members consisting of children between and howled with laughter at the tree monster . triple bill at a theater showing adventure films is something an year old does not forget but ca n't remember the names of the other films . did star George Montgomery and David Farrar . UPDATE The other films in this triple bill were much better . They were Watusi with George Montgomery and David Farrar starring and The Angry Red Planet with Gerald Mohr and Naura Hayden staring . Ms. Hayden has written a couple of books on health and fitness also .
1682_2.txt,0, give the show a six because of the fact that the show was in fact a platform for Damon Wayans as the Cosby Show was for Bill Cosby it dealt with a lot of issues with humor and felt that it in fact tailored to getting a laugh as opposed to letting the jokes come from the character . Michael Kyle An interesting patriarch and a wisecracking person . He is PHENOMENAL in movies but in the show he was there for the wisecrack and though loved it felt that the laugh was more important than plausibility . Jay Kyle have loved her since House Party and have enjoyed her in School Daze and Martin this was a great role for her and she made a great choice in picking this sitcom to co in . also feel that Jay and Michael were more like equals in the show but Jay was more the woman who fed her crazy husbands the lines and went along with his way of unorthodox discipline because she may have felt that it worked Jr Just plain stupid his character should have been well developed and even though he does have his moments of greatness we are returned to the stupidity as if he learned nothing which drives me nuts ! Not to mention that most of the situations episodes I've seen seems to center around him Clair The attractive sister who dated a Christian found her boyfriend's character to be more interesting than she was be better off sticking to movies the writers should have done more to show her intelligence but it's not stereotypical enough Kady Lovable and the youngest daughter . think the writers established her character most on the show aside from the parents and Franklin Franklin LOVE this character and think they derived it from Smart Guy Mowry which only lasted one season . They did a great job of casting for this little genius effort would have been made if Jr would have been the smart one but show the down sides also All in all this sitcom is a wonderful thing and it's homage to the Cosby Show is well done love the show and wished it would have stayed on longer than that . ca n't wait to see the series finale
4839_1.txt,0, Dead Man's Bounty film's American title has the look and feel of a classic Italian western . The cinematography costumes and sets look great . The cast is rugged not a pretty face among them . At the beginning was preparing for a pretty cool movie but what eventually witnessed was an absolute disaster . The script was perfectly dreadful . There was no suspense whatsoever and very little action or worthwhile drama . Despite looking great the cast spoke with heavy European accents that were often unintelligible . The final nail in it's coffin was the broad streak of pretentiousness that paints most of the picture focusing heavily on the character of the barmaid who's featured in a couple of very awkward sex scenes . Also her speech near the end was pretty repugnant ! The only novelty comes from the stunt casting of Val Kilmer in the role of the dead man continuing his recent string of DOA performances !

Jefferson is more than the hero of a mythical America . He is silhouette of a vision about life and society an extraordinary thinker teacher of large part of North America . In film is only Superman . The delicate contour of ideas are crushed . The subtle birth of essential truth is forgotten . And Jefferson is basic instrument for create a good image of American realities . The end and fake romance and heroic is gun suicide of a story who may be tall with more wisdom . And the war against Avatar'' is another gray stain . For one who heard nothing about Jefferson movie is a good beginning . For the others disillusion . It is like the precious silk of a tailor .

Our very first horror movie !

Most sure it was that . for me this is a great movie !

Another flower whose bloom has come and gone un in the summer breeze . Amen . There is nothing more to say . And nothing more to add . sad epitaph to a once blossoming career as stated above .

With enormous success behind him in the misfit school vein he managed to branch out into other areas of comedy finding in the bargain a great ally in comedian John Candy . Here goof adult Candy becomes a better person after agreeing to babysit his brother's wiseacre kids it's a surefire formula designed to please both cynical teens as well as their parents and it is n't any wonder the film was a winner with theater audiences . Still Hughes relies almost completely on Candy's charm to put the scenario over and one may eventually grow tired of the repetitious gags with the star front and center . The kids are sitcom the other adults shapeless blobs and Amy Madigan is too intense too hyped playing Uncle Buck's girlfriend . Later became a TV series which is befitting since the material was already television from

Neither sequel capturing the charm and inoffensive appeal of The Love Bug back in in this one we find race driver Jim Douglas and his sidekick Wheely Applegate entering Herbie in the Monte Carlo Rally . Naturally things outside of the race start to take over priorities they get mixed up in a diamond robbery and Herbie falls in love with another car ! The car stunts are of course pleasant and easy on the eye and it would be churlish of me to really vent venom on such a friendly piece of fluff it's just that the film goes nowhere fast and personally now can see it for the coin motivated piece of work it is . Still you get to see Herbie take a bath foil the baddies and of course dance for the lady in his life so something there for everyone think .
1523_4.txt,0, The first time had heard of Guest House Paridiso was in the er . washroom'' after having just seen Fight Club . In each urinal was deposited a small round black circle . When the circle came into contact with moisture put it delicately it caused a colour picture to form with photographs of the two stars and the tag line You'll Yourself Laughing'' When you'd finished washing your hands the circle had dried and faded to black again waiting to spring it's surprise on the next victim'' Okay maybe the punchline was n't terribly sophisticated but you have to admit it was innovative . In fact think can honestly say I've never seen anything like it in my life before and these days of over a century of cinema and marketing that's a real feat . What a pity the film that went with it failed to live up to the promise . hate to pan Guest House Paridiso and am indebted to Rik Mayall Twat and Adrian Edmondson Elizabeth Ndingombaba for many years of laughter through their appealing television series be it the invention of The Young Ones the sitting room plays of Bottom or even solo work such as Rik in the New Statesman In fact this would have made an hilarious minute tv special . Unfortunately its an minute film . There's definitely some merit to be had and laughed continuously throughout the protracted finale which spoofed the Exorcist and Raiders of the Lost Ark and involved . well you'll have to see that bit for yourself . Yet often the pace is leaden and a sterile atmosphere is throughout . The two stars taking his usual backseat this time due to the fact that he adequately directs never really get into first gear Mayall only sporadically showing the foul mania that makes us love him on the small screen . Indeed the writers presumption that we are already familiar with the characters leads to them being underdelivered to the audience . The slight hints of depth seen in the series effeminate failed social for example are not present here and instead we are left with parodies of parodies . The Fawlty Towers accusation does pass water complete with drunken chef and unseen called waiter Pasquele'' which uncannily rhymes with Manuel . Some of the ideas such a hotel next to a nuclear reactor with a childrens swing hanging over a cliff face are very very funny but ultimately the frenetic pace is stolen the two constantly looking for a studio audience that is n't there and all the dead laugh'' areas patched up with incidental comedy'' music that would have been dated in a Carry On film two decades ago . Paridiso's brand of puerile sadistic perverse humour IS funny and feel sure it will make you laugh just not as often as it should .

2264_1.txt,0, As an avid Gone With the Wind fan was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters . Luckily the film on its own was a wonderful piece . When the book Scarlett came out read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together . While the book lacks any true quality it remains a good story and as long as was able to separate it from the original was and still is enjoyable . However consider the six hours spent watching the Scarlett'' miniseries to be some of the worst hours of my life . Discrediting any of the original character traits so well in Margaret Mitchell's book this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape mistrust murder and misformed relationships that even the book Scarlett stayed away from . The casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well in both the original novel and film and even carried through in the second book and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character . In the novel Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her estranged husband Rhett Butler to Charleston under the guise of visiting extended family . After coming to an arrangement'' with Rhett she agrees to leave and proceeds to reconnect with her O'Hara relatives in Savannah . Eventually she accompanies her cousin Colum a passionate leader of the Fenian Brotherhood to Ireland to further explore her family's roots that go deep and is eventually named The O'Hara the head of the family . While her duties as The O'Hara keep her engaged in her town of Ballyhara Scarlett ventures out into the world of the English landowners and instantly becomes a sought guest at many of their parties . She having been scorned by Rhett time and time again eventually agrees to marry Luke the earl of Fenton until Rhett comes along in a clich night type of a rescue . The Scarlett'' miniseries fails even to do this justice . Raped by her fianc and scorned by her family the series shows Scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed . heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision .
5146_3.txt,0, During production this LWT series was titled To The Moon a title that everyone on set at the time thought was cheesy enough . Then word came through that it had been retitled for the Moon as if this the addition of this new word would evoke heavy metaphorical meanings involving the relationships and aspirations of the characters . This same heavy handed lack of subtlety and understanding is clear throughout the very fabric of the entire series and the same tired and boring love storyline is actually stretched out over episodes ! Any television program that decides to use the storyline for even a single episode is pushing it but to smear it over seven episodes is unforgivable . There are reasons to watch however with the scenery of the Isle of Wight certainly providing a beautiful setting and the seemingly effortless performance of Lynda Bellingham hitting all the right comedy marks . This however is not enough . number of performances are noticeable especially when placed against the static and emotionless wasteland which Jonathan Kerrigan refers to as his face . have already mentioned Lynda Bellingham in the role of mother thats as far as character development and back goes but was impressed by the actor Maurice Roeves is by far the most experienced actor in the cast having appeared in everything from classic movies such as Richard Attenborough's What a Lovely War and Eagle Has Landed and TV including Baywatch Holby City The Bill Eastenders Cheers Doctor Who in the Star Trek and even going to Hollywood with Sylvestor Stallone in Judge Dredd whose performance reminded me very much of actual teachers have met often incapable men whose lives are tinged with a very sad streak . It is refreshing to see that Roeves is still getting work having also appeared in the British film Acid House and even more recently alongside the wonderful Maria Bello and Sean Bean in Dark The standout reason to watch this series even though his appearances are very few . Another actor who tries his hardest to elevate the program is Ben Miles in the role of the sex man brother again what an original character ! As with Roeves the CV says it all . After elevating this Miles has since appeared in the Hollywood movie for Vendetta and the star studded film Affair of the Necklace alongside Brian Cox Adrien Brody Christopher Walken and Jonathan Pryce . Unfortunately the fairly capable actors have mentioned are resigned to relatively small roles in comparison to the dramatic driftwood that is Kerrigan and Saira Todd both of whom seem to have been in Casualty for too long and have n't yet learned to act . Even the tolerable Frances Grey is made to suffer in the presence of such theatrically fetal mannequins and unfortunately for her the lasting memory have of her from the set is of the AD asking for another take of a relatively complex shot because during the take she subconsciously her knickers out of her crack ! Familiar faces appear in each episode child actors from CBBC programs and dramas such as Point Children and other regulars from commercials such as Mr Ben's remember me for this'' Lynda Oxo lady Bellingham and others that do n't even want to remember . Each episode halfheartedly tries to with issues such as teenage pregnancy disruptive pupils and rocket building things that Grange Hill was doing better when my parents were young ! Overall this series was a disappointment and a wasted opportunity to craft a genuinely interesting and well developed drama series . Unfortunately for them they took the easy route both in the writing and the most part in the casting . would recommend both Road and Street fans of good drama the latter in particular which managed to achieve this . If you like the Isle of Wight do n't for the moon reach for the holiday brochure instead it probably contains more character development !
625_2.txt,0, When was years old and going through my Marx Brothers phase my father read in the TV Guide that they were showing the Marx Brothers film The Big Store'' late on Friday night and set the VCR to tape it for me . When woke up on Saturday due no doubt to a misprint in the TV guide my father and discovered The Story of Mankind'' had been recorded instead . The Big Store'' was probably one of the least funny of all the Marx Brothers movies and nevertheless it stands as one of the century's finest works of cinema when compared with The Story of Mankind . can almost justify TV Guide's error in that the Marx Brothers Groucho Chico and Harpo appear in both movies . Although in The Story of Mankind they are divided up into a series of unrelated scenes Groucho plays Peter Minuit Chico plays some guy talking to Christopher Columbus and Harpo plays Isaac Newton ? Harpo's scene lasts about half a minute Chico only has two or three lines Groucho's scene is at least funny but horribly racially insensitive by today's standards . The rest of the movie does n't bear mentioning . They trotted out some of the finest actors of the day and made them recite total garbage . What a disappointment . TV Guide sent you a nice letter I'm still waiting for an apology . For the record The Big Store'' has a wonderful bit of physical comedy with the Marx Brothers on roller skates and a couple of songs by Virginia O'Brien . was really looking forward to seeing it .

The screwball comedies'' were full of that stuff and so were a lot of the Fred Astaire films . Here Barbara Stanwyck plays a famous country'' magazine writer who has been lying to the public for years and feels she has to keep lying to keep her persona her job She even lies to a guy about getting married another topic that was always trivialized in classic films . She's a New York City woman who pretends she's a great cook and someone who knows how to handle babies etc . Obviously she knows nothing and the lies pile up so fast you lose track . guess all of that is supposed to be funny because lessons are learned in the end and true love prevails etc . etc . Please pass the barf bag . Most of this film is NOT funny . Stanwyck was far better in the film noir genre . As for Dennis Morgan well pass the bag again .
11262_4.txt,0, have read and enjoyed many of James Lee Burke's Robicheaux mysteries . When read The Electric Mist With The Confederate Dead was being filmed and Tommy Lee Jones was playing the lead was thrilled . After watching it last night ending up turning it off with about twenty minutes left not wanting to see any more people shot or beaten up . Do n't get me wrong do n't mind blood and gore love Untouchables and Godfather Trilogy Perhaps it was just that had previously seen and Just Happened before watching this . know that Burke's books are violent lyrical and especially in the case of The Electric Mist can be like the Cajun swamps he writes about full of things that are never fully explained . In a book that's fine . In a film that's confusing . Many of the previous reviewers are also ardent admirers of Dave Robicheaux which makes it more understandable that they really liked the movie . Or they are admirers of Bernard Tavernier or both . Even as a fan of all the actors especially Vince felt it was such a waste of their talents overall gave good performances in a film that did n't hold together . Now say this having only seen the USA DVD and hoping that Tavernier's cut will make a huge difference . On the plus side The soundtrack was wonderful . The scenes at Robicheaux's place were perfect as imagined the bait shop to look like . Mary Steenburgen was excellent as Bootsie as was Walter Breaux as Batist . If you read the books you know why Robicheaux is an even person in the beginning of the film and then starts whacking people with various instruments . Overall wish that they had filmed more of the Mist and the Confederate Dead and left out large portions of Robicheaux's methods of interrogation explaining Elrod's gifts and his bond to Dave as well as Dave's to the General . Then would n't be feeling today as did last night when turned it off What just happened ?

The movie premise the costumes the special effects the acting . It all was ahead of its time . It opened the door for movies such as Star Wars the Terminator the Matrix and movies . Now people look at it and they say Well this does not add up to this new special effects story . It did not have any computer graphics and such as the new movies do these days . It did have a story and a wonderful cast and a hell of a director ! The places it was filmed like the Dallas World Trade Center and the Zale Building the Ft. Worth Water Gardens were at that time the most modern and futuristic backdrops in which to film . The director Michael Anderson was very creative and he tried to show a perfect future that was flawed by human desires and frailty's . It was my first film experience the first of six films have been in . Just because it was filmed in Texas does not make it any less a wonderful piece of filmmaker's art . Watch it again and appreciate it more . This movie was the foundation that set the standard for many great films that we now enjoy . Well my hand is blinking . got to run . Santuary awaits .
9958_4.txt,0, Thankfully you do n't need a lot of book learnin'' to understand where this thing's going . Obviously a poverty row cash on Universal's big hit THE WOLF MAN was made just one year earlier this finds the always George Zucco in another of his patented mad doctor'' roles as brilliant vengeance scientist Lorenzo Cameron . Cameron who has set up shop deep in the swamp lands of what I'm presuming is the Louisiana bayou is plotting revenge against four of his former peers who both humiliated him and forced him to resign from his previous job . You see they scoffed at his claims of being able to mix man with beast to create an unstoppable army of wolfman creatures that would come in handy during war Thankfully Cameron has found the ideal test subject for his wolf blood injections a hulking child half named Petro Strange Petro is pretty clueless as to what's going on does n't ask too many question and lets the doc strap him down to a table and shoot him up with whatever happens to be in his syringe . This results in a time change of man turning into a werewolf . Cameron lets him out of the mansion using a secret passageway so you basically get a big guy was dressed in overalls with a bushy beard hairy paws and a set of over plastic teeth running around in the woods the majority of the time . After an eyewitness sees the beast and a little girl is killed the locals grab their rifles and organize a posse to hunt it down . Dr. Cameron who can control the beast with a whip and also has a handy antidote to reverse the effect also drags Petro along to the big city to try to track down the professors who had made a mockery of his original theories and destroyed his reputation in the process . Also hanging around the house is Cameron's daughter Lenora Nagel as well as Lenora's nosy reporter boyfriend Tom Downs whose first inclination is that they're dealing with an upright prehistoric creature Though a typically chintzy PRC flick in many ways with unimpressive sets cinematography and make as well as a fairly bland supporting cast it remains watchable thanks to the histrionics of star George Zucco . have no clue why Downs received top billing he shows up half in and really does n't have a whole lot to do nor is he all that impressive doing it . This is Zucco's show all the way and he's great ranting and raving talking to himself while fantasizing that he's talking to his peers not interested in your imbecilic mouthings ! and temporarily sliding in and out of sanity . Strange seems to have patterned his performance as the hilariously naive and slow semi country bumpkin around the entire oeuvre of Lon Chaney Jr. from his turn as Lenny in OF MICE AND MEN to his performance as the aforementioned WOLF MAN . In any case Strange and Zucco do a fairly good job playing off one another . My favorite part is when Zucco calls him his guinea pig'' in front of a colleague while Petro just sits there grinning and staring at a doorknob . Some of the foggy swamp scenes are pretty atmospheric too .

Several in the cast perform well but The Blue Man'' winds up tying itself up in a knot . Aka Eternal Evil'' its unsatisfying story tries to be far too clever for its own good .
3489_4.txt,0, The of this film contains a few holes you could drive a massive truck through but reckon that is n't always top priority in horror . Two elderly sisters in rural England keep their brother in the cellar since more than years . Now he escaped and started a killing spree focusing on militaries that are homed nearby . only did we thought was best for him they keep on repeating and strangely all the army officers love these women and do n't doubt their sincerity even though of their men died . do n't know whether to find the revelation near the end suspenseful or tedious ! In a way this film reminded me about and Old Lace In that black classic two half siblings mother their goofy younger brother as well yet they do the killing there . The old ladies in Beast in the Cellar are by no means less crazy though . The in this early film is very amateurish and cheap but there are a few neat attempts to build up the tension . Too many talk about the good ol days though and that rarely is something you seek in a horror film with such an appealing title . Flora Robson who may be recognized by classic film buffs plays one of the sisters . She gave image to the Queen of England is the legendary Errol Flynn swashbuckler film the Sea Hawk .

Where are the good animators the good songwriters the good directors the good . Okay know Walt himself and the famous nine old man'' ca n't come back . But is this a reason to crank out countless of those cheap sequels and slowly but surely destroying the ideals of Walt Disney ? never rent or bought a Disney of what movie however . Because had read much enough about its of quality . But Atlantis Milo's Return'' was aired today on TV in Germany and so watch it . It confirmed my doubts about sequels . It was absolutely boring . Flaw animation primitive color simple characters some unsuccessful tries to simulate the famous Multiplane with CGI mediocre music and a patchwork of different simple stories . It looks absolutely not like Disney ! Not like Disney know ! It looks like one of the countless cheap and simple animation like DragonballZ'' Beyblade'' etc . that aired every day on TV for children . My first reaction after showing this crap was to load Bambi'' in my DVD to see Disney's immortal magic depth spirit and charm again to see Disney on its climax again to see the awesome art of handmade animation again . Bambi'' was the first until today the only movie that give out of stars . But Atlantis Milo's Return'' No magic no depth no charm no spirit . It deserved only out of

2161_4.txt,0, In the early Step came as a tedious combination of the ultra Full House'' and the long loopy classic hit The Brady Bunch'' The differences between Step and the two aforementioned shows was of course better writing excellent comedic timing from almost all of it's actors and a great deal funnier situations that were n't quite as sugar as it's extremely popular predecessors . Admittedly though even with the big boosts in the show's basic dynamics and all it still was n't exactly spectacular nor was it really even that memorable in the long line of corny family programming ! It was just a much better time you might say in comparison to the cutesy migraine Full House'' which coincidentally ran neck with Step during that time period in terms of overall popularity . The show now in syndication obviously is certainly suitable family but be sure to not expect much beyond that when watching it .

Yes it's long and portentous yes we do have some wonderful clips from the films that most people interested on the subject have already seen . But what resounds the longest leaving the most lasting impression is the gossip . The last and loudest voice comes from a third rate German actor ranting and raving .

8981_4.txt,0, This owes a great deal to the plot of CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS . Although he is quite grown up it is partly the story of a wealthy lad who is shanghaied as a crew member aboard a cargo vessel and becomes a man in the process . Moran of the title is a boyish young woman also brought up on a vessel owned by her father . When the cargo burns she and crew members are evacuated to our lad's ship . However the captain has smuggling on his mind and his intentions are not honorable where Moran is concerned . The inevitable ensues our lad falls for the mannish Moran and she for him . In the end evil is subdued and the lovers are united . Some interesting dialogue points out that Moran belongs to no man no woman . nod to Sappho here Dorothy Dalton is appropriately sexless as Moran and not too attractive either . Valentino does well in a romantic action role . His sexy build and physique are shown off to advantage and the role is quite a masculine one . He is very appealing . This is no great film but it passes the time . What it really showcases is Valentino's beauty and sexiness .

The music is disconcerting century sized chapel orchestras and choirs producing century concert hall sound . The overall production quality reminded me of a junior high slide show .

It's a pity he misused it though for the aggrandizement of his wounded ego feeding on the adulation of unwary sheep who were at his beck and call and in awe of him can inspire such extreme adherence and credulity . This movie presents an idealized version of Gurdjieff's own largely fictional and fantastic account of his formation and awakening'' would rather describe as his discovery of how much he could sway the minds and wills of certain types of sadly disoriented people See it if you dare to have a disagreeable eye about how sadly deprived we are of true religious leaders to the extent that a clown like Gurdjieff could inspire such devotion and be careful to have your blood pressure medicine at hand if you are one of those who still hope for a healthy religion to emerge from the ruins of Christianity as a supreme example of cinematography at the entire service of the premises and pretenses of a dysfunctional cult .
8549_3.txt,0, Despite having an absolutely horrid script about that later this film is still vaguely watchable just because it stars two excellent actors Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda . Aside from one or two REAL stinkers I'd probably watch just about anything with them in the film as am a huge fan of Hollywood's golden age of the and However no matter how much love their films just ca n't recommend this film . The movie begins with Fonda and Stanwyck on vacation at some ski resort . The two have n't yet met but the film begins loudly and obnoxiously with a scene in which Fonda horribly yodels while skiing . It was done so unsubtly and made my teeth grind but stuck it out when Fonda fell into a snow bank and this stopped the yodeling ! In hindsight perhaps should have just turned it off then ! Fonda is knocked out in the fall and Barbara goes for help . Back at the ski lodge he seems okay but fortunately she is ALSO a doctor and has him and nurses him back to health . He in turn becomes infatuated with her and proposes to her . Despite hardly knowing each other they marry and so far the film seems like a sweet but very slight romantic comedy . Once home however all is n't rosy as she jumps right back into her job as a family doctor and he begins exhibiting signs that he is a controlling and potentially dangerous man due to his jealousy . The film plays it all for laughs but frankly Fonda's behaviors were really creepy on her and her male patients attacking or threatening ANY man she treats tripping a patient who already has a back injury and stomping into a surprise party and insisting that everyone there and women are out to steal away his wife . He comes off as a combination of a sociopath and paranoid schizophrenic but it's all supposed to be for laughs . Considering that he seems like a dangerous nut you would think that Stanwyck would file for an annulment along with a restraining order ! But oddly she gets mad but just ca n't stay mad at Fonda because he's so . ca n't think of the right word is all that comes to mind ! Later out of the blue multi Fonda gets a job working the counter at a department store . Then through magical thinking he and Babs seem to assume his hostility and violent jealousy is all a thing of the past a job apparently cures anger and suspicions . When this job falls through the film ends with Fonda buying his own hospital giving Barbara a job there and they live happily ever after . They do n't go any further with the story but assume based on Fonda's character that he then spent most of his time as hospital administrator beating up all the male patients . The first portion at the ski lodge and the next did NOT fit well together nor did the final Horatio Alger'' inspired section where the rich boy made good in the business world . They were like three separate plots but despite this the most serious problem with the film was its seeming to excuse away domestic violence and delusional jealousy ! What a creepy little film ! Thank goodness neither Fonda nor Stanwyck are known for this yechy film but for all their other lovely films .
4219_1.txt,0, As an avid Gone With the Wind fan was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters . Luckily the film on its own was a wonderful piece . When the book Scarlett came out read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together . While the book lacks any true quality it remains a good story and as long as was able to separate it from the original was and still is enjoyable . However consider the six hours spent watching the Scarlett'' miniseries to be some of the worst hours of my life . Discrediting any of the original character traits so well in Margaret Mitchell's book this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape mistrust murder and misformed relationships that even the book Scarlett stayed away from . The casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well in both the original novel and film and even carried through in the second book and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character . In the novel Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her estranged husband Rhett Butler to Charleston under the guise of visiting extended family . After coming to an arrangement'' with Rhett she agrees to leave and proceeds to reconnect with her O'Hara relatives in Savannah . Eventually she accompanies her cousin Colum a passionate leader of the Fenian Brotherhood to Ireland to further explore her family's roots that go deep and is eventually named The O'Hara the head of the family . While her duties as The O'Hara keep her engaged in her town of Ballyhara Scarlett ventures out into the world of the English landowners and instantly becomes a sought guest at many of their parties . She having been scorned by Rhett time and time again eventually agrees to marry Luke the earl of Fenton until Rhett comes along in a clich night type of a rescue . The Scarlett'' miniseries fails even to do this justice . Raped by her fianc and scorned by her family the series shows Scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed . heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision .
3183_3.txt,0, Before took a job as a reviewer never went to films like this and thus remained blissfully unaware that at the soul of the Hollywood film lies a deeply woman spirit that thrives on putting its knocking little knees on the silver screen for all to either empathize with or revile . Or is this just a particularly bad year ? An ugly trend ? Here we have yet another seemingly sweet innocent beautiful woman turned lethal weapon . The kind that cautions us that beneath every pair of batting eyes and nesting instincts lies a wild beast guaranteed to make everyone's life within miles a living hell . This month's specimen is Jewel Valentine's Tyler whose simple dreams include having her own little house a backyard fountain and a mondo home entertainment system . Unfortunately Randy Dillon in his first film in years the dim bartender she picks up at McCool's one night intending to rob is less materially oriented . The kind of guy who drinks beer out of a toilet plunger he prefers to hunker down in his dead mother's house with few creature comforts save his snowglobe collection . In that same low bar the Devil in the Red Dress also bumps into Randy's cousin Carl highly amusing Paul Reiser a lawyer with an ego the size of St. Louis . When things go south within hours enter the widowed detective with a heart of gold Goodman The result ? Three men sustain big bad crushes on the leopard progeny of Steven Tyler and Bebe Buell that make them do things that common sense would normally contraindicate . Like get involved in the first place . Multiple points of view and flashbacks patch together the front news about how easy it is to fall victim to one's libido especially if you're male . As each of these men relates his perspective to a confidant his desire to possess The Jewel colors the of the situation . About minutes later things come together in a reasonably amusing way . But it's amusement from the same source that tells you that the stuff on the popcorn actually tastes like butter . MCCOOL'S is the first film by Norwegian commercial and music director Harald Zwart and his pedigree is clear during some of the fantasy segments including one about a car wash soap and a hose that you can probably extrapolate . It's also the debut project from the production company owned by Michael Douglas who's found his niche as a toupeed sleezeball in a bingo parlor . Dillon and Tyler are unlikely to win any gold statues for this one though given the one of their overdone film noir characters you ca n't really fault them . Several minor roles drag out unexpected guests McEntire plays Carl's psychiatrist and Andrew Dice Clay doubles as both the hoodlum Utah and his even brother . an outlet for all that aggression . This film unwittingly speaks volumes about the dynamics between men and women men and their mommies . But ultimately you'd probably find more lasting psychological truths in a Bugs Bunny episode . will say that it's better funnier more sophisticated than other recent gems like TOMCATS but should we really have to choose what to see based on what ranks lowest on the misogynism scale ?

His love scenes with Loretta Young in this romantic adventure thriller are passionate . Their kisses look very real . And very modern . Vivienne Osborne is a standout here also . She plays a woman with a reputation . But the character has a good heart . The print saw was not clear . But what a joy that rare movies like this are turning up !

9067_4.txt,0, Is there anything else on earth to be more enticing than to learn what expects our frail bodies after um death . Spanish director Ignacio Cerd soul of his German colleague Buttgereit provides blow answer to our curiosity and invites us to an exciting journey in the world of preparation tables scalpels surgical saws human entrails and warped minds . Welcome to the autopsy room ! do n't know which facets of the film apart of its notorious reputation may have helped it to acquire sufficiently high rating . Storywise it's fairly simple and straightforward a day in the life half an hour of a troubled coroner perhaps assistant pathologist or whoever he is that is fed up with his routine morbid duty and discharges his psychological tension in a non fashion right at his workplace . I'm perplexed of what particular message the authors tried to deliver with this one plot . suspect it may be somehow inspired by Udo Kier's character's quirky demeanor in Andy Warhol's Frankenstein . Artistic values of the film are also questionable . It's hard to evaluate the performance of the actors that do n't squeeze a single word . Their emotions are concealed behind the medical masks . There's also not enough room for great camera basically the entire action unfolds mostly within four walls . Authenticity effects and makeup are impressive and the setup looks very plausible but only a handful of medical experts can judge how truthful and anatomically correct the dissection is carried out here anyone cares Honestly used to think that the autopsy is done to examine the condition of particular organs and to ascertain the cause of death . Now know that dead bodies are severed raped and humiliated intestines are ripped apart brains are retrieved from the head stuffed into abdomen and mixed with guts then the body is stitched back and washed nothing personal . And what are these poor lads expected to write in their deceitful autopsy reports afterward ? Shock and disgust factor it's much unlikely that an unsuspecting viewer would discover to his horror that the disc he was intended to watch with his wife and kids beside a Christmas tree turns out to be a graphic video manual on vivisection . This obscure item is barely available sought by people well familiar with the subject and not easily offended . Hence it would be pointless to warn anyone to sabotage this film . They are well aware what exactly they are watching and what they want to see . Cerd is really gifted and stylish director which is clearly obvious from at least two other parts of his trilogy'' preceding Awakening amazing black and white short and visually stunning and moody piece with an off and interesting concept . And I'm pretty sure that one day he will conquer the hearts of moviegoers with his new more mainstream oriented material . And sooner or later would become a rarity for the meticulous collectors of his early'' warm works . But in the meantime I'm afraid it may be recommended strictly for medical students or specialists that study mental disorders and sexual deviations .
976_3.txt,0, Watching Showtime got the impression that the producers got the idea to put Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy just for the sake of having a film that co the two of them . Other than that ca n't think of a reason to justify the film's existence . Not that it is n't amusing in spots it certainly is but the concept is so completely ludicrous that the laughs are somewhat muted . The thing that really got me was Eddie Murphy's character . ca n't seem to wrap my mind around the concept of someone being a police officer as strictly a day job . When was working person at New York State Crime Victims Board had to deal with all kinds of cops and they ran the gamut between the really dedicated and some real slugs but ca n't think of one who thought that this was just something do until get my career going in an area far afield . mean can you really see Eddie Murphy or anyone else going through the rigors of the real Police Academy not the screen version just to get a day job ? Anyway DeNiro is your basic hard working detective who's on the trail of a major gun dealer . He's undercover and Murphy is part of his backup . So what does the showboating Murphy do he calls a reality based TV series like COPS to film the action . So DeNiro's bust gets blown sky high but the producer of the show gets some good footage of Murphy and DeNiro and decides on a new reality based television series . So these unwilling partners get joined and try to continue working DeNiro's case with all the TV cameras around . Eddie Murphy's a funny guy loved him in Beverly Hills Cop and in the Doctor Doolittle movies but he's done better things than Showtime and Robert DeNiro certainly has . guess Murphy wanted a chance to work with DeNiro and DeNiro must have gotten one hefty paycheck to do this film .

Mainly as try to avoid reviews until watch something myself and form my own opinion Big mistake ! My is for the first segment which in fairness is actually quite decent and if they had made the movie about the characters in section alone it may have risen above the mark . it moved into TV show territory it stank to high heaven . Ryan Reynolds captured the essence of an actor on the edge wonderfully but as a gay TV writer and famous games creator devoted family man he was definitely less effective . From the blurb on the box expected a flashback thriller along the lines of unfortunately this is nowhere near that standard of movie .

It takes about half the movie for the main characters to realize what the big hilly thing is in the middle of the city is spewing hot red stuff and the other half spent diverting the lave flow through the city using fire trucks right It certainly made me laugh . The acting makes Arnie look like a RSC thespian . It is amazing that films like this get commissioned . more interesting version would be someone going near an active volcano and filming it and would probably cost about to make . can see some guy pitching the film to a film company well there's this big VOLCANO and it erupts in a CITY . radical hey'' If you can find it in the dollar bins maybe worth buying as after watching this most other films would look good .

It is true that American campaigns are probably more professional and more based on expensive studies than campaigns in any other countries are . However this movie goes to far and it exaggerates the differences between East and West . To me it looked like a propaganda movie made during the Cold War .
9819_4.txt,0, Disappointing film with Walter Pidgeon as a hunter who goes to Germany to assassinate Hitler . When he is discovered he is coerced into signing a document stating that he acted on orders from England . His refusal to sign the document brings us to the plot of the film . Pidgeon is pursued back to England by the evil George Sanders and his cohort John Carradine who speaks little but is again as always the embodiment of wickedness personified . Along the way of being pursued Pidgeon meets up with Joan Bennett the latter displaying a wonderful cockney accent . The story gets bogged down somewhat as love develops between the two but again as we approach World War realism becomes the object of the day . The near scene in the cave between Sanders and Pidgeon is nicely realized but we know where that arrow is going to go to . Very interesting that while Pidgeon is fleeing Nazi Germany he meets up again with a young Roddy McDowall one of Pidgeon's many co that same year in the memorable How Green Was My Valley . How green was Man Hunt ?
7309_3.txt,0, The figure of empress Elizabeth of Austria is indeed mostly associated with Romy Schneider and the Sissi trilogy by Ernst Marischka where beauty gentleness sweetness but also history are ever present . This was the Sissi perhaps myth for some however a powerful portrayal . The spirit of the Habsburgs grandeur as well as the spirit of the Bavarian simplicity and straightforwardness influenced much those films . Simply they did have a soul . However Jean Daniel Verhaeghe's film though made years later appears to be a wrong depiction of the empress and her life . It seems to be an attempt to show something different to reveal some realism as a cure to sweetness yet it does not occur to add a lot but rather deprives the whole story of much . Let me analyze that in more details . September Sissi embarks at the port of Geneva . Accompanied by her court maid she goes to visit Dr Mayer Bezace whom she is going to tell the whole life story in order to find herself in this tragic life . The action consists of flashbacks to important moments in Sissi's life yet these moments are chaotically presented and therefore someone not very knowledgeable of Austrian history may get totally misled or confused . Much attention is drawn on Sissi's bad marriage with the emperor Franz Josef . The scene of her wedding night is a failure . No one treated an empress like that mean undressing and payment The focus on Sissi being misunderstood is right historically however the points that her views differ from the rest of the courtiers are not the true ones . Where is her desire for peace ? Where is her love to her nation ? Where is her charity ? Sissi appears to be rather very elegant modern liberal the century's point of view She foremost cares for her looks which is not true historically . Sissi had an inner life which is not showed in the film . Once women will wear trousers'' is a sentence said by her and occurs to be the image of the Sissi presented in the movie . Sissi detests monarchy which is the film's noticeable criticism towards Austrian empire . Moreover she partly accepts anarchist movements and to my very surprise she blames her husband emperor Franz Josef for the death of Rudolph their son . Where is any mention in history that Sissi was present in Mayerling ? Sissi's relation with Sophie the mother in law is better shown however the scene of Sophie's death seems barely authentic and the conversation a bit of clich Sorry to criticize so much but another crucial aspect of the movie which find weak here are performances . Although Arielle Dombasle has her moments as Sissi she generally does not suit to the role . She looks more like a femme fa tale'' than a tragic empress . Her make up is seriously inaccurate as well as most of her gestures as the empress . Malik Zidi is a bit better as Rudolph and may be regarded as the one raising the value of the performances in general . Yet Stephane Audran does no special job as Sophie you simply do n't get the impression of why she detests Sissi . She did despise her for the sake of Sissi's young age while crowned for the sake of her behavior lifestyle and her believes . Partly it appears in the movie but definitely that is not enough . But the greatest mistake is think Julien Hans Capua as Andrassi . Andrassi was a count with pride honor patriotism . he appears to be a sort of libertine thinking only to make love to his queen . And the portrayal is so weak that this performance is very very pale . The accurate choice is Tatyana Ivanova as Catherine Schratt she really fits to the role with her looks and her gestures . But unfortunately her role does not require much time on screen . good point of this movie are some costumes and pretty authentic locations . The port of Geneva is well presented and the moment of Sissi's death occurs to be a good surprise from the movie . It does not appear to be how it really was however the moment is good from the symbolical perspective . empress walks and knows nothing that this is her final moment . That is how she must have felt about it that is how one insane man destroyed a part of greatness of the world . Another good moment visually was when Sissi talks to her son Rudolph on Corfu . But these moments are rare . In sum it's not a good film . It distorts a very eminent historical figure a significant historical time it tries to cure the sweetness of Sissi trilogy but appears to offer nothing creative . Charm is gone grandeur is gone and history is ignored ! Not very worth seeking out !

If you have not seen the version you might like this one but seriously doubt it and urge you to skip this one and go rent or buy the classic one .

9139_2.txt,0, Having enjoyed Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqatsi was looking forward to this third part of the Qatsi trilogy and seeing what direction it had taken . Rarely has a film so spectacularly failed to live up to its predecessors and lost its way . Although it tries to represent civilised warfare'' in the form of sport science trade and other forms of competition it lacks the global scope and even the coherently developed themes of its predecessors . War is chaos but even wars have an aim in mind and this film had little structure and unclear goals . Naqoyqatsi is flawed by being a chaotic melange of images that does little to develop its theme . On the plus side it wisely avoided using some of the iconic images of last century's wars . Naqoyqatsi is also so insular that several times had to remind myself that was not watching an advertisement promoting the American way of life . Perhaps this insularity reflects the ongoing War on Terror'' When representing sport as war'' the prominent team logos ensured that the USA was depicted as the winner . Hence it missed the opportunity to depict some of the many sports around the world and showing that humanity is united in its use of sport as a form of civilised warfare . Apart from newsreel the footage seemed to have been shot on a budget in the confines of New York and there was little recognition of life as war'' in the rest of the world . The gallery of faces gave only a nod to the existence of important personages outside of the USA . The makers missed the point that globalisation does not mean Americanisation . The Philip Glass soundtrack sounded much like every other Philip Glass score I've heard the possible exception of Koyaanisqatsi and at best can be described as inoffensive'' neither adding to nor detracting from the chaotic imagery .

2240_1.txt,0, Quentin in my opinion has written and directed only really one good movie and that was the multiple award winning Pulp Fiction . However most of films especially of recent have been real REAL turkeys . People still rate him and his stuff today and really ca n't see why . There are many other directors and writers nowadays producing far better entertainment in all aspects of their movies . From this point on shall not believe the hype that is a Tarantino movie . Inglorious was too long and worse still you felt it . The humor was well minimal and not that humorous . The violence was nothing new the end scene The dialog was sometimes very VERY drawn out . For some they'll love this movie and for others they'll hate it . and thought the subject matter of Nazis was finally put to bed with the awesome German movie Der Untergang .

But while the Jazz Singer was a sensation for its being the first part the Matin Idol lacks the singing voice of its star now obscure Johnnie Walker and has to make do with just his visual antics . The Matin Idol was an early directorial assignment for the renowned Frank Capra . Capra's first couple of full features for Harry Langdon reveal a very showy excessive style which made Langdon's already mediocre slapstick almost unwatchable . couple of pictures later and Capra has learnt to ease off a bit with some fairly regular and decent camera However he still shows no aptitude for shooting physical comedy . The longest comic routine the stage performance seems to have a few good gags but it's all cut up into lots of different camera angles and there is no chance for the comedy to flow naturally from the performances . Theoretically a good portion of the jokes are in the intertitles but there are far too many of these and none of them is especially funny . Of course Capra would eventually mature into a fine dramatic and romantic director and you can see him beginning to develop in this respect . He cuts down the line closing in on Walker and Bessie love in the scene where she first lays eyes on him in his Don Wilson get up neatly establishing the wordless connection between them . Then there is some beautiful and tender framing of the couple in their scene together at the masquerade which is all very reminiscent of the love scenes in Capra's early output . Johnnie Walker Columbia's answer to Al Jolson is not an exceptional talent . His comic timing is good but there is nothing to make him stand out . Bessie Love on the other hand is a pretty good actress too with a very expressive face . Kudos to her for getting involved with the physical comedy and losing her dignity with the boys . There's also a good role for Lionel Belmore that rotund and jolly character actor who seems to turn up in absolutely everything in the late and early The Matin Idol is one of those pictures that has gained more than its fair share of attention thanks to its director later having made a handful of masterpieces . In and of itself it is a very uninteresting piece and like most of Capra's work before he met Robert Riskin a disappointment .
3671_4.txt,0, Take a few dark and stormy nights fog coming in from the coast obsession and doubt two brothers who have a mysterious connection based on hatred a suspicious disappearance a shoe in the night silently grinding out a glowing cigarette butt and finally a tremulous heroine who finds herself threatened as much by her own doubts as by one but which one ? of the men around her . Sounds like we might have a good minute noir . Instead under the direction of Vincente Minnelli and with two leads Katharine Hepburn and Robert Taylor Undercurrent becomes a nearly two matin melodrama a long slog of threatening angst amidst the perfectly groomed coifed and dressed cast . When you glance at your watch half through a movie and with a sinking heart see that you have another hour to go both you and the movie probably have problems . Minnelli in one of his earliest non movies does n't lay on the rococo hothouse approach as heavily as he later was known to do . Still what is basically a simple story of greed murder and obsession is turned into an endless Katharine Hepburn vehicle . Hepburn shows us in carefully lit close how to demonstrate fear love anxiety giddiness happiness doubt suspicion and terror . Robert Taylor is more or less along for the ride . Hepburn starts the movie as the tomboyish Ann Hamilton an energetic young woman in slacks who helps her father with his inventions . Their housekeeper is determined to get her married . When Dr. Hamilton decides to sell an important formula to Alan Garroway Taylor it's love at first sight . Garroway is the smooth handsome dynamic inventor of the Garroway Distance Controller which was vital in the war and which has turned him into a hard millionaire manufacturer . He's a captain of industry as one of his many Washington friends says . Ann Hamilton now Ann Garroway may still be a bit of the tomboy but her husband shows her how to dress and how to be a successful social hostess for all those Congressmen and judges her husband knows . She learns fast and eagerly . They both are obviously and blissfully in love . But wait . The canker is about to gnaw . Ann realizes she knows nothing about her husband's family . None of his employees or friends seem inclined to talk about them to her . When she learns bit by bit that Alan's mother died in the old family home in Middleburg while seated at the piano or that he has a brother Michael who has disappeared Alan becomes very quiet . sometimes goes into a rage . He always apologizes . But wait once more . Did his mother really play the piano ? Did n't she really die in bed ? Was n't Michael caught taking money from the family firm and Alan sent him away ? All this plays out against the exquisite hotel suites the manicured country home in Middleburg with the horse stable and the tasteful ranch house by the sea . Everyone in the movie except employees are dressed to the nines . There are exclusive cocktail parties and intimate dinners for twenty . Even in a black and movie Minnelli ca n't help but give us dining tables filled with crystal and china tasteful and elegant furniture and lots of gowns . By the end of the movie when all is finally known when Ann on horseback is chased along a high extremely well mountain trail by the bad guy on another horse when she is threatened with death by boulder and her pursuer finally meets death by horse it's a relief . Even Robert Mitchum who plays Michael is unable to bring much tension to the movie . What might have been in lesser hands a taut little instead with the list is just an overwrought melodrama too big for its bones .
12254_3.txt,0, Although this has to be the nadir of season six this schmaltzy episode is n't badly written or acted . It's just that most of us looked to the for taut gripping horror ending without easy answers and moving toward dark but fathomable conspiracies . Season gave us a stream of tongue comedies that undermined the show's continuity and frankly made Simpsons Halloween Specials look like great thriller TV . In this episode Victoria Jackson of SNL fame plays the long girlfriend of a man who sets himself up as a rainmaker . However her weatherman boss is the one who truly loves her and Mulder winds up having to provide him dating advice in order to get out of town . There's some playful fun with the chemistry between the agents and some amusing but none characterization of Midwestern hicks . It's nothing you'd want to see more than once ! It's hard to figure out Season creator Chris Carter seems bored by the whole conspiracy story arc and abandons responsibility to the black comedy writers .

The new one was excellent when saw it with my mates at the cinema but this old fantastic bore has got ta go .

Some parts are very effective and the film does well to give some idea of the suffering of the people specially the children but overall it looks less like a film and more like a documentary . Woody Harrelson is very good but the rest of the cast has performed well without being extra ordinary . Should be watched in order to get a rough idea of what the war did to the children of Bosnia . If one expects a great and gripping movie Welcome . will be a disappointment .
8820_2.txt,0, It's always interesting to view a horror movie after hearing so much praise from other fans . Experience has taught me that you should never generalize fan taste within a genre . My expectations of this movie were a great deal higher than my viewed opinion . Children Should n't Play With Dead Things is a movie with a good intended plot that trips up too many times to carry it out . The whole idea of a band of actors staging a reanimation of dead corpses had me intrigued . However everything degenerated into cinematic chaos . The actors for the most part were competent and amazingly expressive were offered roles that fail to maintain consistent characterization . Some of these characters go from ambivalence about the whole act of defiling a cemetery to outspoken criticism back to ambivalence . It's one thing for characters to have a change heart in the course of the film it's another to produce an overly dynamic circular attitude that loops every ten minutes . Another inconsistent element of this film is the premise . Does the main protagonist intend for the ceremony to be theatrical prank or does he actually conspire with dark spiritual forces to raise the dead ? Even with the aforementioned flaws would recommend this movie to other horror fans since believe that only true horror fans will appreciate the dark atmospheric components and be able to ignore the plot's inconsistency . The scene where the dead rise out of the grave is made extremely haunting to a veteran zombie enthusiast by the excellent combined use of scenery and sound and the great choice of skilled actors chosen to play the reanimated dead . Current filmmakers should learn from CSPWDT about using the proper video and audio techniques in mood development . All in all if you are zombie movie completionist like me you should take time to locate and view this movie . It's a fun watch .

7050_4.txt,0, had n't seen this in many years . The acting was so good as began this time thought Great ! Another movie misjudged as a foolish young man . But then the theme started to be clear and felt the same way . This was Hollywood the seat of glamor so the concept should n't be a surprise . But it is so condescending a concept feel as if need to take a shower after watching it . In brief it tells us that even physically ugly people can seem beautiful to each other and even feel attractive . Dorothy McGuire is likable as the homely heroine . She seems to have been filmed wearing minimal make Robert Young is injured in the war and feels scarred . His parents ca n't bear to look at him either . He seems to have all his faculties and in part the notions of disability are outmoded . Herbert Marshall is on hand as a blind pianist . His character speaks is hushed tones and is omniscient . The best performance is given by Mildred Natwick as the owner of the title residence . She is bitter and dour but not made of ice . Her story is much more interesting and believable than that of McGuire and Young .

9244_4.txt,0, Korine's established himself by now as a talented and impressive image The promotional posters for Mister Lonely all include the film's most impressive compositions there's one in particular I've yet to see in promo material that of a blue nun teasing a dog with a stick surrounded by green forest with torrential rain pouring down The opening images of this film of Michael Jackson lookalike Luna riding a small motorbike round a track is strangely compelling and beautiful Roy Orbison's Mister Lonely'' plays on the soundtrack and the images unfold in slow There's also a funny and terrific sequence in which the same character mimes a dance without music a radio sits like a silent dog next to him in the middle of a Paris street Korine splices in sound effects and jump that evoke both a feeling of futility and dogged liberation in the character's dance routine . The first instance of the segment dealing with the nuns is also strangely poignant Father Umbrillo Herzog is an autocratic priest about to fly with some nuns over and drop food into impoverished areas nearby . In a scene that is both light and affecting Herzog must deal with a stubbornly enthusiastic local who wishes to make the plane trip with them in order to see his wife in San Francisco . As the exchange develops Herzog draws out of the man a confession he has sinned and his frequent infidelity is the cause of his wife having left him in the first place . This scene short and sweet gains particular weight after one learns its improvised origins the sinner is played by a non who was on set when Korine and co. were filming and his adulterous ways had given him in real life a lasting overwhelming guilt . Henceforth the film is hit a succession of intrinsically interesting moments that add to a frivolous muddled narrative . Whereas Gummo and Julien Donkey maintain their aesthetic and emotional weight via coherent structural frameworks Mister Lonely feels like a victim of editing room ruthlessness . few scenes were cut from the film which would have otherwise painted fuller pictures of certain characters due to continuity errors in costume a result no doubt due to the absence of a shooting script and Korine's tendency for improvisation . One deleted scene in particular in which Chaplin Lavant and Morgan have sex would have added much more emotional conflict to a scene later on in the film wo n't spoil it but it's there to deflate any feeling of warmth or celebration and as it is only half The two strands of the narrative unconnected literally are best approached as two entirely different stories with the same allegorical meaning one compliments the other and vice versa . something to do with the conflict between one's ambitions and the reality of the current situation . But there's not enough of the Herzog scenes to merit their place in the film and so any connection between these two allegorically threads is inevitably strained and the inclusion is in retrospect tedious . This is an ambitious step forward from Julien Donkey that suffers mostly at least in the lookalike segments from having far too many characters for the film's running length a flaw that would have been even worse had big star names played everyone was originally planned With many of the imagery's self beauty and moments of real genuine connection with the soundtrack this feels like it'd be much more suited to an art installation or photo exhibition . As an exploration of mimesis and the nature of impersonation it'd lose none of its power indeed for me it would perhaps be more impressive . The loneliness attached to iconic performativity as that encountered by both the icons themselves and those who aspire to be like them is well in images such as that wherein Monroe gorgeous Samantha Morton seduces the camera with a Seven Year Itch pose in the middle of a forest or when Davis Jr. Pennycooke settles post rehearsal with his back to the camera overlooking an incredible tranquil lake . As it is moments like these and all those where the titles of randomly Michael Jackson songs crawl across the scene are married to one another in a film narrative far less affecting than it should be . those who see it lost all faith during the egg scene late on . You'll know which scene mean because it sticks out like a sore thumb as some sort of gimmicky attempt at the new cinematic language for which Korine has previously been hailed .

Claire Forlani Joe Black CSI New York is the female lead and does a pretty good job of it ably supported by the rather delicious Oliver Hudsom and a still luminous Jacqueline Bisset .

It was said of Newman that he could not do comedy but he tried until he finally scored a real success in that genre with Slap Shot . But the failure of this film left him gun shy and he never tried it again . This is one of the biggest downer films I've ever seen . It's a futuristic ice age brought on by who knows what but presumably it's a nuclear winter . Even during the ice age of thousands of years ago the equatorial parts of the earth still sustained animal and human life but apparently not here . Seals have survived and Paul Newman is a seal hunter on the outside . But hunters do need a little and Newman goes to a futuristic city where things are so boring the natives have some kind of game played with six people and it's a kind of Russian roulette . To win you have to kill five other participants in your game . It's a sad turn to see what man has come down to . Which is one of the reasons just could not get into this story . The atmosphere is bleak the story is bleak the people are bleak it's all so bleak . No wonder this thing came up short at the box office . It's a film that just about everyone thinks is never going to be on the top ten list of Paul Newman films including me . This is man's future what a bummer .
10788_4.txt,0, All through his career Hitchcock did great films this was not one of them . man knows too much his daughter is kidnapped to secure his silence and in the denouement all is resolved to the accompaniment of gunfire and rooftop drama . Anyone who has seen Fritz Lang films comes to mind will know how far this urban narrative of crime and conscience falls short of what had already been done in that genre at that time . There is an altogether amateurish air about much of the staging and acting which subverts any sense of menace darkness and depravity that Hitchcock might have been seeking to instil . What it is worth watching out for however is the sequence associated with the shooting at the Albert Hall . Once that kicks off it is as if the film has been given a blood transfusion . The camerawork is lively the cuts are interesting and the way that everything combines to a climax is masterly . Here you can see the future master Hitchcock effortlessly orchestrate all the resources to impressive and memorable effect when the scream comes you really feel as well as hear it .

He has had a steady string of appearances before he burst back on the scene . He was memorable in Domino Sin City Man on Fire Once Upon a Time in Mexico and Get Carter . But in his powerful dramatic performance in The Wrestler we see a full blown presentation of the character only hinted at in Get Carter . Whenever we get to know him Rourke remains a cool but sleazy muscle bound slim ball . This is an Elmore Leonard story and production . Leonard wrote such notable movies as taunt western thriller to Yuma Be Cool Jackie Brown Get Shorty Pick and Joe Kidd . This means that we get tough guys some good some not so good . It also means we get tight realistic plots with characters doing what is best for them in each situation weaving complications into violent conclusions . Killshot is no different . Tough slim ball killer Rourke stalks unhappily married witness Lane . Think History of Violence meets No Country for Old Men . It is not as intense bloody or gory as those two but it is almost as good . If you like those two including David Croneberg's equally wonderful Eastern Promises you will like Killshot also . Director John Madden has not done a lot of movies . His last few were enjoyable if not successful Proof Captain Corelli's Mandolin and Shakespeare in Love . Diana Lane has n't had a powerful movie role since she and Richard Gere gave incredible performances in Unfaithful . Lately she is charming and appealing in romantic stories such as Nights in Rodanthe Must Love Dogs and Under the Tuscan Sun . Here she is right on mark balancing her sexy appeal with reserved tension . This is a small part for Rosario Dawson . Yet Dawson does a good job with it . You see a lot more of Lane including an underwear scene to rival Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut . While you are in the crime drama section also pick up Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Gone Baby Gone and Before the Devil Knows Your Dead . The last has wonderful performances by Phillip Seymour Hoffman Ethan Hawke Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney . Killshot flopped at the box office . More is our luck . It is certainly worth a dollar rental if you like this genre .

It is not that object to literary license that is what it should be called especially when there is no overt attempt to say based on a true story . But this movie is about Beethoven a real historical person who is so widely known and so deeply embedded into our musical experiences and expected the movie to be true to history at least in the primary elements . This movie took such great exception from the historic record it could only disappoint . My assumption had not researched the movie at all was that it was true . Half way through stopped the movie to look it up on IMDb . The rest of the movie was a remarkably different experience . was relieved that this was not accurate with history because it was so hard to believe a major portion of the story . To enjoy this movie was required to recognize it as a fantasy a what if it was like this'' story . The movie lacked this honest disclaimer . What disappointed me most was the fictionalized conducting of the symphony . The very concept portrayed in the film stretched my imagination to the point of incredulity . ended up doubting anything was true to history other than Ludwig van Beethoven and his relationship with Karl van Beethoven . really enjoyed the performance of Ed Harris an exceptional actor who knows how to play a role and keep himself out of it and that was about it and for that give it a Those who portend that this movie is as good as or better than Amadeus have not a clue about either either composers life and are looking only for what this movie really is for in the end it was a cheap novel of a story pulp fiction .
6190_1.txt,0, Algiers is not a classic it is a perversion of the wonderful original Pepe le Moko directed by Duvivier and starring a much more attractive and charming Pepe Jean Gabin . If you want to fully experience the Casbah and the characters in Algiers recommend you do n't even watch this movie and see Pepe le Moko instead for it is much more elaborate more beautifully filmed the lines are not clich and the characters adhere much more to reality . Furthermore the ending is so dramatic and key to Pepe's character that you'll find the Algiers version intolerable . Although Algiers does an almost excellent job mimicking each scene the acting falls short as does the credibility of the characters . Plus the wardrobe is truly breath in all scenes particularly Pepe's in the last scene and Gaby's all times but also when she's on the boat . Frankly Algiers is cheap as far as imitations go .

His work has made it to the point where he can take a human fetus and accelerate its growth to that of an adult within a few days . His latest creation is a omitted but side effects from the process omitted according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Embryo'' opens by promising The film you are about to see is not all science fiction . It is based upon medical technology which currently exists for fetal growth outside the womb . It could be a possibility tomorrow'' or today according to Dr. Charles Brinkman III . Right . And Dr. Joyce Brothers appears later at a party with Roddy McDowall . First we see Rock Hudson Dr. Paul Holliston light a cigarette and drive recklessly that speedometer ! during a storm unfortunately he hits a dog . Mr. Hudson takes the wounded canine home . He learns it is pregnant and manages to save the life of one of the puppies due to his experimental knowledge of fetal growth . What this really boils down to is that Hudson uses an experimental drug to grow the embryo so that it can survive outside the mother's womb . The dog Number One'' grows to adult rapidly and is passed off as its mother . Hudson lives with his sister Diane Ladd Martha Douglas since his wife Nicole also a doctor died in another car accident . Ms. Ladd seems more emotionally stable about Nicole's death than Hudson who survived the crash that killed his wife . Things begin to get creepy when Hudson's dog shows an intelligence level far above any normal dog . Then Hudson decides to use his accelerated embryo growth on a human Barbara Carrera Victoria Spencer Hudson and the cast try their best but the Embryo'' storyline is wretchedly absurd nonsense . If you take away her silly opening and closing scenes Ms. Carrera's valiant characterization almost works she might have been a bigger star if offered better films than this . The infantile ending suggests a sequel but happily the idea was aborted .

The kid Rusty'' is a smart and whiny brat and Willis Rusty grown up now as Russell'' gets abrasive with his constant yelling . That is entertainment ? No thanks .

Because love everything that Christina Ricci does was very excited at first but as the movie continued started to wonder where it was going . Based on a true story it is simply about Christina Ricci's character and her struggle with depression drugs friends and family as you can probably tell from the title . In my opinion this movie moved too fast and it was way too dramatic . would say there was a dramatic moment every five minutes and the movie moved through her life extremely fast and this left no room for us to connect with Christina Ricci's character . Christina Ricci's performance was fantastic as always but Jessica Lange stood out throughout the whole movie and believe this movie's success will be all because of her and Christina Ricci . would rate this out of and would suggest you rent this one or read the books by Elizabeth Wurtzel they are good and definitely worth checking out .

All this movie does is create a forum for hate between people while causing a rift that should not be there . This movie portrayed the Sikhs and Muslims in a very negative manor while making the third group look as if they were non existent in the brutal killings of the people of both nations . The inaccuracies coupled with the sear disregard for one's faith as portrayed by Singh was a disgrace to the highest format . Though on a more positive note the actors did a great job in acting in their roles . Both Kristen and Neve played their rolls exceptionally . hope those that watch this movie do not see or use it as a template for the actual historical event .

Unlikely Hammer horror in which a respectable society figure takes charge of a beautiful young waif without attracting so much as a whiff of scandal even when she takes to murdering all and sundry with a variety of lethal implements mirrors hat etc . Davidson's screenplay wanders aimlessly from one murder to another sacrificing the material's inherent subtext obvious attraction to Rees in favor of commercial melodrama and the tone remains subdued throughout . Some of the gore scenes are surprisingly vivid even for Hammer and these were clipped from the original US release an rating from the MPAA though the complete version is now available on home video . Porter and Rees give excellent performances and the climax in St. Paul's cathedral is a definite highlight but the rest of the film is strangely hollow and unaffecting . Directed by Peter Sasdy .
9528_1.txt,0, Lois Weber's film Hypocrites'' was and still kind of is a very bold and daring film . enjoyed it and was very impressed by the filming and story of it . The priest sees the hypocrisy of the people in his church and tries to show them the naked'' truth . The people are appalled when he reveals the naked statue portraying truth after failing to lead them to it and the few that did help along the way . The people do not want to face the truth that they are doing anything wrong but it shows them putting things before God going to beach parties acting inappropriate their materialistic ways and other things in which the people of our world do that tend to not be morally right . In the end failing to gain any followers he must enter into the gates of heaven alone . This film seems to me to be very bold in the fact that a naked woman is shown throughout it especially considering the time period in which this film was made . The imagery and symbolism portrayed in this movie found incredible . The way they made the naked woman translucent and using a naked woman to symbolize the naked truth shows a lot of creativity and art . Showing the different sins of the people as they walked down the road and refused to follow along the path each with different excuses setbacks and higher priorities was a great way of representing the people of today . This film does a very good job of getting the moral message across to its audience . Lois Weber has a tremendous way of capturing her spectators attention with her creativity symbolism visuals and through auditory . Even the music of the piano throughout this film is very beautiful and fitting with the whole theme .

But nowadays it strikes me that the Nemo he was made up to be bore more than a passing resemblance to Captain Bird's Eye from the TV commercials . Or maybe it's the other way around . His nemesis Professor Cunningham was overacted brilliantly by Burgess Meredith . He never seemed to get over his Penguin'' days from Batman . Although he does n't do his Penguin quack'' here he is without parallel as the maniacal Professor . Only John Colicos of Battlestar Galactica fame chewed up the scenery better as a maniacal despot . never can recall what the grudge was between Nemo and Cunningham but it must have been severe since the Prof. never missed a chance to try and scupper Nemo and vice The effects were nothing special though Prof. Cunningham's submarine was way better looking than Nemo's . It also had a crew of strange fish amphibians that served Cunningham and did his every bidding . However the most memorable aspect of the whole show was Prof. Cunningham's secret weapon . The Delta Beam ! He was forever saying Fire Delta Beam ! whereupon a fishy crewman would horribly overract the motion of firing the weapon by use of a full shoulder shrug . Truly priceless ! They do n't make them like this anymore and perhaps just as well . But like other series of this era for those who remember it it will always have an affectionate if cheddar place in our hearts .
11653_3.txt,0, Based on the comments made so far everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it . think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a GREAT movie it has its interesting moments . For one thing it was filmed on location in Colorado it Breckinridge or Telluride ? ca n't remember but it is in the credits The location is absolutely stunning and spectacular . It's beautiful even to me who lived in Colorado for several years . Next it has Disney's penchant for wonderful character actors . Harry Morgan has never been in better form than when he plays in a Disney movie . He is literally hysterical . Also remember the wonderful Mary Wickes ? Although she has a bit part'' in this movie she is great as always . If you do n't know who she is think of the animated Disney version of Hunchback from Notre Dame was one of the gargoyles and she was also the most interesting nun in Sister Act'' as well as the best nun in The Trouble With Angels . She has always been a great character actress and most character actors never receive the recognition they deserve . In addition to character actors and all casts in the Disney may have not had the greatest'' movies but if you really watch some of them from beginning to end you will NOTICE that every movie has some really funny or hysterical moment in it . The entire movie may not be funny but there is always a comic gem least or in every single live movie Disney ever made . Whether it's Harry Morgan in one of his bellowing tones of voice or Tim Conway floundering around or Joe Flynn giving one of his priceless looks of horror it is all good . The whole film may not be good but there are ALWAYS hysterical moments in every Disney film from this period that have ever seen . Disney in this time period always managed to make a person smile despite the dumbness of the film . Bsed on these comments disagree with viewers who say every Disney movie in this time period is awful . That statement it not quite accurate . Rather it is easier for me to give credit to the funny moments and overlook the weaknesses in the plots . Some live Disney movies are true classics Yeller Bedknobs and Broomsticks Mary Poppins but for those that are n't am able to appreciate them for what they were good clean family fun in a time when movies had become vulgar crude and offensive .
742_2.txt,0, I'm afraid did not like this adaptation . When started watching it had a strange feeling of watching some TV series due to the filter and the musical score . did not like the end scene . Mr Tilney appears dressed only in his waistcoat . Jane Austen would never have a gentleman ride out without a frock coat . Looks like the producers made a modern misinterpretation of a romantic girl's dream . appreciate the more modern JA adaptations much more that show an eye for these details that makes the BBC series so worthwhile . Sorry looking forward to the adaptation . hope that will be better and will show the benefits of years of Jane Austen adaptations .

5_4.txt,0, wish knew what to make of a movie like this . It seems to be divided into two parts action sequences and personal dramas ashore . It follows Ashton Kutsher through survival swimmer school guided by Master Chief Kevin Costner then to Alaska where a couple of spectacular rescues take place the last resulting in death . must say that the scenes on the beach struck me as so stereotypical in so many ways that they should be barnacle encrusted . typical bar room fight between Navy guys and Coast Guardsmen pirates'' The experienced old timer Costner who is as an elderly bar tender tells him married to the Coast Guard . The older chief who keeps trying to prove to himself that he's still nineteen . The neglected ex wife ashore to whom Kostner pays a farewell visit . The seemingly sadistic demands placed on the swimmers by the instructors all in pursuit of a loftier goal . The gifted young man hobbled by a troubled past . The problem is that we've seen it all before . If it's Kevin Costner here it's Clint Eastwood or John Wayne or Lou Gosset Jr. or Vigo Mortenson or Robert DeNiro elsewhere . And the climactic scene has elements drawn shamelessly from The Perfect Storm'' and Dead Calm . None of it is fresh and none of the old stereotyped characters and situations are handled with any originality . It works best as a kind of documentary of what goes on in the swimmer's school and what could happen afterward and even that's a little weak because we do n't get much in the way of instruction . It's mostly personal conflict romance and tension about washing out . It's a shame because the Coast Guard is rather a noble outfit its official mission being the safety of lives and property at sea . In war time it is transferred to the Navy Department and serves in combat roles . In World War II the Coast Guard even managed to have a Medal of Honor winner in its ranks . But again we do n't learn much about that . We do n't really learn much about anything . The film devolves into a succession of visual displays and not too much else . disappointment .

11415_4.txt,0, The key scene in Rodrigo Garcia's Nine Lives'' comes when Sissy Spacek hidden away in a hotel room where she is carrying on an affair with Aiden Quinn find a nature documentary on television at which point Quinn notes the contrivance of such things footage is edited into one scene predators and preys are thrown together in order to capture the moment to force connections where none actually exist . Characters in the nine shorts that make up this film occasionally spill over into each others stories but none of them ever seem to really connect . woman preparing for a violent confrontation with her abusive father is later seen working in a hospital room where another woman is preparing for a mastectomy . man who runs into an old girlfriend in a supermarket and sees how his life should have been later hosts with his current wife a dinner party for an unhappy couple . Garcia arranges some of his characters in front of each other but none of the subsequent stories ever really build on what came before . Garcia's first film the wonderful overlooked Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her also had a short structure and overlapping characters but there were fewer of them and they had a lot more room to breathe and grow . The gimmicky premise of Nine Lives that each of its nine stories is told in a single unbroken take in real time never allows the film to build up any real dramatic tension or momentum . It's also a fairly visually ugly movie . Interior shots are often murky and hard to watch while other scenes one where a girl walks back and forth between rooms to talk to her uncommunicative parents rendered annoying by the camera Given that this is Garcia's third film and that he has a respectable history of directing for television the direction in this film is rather surprisingly amateurish . Like fellow filmmaker Rebecca Miller Garcia of Gabriel Garcia Marquez is focused on the writing and character aspects of his films often to the detriment of the film ones . Individual scenes are touching and even affecting . did like Jason Issacs kissing Robin Wright Penn's pregnant belly . And Joe Mantegna whispering lovingly to his wife as she slips into pre sedation . And Sissy Spacek stealing a few happy moments away from her life with Aiden Quinn before brought back to it with a phone call from her daughter . But the film Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her'' feels more like an exercise than actual drama . We are just watching people act .
2732_4.txt,0, The Core'' meets Crack in the World'' made for TV The acting is stock the suspense predictable . Once you subtract all of the plot ripped off from The Core'' basically the manned drilling machine you end up with the plot of Crack in the World'' Crack'' was a truly excellent movie starring Dana Andrews . His team of scientists working in South Africa drilled down to the crust and punched through'' with a nuclear device in order to provide a steady source of geothermic energy . One of his subordinates also a brilliant scientist disagrees . He believes that the blast will not drill a simple hole but will instead form cracks in the crust . spoiler He is right . In order to stop the resultant crack from destroying the earth they must place another nuclear device in the path of the crack . Although have placed a spoiler warning do n't know if really spoiled anything for either movie . And since Crack in the World is only available in very rare VHS format if at all my decision not to reveal whether or not the counter works is probably academic . All in all rate Descent just below average .
6013_3.txt,0, This film should be called adventures in Cinemascope . It is like the screenwriter and director tooks the Cliff's Notes page outline and decided that this would be a great vehicle for a film about the Italian Alps . Rock Hudson is pretty good here but the dialogue bears no resemblance to Hemingway at all . This is a made up version of Hemingway . Hecht the screenwriter is a hack . Watch the version with Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes . That is great cinema and was made by someone who understood Hemingway and the war in Northern Italy . Gary Cooper is very very good compared to his performance in For Whom the Bell Tolls where he is stiff as a board and thinks he is in a western . Anyway if you are a Hemingway fan do yourself a favor and do not watch this film . Your best bet is to get the unabridged audio CD and just listen to one of the greatest novels ever written .

3456_1.txt,0, Its incredible to me that the best rendition of this amazing story remains a cartoon made by Walt Disney in the but its true . Here another clumsy attempt sputters confuses and alienates would be viewers with admirable effectiveness while successfully antagonizing those of us who have actually read the story . Irving's original work is short by any measure and making a feature length film is bound to be a challenge . One can either completely rewrite the story a la Tim Burton which is a discussion for another time or pad the bust of the old girl with unintended detail . The latter is what is attempted here and if may say pitifully so . Unimaginative and thoroughly modern new facets to character personalities such as religious zealotry in Crane or wanderlust in good old Bram Bones ruin the story's intent and betray a severe lack of talent by the filmmakers . By the time the tale's famous climax approached had completely lost interest . Its the kind of film where you expect to see a stagehand smoking in the background .
81_3.txt,0, Okay so it was never going to change the world and it bombed at the box office but Honky Tonk Freeway is one of those films fell in love with as a child BBC showed it a few times during the and happened to have a high quality VHS tape in the machine lucky that ! and watched endlessly . watched the DVD last night and sadly time has not been kind to this would blockbuster . Either that or I've just grown out of this kind of broad dopey humour . Come on when Schlesinger is so desperate for laughs he gives us close of novelty underpants with slogans what can you say about the cast or screenplay ? Certainly it's ambitious interesting unusual and sprawling but it's never once laugh funny . I'd describe it as a children's film with some overtones you can safely let your youngsters watch this despite the certificate . They wo n't get the drug references so do n't worry about it . had a pleasant surprise when realized I'd forgotten just how catchy both the title song and the song truck driver's Going Faster Faster song were not to mention the town of Ticlaw's patriotic anthem . The whole cast give commendable performances the photography is crisp and captures the mood of the various locations perfectly and there's a real time capsule feeling about the fashions the cars the gadgets the dashboard drum machine the interiors and the pop references was more than a little surprised to hear the nutty bum in the bank loudly telling everyone I'm OJ Simpson ! particularly now Simpson's legal tangles have overshadowed his sporting achievements . The snag is there's almost no plot to speak of it's way too obvious to be witty and not funny enough to elicit many genuine laughs . wish I'd left this one as a pleasant memory .
9183_3.txt,0, This movie is silly and very short of being a funny movie . Unhappy are not pleased with being out west so they hire a drunk wagon master Candy lead them back east . Sight gags were just not funny enough to carry this one . And Richard Lewis gets on your nerves very quickly but then honestly do n't like him at anything he does . Ed Lauter is hilarious as the bumbling villain . The movie was dedicated to Candy . He died from a massive heart attack ten days before the movie was completed . stand in and digital enhancement enabled Candy's character to be seen in the final scenes . Candy was a very good comedian and gave us some real good knee slapping belly laughs in his career . This movie was just not the caliber of his best . Also in the film you will recognize William Sanderson Gailard Sartain Ethan Phillips Ellen Greene and Rodney Grant .

4595_3.txt,0, watched the unrated version of this movie and as a person who has studied the life and crimes of Speck closely must say this movie is a flawed but ambitious take on the real story . While capturing the true horror of Speck and the murders this film makes the following factual errors . Speck did not inject drugs at the crime scene as depicted in the movie . In fact he was mainly an alcoholic and pill popper who rarely took drugs via syringe . The Asian nurse who survived Speck's massacre did not squirm her way down stairs and under the couch in the living room as depicted in the movie . This would have been impossible . In real life she hid under a bed while Speck methodically eliminated his victims . The movie depicts Speck as being violent and brutal with the women as soon as he meets them . Not true . In reality Speck was at first calm and gentle reassuring the women he was n't going to hurt them . This is how he was able to tie each of them up . The real Richard Speck was not the deep thinker the movie depicts him to be . FBI profiler Robert Ressler interviewed Speck in the and said that Speck not only DID'NT know why he committed the murders but that he was n't interested in learning why nor could he shed any light on why . Speck was known to be of below average intelligence and not the philosopher king who narrates this movie . If the story was n't so tragic and horrifying the voice over would be laughable . All in all Doug Cole's performance is adequately menacing and cold even though do n't think the real Speck was so forward in his violence . No doubt he was a very violent person when under the influence but he was also known after all for being a fairly slick con man who was able to put people at ease before victimizing them . Beverly Ann Sotelo's performance as the surviving nurse is the finest in the film . She is a very good actress . If you are at all squeamish do not see this film . It's very graphic and disturbing .

The only existing print was a work print without music or final editing but wherever it's shown Eagels stuns and captivates with her beguiling powerful performance . She is so convincing on the witness stand that while we know she is lying through her teeth did after all SEE her kill the man we in the audience find ourselves like the jurors believing in her innocence before we suddenly catch ourselves . THAT is GREAT ACTING . The film needs to be made available on video so that the world can enjoy this terrific performance again . silent of Jeanne's exists in archive print MAN WOMAN AND SIN and her only other talkie JEALOUSY is lost so this is the only document we have of her . Run to see it it first came out of the archives to be shown in NYC in the early the Village Voice printed a full page review worshipping the Eagels performance
4497_4.txt,0, The photography is accomplished the acting is quite good but in virtually every other department The Greek Tycoon is a dreary bore . Taking its inspiration from the real love affair of Jackie Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis the film is a glossy but absolutely empty soap opera of the kind that can be found on TV all day long . Viewers who embrace the whole celebrity magazine culture'' photographs and gossipy stories about the rich and famous will undoubtedly find much to whet their appetite here . But those who prefer films with a bit more substance and craft and quirkiness will find the minute running time a butt slog . American president James Cassidy Franciscus and his beautiful wife Liz Bisset are in Greece on official business . ridiculously wealthy Greek shipping tycoon Theo Tomasis Quinn catches sight of Liz at a party at his elegant manor . Despite the fact that both of them are married to someone else there is an immediate attraction between them . Later at a private party aboard his yacht Tomasis makes his desires known to Liz . Some while later President Cassidy is assassinated whilst out strolling on a beach . Liz is shocked and saddened by his death but it is n't long before she seeks comfort in the arms of her Greek lover Tomasis . Eventually the two of them are married and their love affair becomes a favourite talking point for the world's newspapers magazines photographers and wags . It is somewhat amusing to note the vigour with which the producers of this film denied that it was a dramatisation of the Kennedy story . They wanted the film to be seen as an original story rooted in fiction . But anyone with a brain can see from where the movie is drawing its inspiration . Even Aristotle Onassis himself knew The Greek Tycoon amounted to his love getting the Hollywood treatment rumours are to be believed he actually had a hand in approving Anthony Quinn for the Tomasis role ! Lee is n't really the right sort of director for this type of movie he's better suited to action fodder like The Guns Of Navarone and Ice Cold In Alex but he marshals the proceedings with an uninspired professional adequacy . Quinn is very watchable as Tomasis Bisset looks lovely as the object of his desires Franciscus uses his toothy smile and a fa of integrity to make for a believable politician . Their performances are good on the surface but there's little for the actors to do on any deeper level . Similarly Tony Richmond's photography gives the film an elegant surface sheen as it moves from one exotic locale to the next but the merest of scratches proves that there's nothing behind the film's glossy exterior .

5025_3.txt,0, Rossini once described rival composer Wagner's work as having some wonderful moments . some awful quarter Inuyasha it seems can also be described this way . It has many great episodes but in between them are countless filler episodes . The entire series consists of about episodes of which I'd say at least are filler or some sort of subplot did n't bother to count and would n't be surprised if that number were in fact higher though Some of these filler episodes are actually quite enjoyable though many are quite silly or dull . Nonetheless the constant digressions start to wear thin after the first few seasons as the plot ends up progressing at a labored crawl for most of the series . Character development too slows down greatly and by the later seasons the cast has become quite unchanging resulting in increasingly stale jokes those concerning the monk who's ironic traits start out as mildly humorous but grow tiresome when the jokes associated with them appear repeatedly However all of that is n't to say that Inuyasha is a bad series . It just is n't a great series the way Neon Genesis Evangelion for example is generally considered to be . As something to watch at the end of a hard day it is nice but it could never be confused with high art .

Sam Sully Lizzy and Piper . love the other characters as well but they are good in small dozes like Derek Darcy and even Sully . It is like the show lost some of its family and everyone else is trying to hard to fill in . It is overdose .

The show was about Sam trying to live his business life and handle his personal life and friends as well . That was the charm .

3570_3.txt,0, have to agree that the movie is not the best I've ever seen but would like to make mention that the actors portraying Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey were the actual Dorsey brothers . As actors they were wonderful musicians . The movie based on their famous split would have been better had professional actors played the parts . Many movies made during this time frame took advantage of the popularity of Big Bands . Most often the movies were not that good because musicians are not actors by trade . Most of the movie audience did n't go to see Tommy or Jimmy Dorsey playing themselves they went for the plot and the music . I've never been much of a Dorsey fan but the music is good even today . have to comment on a previous post regarding the actors who played Mom and Pop Dorsey and that their accents would be considered extreme by a Dublin audience . Arthur Shields and Sara Allgood were actually Irish actors both born in Dublin . You might remember Mr. Shields as the Reverend Mr. Playfair in The Quiet Man and Ms. Allgood as Mrs. Monahan in Cheaper By The Dozen .

In an acting stretch for him Norris plays a cop haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie . Serial Killers are all the rage nowadays and people would like to think of them as a wholly invention . In contrast it's good to see where the current infatuation has sprung from most obviously action movies well as stalk slashers of and While Norris attempts at both humour and any form of human compassion are ham and laughable nobody could kick someone in the head quite like Chuck .

11165_4.txt,0, have recently found this film on one of my husband's VHS tapes blank variety which he uses to record stuff from the telly The film looks as if it was last shown in the eighties and do n't remember having seen it since . It has not my knowledge been released on DVD or VHS although shall browse around for a copy . The film tells the story of three young people two girls one on the edge of puberty and the other much younger and a young boy who go to live with their mother's brother and his young mute Irish wife . His wife also has two brothers who live with them . The children's uncle is an unpleasant control freak who forces his young wife to wear a silver collar whilst she watches a marionette show put on by him and her brothers in his toyshop . The eldest girl and one of the Irishmen younger develop a love for each other whilst they live in the same house . The girl helps her aunt out in the shop whilst her brother helps his uncle to make things in the workshop . There are a lot of very disturbing elements to the film . There is the uncle's treatment of his wife as some kind of dumb possession by the collar whilst the Irish indulge dancing drinking and somewhat forbidden love . Interestingly though have seen far more explicit themes played out in other movies made in Hollywood today . Makes you wonder whether the British film industry and the BBC have some kind of hidden agenda going on . Still despite it not being a children's movie there are a lot of playful magic moments in it and the one Irishman does some beautiful paintings .
12256_4.txt,0, PREY Aspect ratio Sound format Mono lesbian couple Faulkner and Glory Annan living in a remote country house are driven apart by the arrival of a young man Stokes who turns out to be a flesh alien the vanguard of a massive invasion . Despite its shoestring budget and leaden pacing Norman Warren's follow to SATAN'S SLAVE amounts to a great deal more than the sum of its meager parts thanks to a surprisingly complex script by Max Cuff his only writing credit Faulkner and Annan indulge an obsessive relationship whilst living in isolated splendor within the English countryside alternately beautiful and ominous by Derek Browne's eye cinematography though Annan's discovery of bloodstained clothing in an upstairs room marks one both of these doe lovelies as psychologically disturbed which may explain the absence of their respective families some of whom appear to have lived in the house at one time or another and under mysterious circumstances . Stokes unexpected arrival throws the relationship into disarray partly because Faulkner has a pathological hatred of men and partly because Annan is attracted to him creating tensions which result in a climactic whirlwind of violence . There's an extraordinary multi sequence in which Faulkner attempts to their clueless visitor by dressing him in women's clothing though Stokes alien mentality allows him to rise above the intended mockery . In the early scenes at least the relationship between Faulkner and Annan is depicted with uncommon grace and dignity but this heartfelt sapphic liaison quickly devolves into crowd episodes of sex and pulchritude culminating in an explosion of horror when Annan allows herself to be ravished by Stokes following a violent argument with Faulkner . The closing sequences are literally gut especially Annan's final scene which appears to have been clipped for censorship reasons in and never fully restored remains is still pretty vivid so brace yourselves ! Excellent performances by the three leads bolstered by Warren's unobtrusive direction which takes full advantage of the stunning woodland locations thereby compensating for the film's budgetary shortcomings . Originally released in the US as ALIEN PREY .

This TV series lacks all of those components . It's just a straightforward good buy bad guy TV series suffering from obvious budgetary rerstraints that make the action scene moderately exciting . Spiderman nylon webbing is about as convincing as the cardboard rocks in Star trek . Nicholas Hammond is way too old for the role at that point in time . think he was well into his thirties wheras Spider was really teenager at the time . For some unfathomable reason the writers also changed names and deleted important characters from the comic book which again just resulted in the tension between characters basically disappearing .

2143_4.txt,0, Ahem . think I'll be the only one who's saying this but yes was a lil bored during the film . Not to say that this is a bad movie in fact it's a very good attempt at portraying the innermost emotions dilemma sorrow love . esp it's the director's debut from somewhere is it true ? felt that something's not quite right maybe it's just me I'm not drawn to the characters enough to immerse me in their world . This is a simple story about ordinary people ordinary lives . Through simple and short dialogs the director tries to relate a simple guy's life and how copes with the news of his illness by laughing it away every time . Oh ya his laughter was kinda cute at first but gradually it gets to me such a deep hearty roar for a gentle man ! must say did n't feel the impact that most readers felt in fact was more drawn to the trivial scenarios like spitting of watermelon seeds with his sis that clearly shows that they're comfortable with each other the granny who came back for another shot this is kinda melancholic the thoughtful gesture of writing down the procedures for his dad hmm but this is predictable . Do n't misunderstood that I'm an action independent films are my cup of tea ! Perhaps just have a really high expectation after watching many deep films that have stronger imagery . Some Asian films worth the watch Tony Takitani loneliness Wayward Cloud dialog My Sassy Girl like it ! as well lives in local setting Before sunrise and Before sunset just have to mention these even though they are not Asian films .

This creature only needs look at a Pretty Young Thing and he's accused of sexual harassment and his life is ruined . Damn those women's libbers ! Grrr . As my tone might suggest do n't buy any of this anti BS and correspondingly did n't enjoy this film . trivialises the issues of sexual harassment and teacher relations . Sexual harassment is here the product of a Confused Young Woman's imagination and those professional boundaries that teachers are meant to maintain well when the teacher is a charming and handsome family man played by Jimmy Smits ! well need n't worry about those . Sexist trash and even by reviewing it I'm giving it more time than it deserves .
8120_4.txt,0, Dreadful film about a doctor who goes fishing and winds up catching a mermaid when he is thrown overboard . She traps him into bringing her back with him . Glynis Johns in the title role is really a silly individual with a tail hanging out . Margaret Rutherford is the nurse who is supposed to be so eccentric but we see no eccentricity here . In fact Miss Rutherford was not allowed to use her true comedic gifts . Nice to see David Tomlinson in the film . He would get together with Johns in the far superior Mary Poppins years later . Miranda causes mischief in that two guys a neighbor's fianc and chauffeur fall for her . Ask any mermaid you happen to see what's the best tuna Chicken of the Sea ! As for this film forget it .
2978_4.txt,0, Well have to admit that this movie brought some occasional laughs to my face . OK but that does not make it a good movie . Most of the characters are terrible stereotypes and truly unconvincing . Not all of them give great acting performances but some really try but fail because their characters are badly written . The perfect example is Julia Koschitz She changes her eating habits from one talk to the other on one talk she does not drink alcohol on the next she is allergic to champagne she feels too beautiful for most people fact she is but still ends up with the perfect'' fit concerning the looks and refuses to give some more realistic'' guys a chance and so on . The end is very cheesy although like one of the final scenes when everybody finally stops talking and the director gives us a chance to catch our breath again . Shoppen is basically a movie that offers some cheap laughters because it is about sex and relationships assume and maybe some short entertainment . Still the whole picture is one big stereotype and nothing is really special about it .
10201_1.txt,0, This movie changed my life ! Hogan's performance was nothing short of incredible and still have n't recovered from his exclusion from the Oscar nominations . And as brightly as the Hulkster shines in this movie you ca n't discount the brilliant writing and direction that vaults this masterpiece in to the highest strata of achievement in film . If you have n't seen this movie drop what your doing right now and get yourself a copy . guarantee it will blow your mind . And if you do n't like it then just have one question for you . Watcha gon na do when the inch pythons and Hulkamania runs wild on you !
3985_4.txt,0, saw this film shortly after watching Moonlight Valentino with Elizabeth Perkins Gwyneth Platrow Whoopi Goldberg and Kathleen Turner . There are a lot of similarities between the two films . They both have great casts and good acting . They both have stock characters of sisters who are very different an offensive stepmother a woman friend an emotionally unavailable father a dead mother and a surprise lover . Both films have the characters experience life realizations and both films suffer from a kind of conquers all sentimentality . They both add a little titillation with Cameron Diaz in black underwear and a partial back shot of Gwyneth Paltrow naked . Both films seem contrived as if the writers of the works the films are based on did market research and said Ok there's a market for stories about relationships between women so I'm going to write about two sisters with an offensive stepmother'' In other words instead of the drama emerging from the truth of the relationship the relationship is invented to fit the dramatic situation . It seems forced the characters do n't seem real the relationships are unbelievable . The resolution of the tensions between the characters is simplistic with simple apologies completely whisking away years of acrimony leaving everyone feeling warm and fuzzy ever after . It's just not real . Romantic fantasy . The characters in In Her Shoes are a little more overblown than Moonlight Valentino especially the stepmother part . Sydelle Feller is so evil that it is difficult to believe that the father would stay with her or even marry her in the first place . If you liked Moonlight Valentino you will probably like In Her Shoes as well . Enjoyable performances in both in fact the actors bring depth to their parts that goes way beyond the contrived sentimentality of the scripts .

The producers obviously thought that if they mixed plenty of over violence with barrages of four expletives they'd have another Stock and two Smoking Barrels on their hands . pity that they forgot to include wit style charm and flair . And it was certainly a mistake to feature a visit to Welles classic Lady from Shanghai thus serving to remind us how much better cinema can be . John Hannah gets his shirt off at every opportunity a huge American drives around in a Mini Minor as pathetically strains for cult status and even the beautiful Amanda Donohoe ca n't add any class to these proceedings . If you want to see a good Brit film try the sublime
12376_4.txt,0, saw this movie when was about when it came out . recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air . The horror . The horror . As a young kid going to these cheesy films on Saturday afternoons still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end . did n't care much for the romantic angle as a year old and the predictable plots . love them now for the unintentional humor . But about a year or so later saw Psycho when it came out and loved that the star Janet Leigh was bumped off early in the film . sat up and took notice at that point . Since screenwriters are making up the story make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a well formula . There are no rules .
2063_4.txt,0, There are those who gripe that this is NOT the opera but then they do n't quibble with the film of CABARET that was not the original show either . All films of musicals are and have to be adaptations'' or they do n't work . CABARET took more liberties with the original show than did the film of PORGY AND BESS and yet it kept its original integrity reworking the material and is judged an artistic success . The same holds true for PORGY AND BESS it reworked the opera into a dialogue libretto because audiences at the time loved musicals but stayed away from the few echt filmed operas . It would have been economical suicide for Preminger to produce a film of the opera it would have lost a fortune for the Goldwyn Studios . That said this is a fine adaptation . The acting is excellent the Oscar winning scoring of Andre Previn is magnificent as is the choral singing and the individual vocal achievements are incredible . Robert McFerrin of popular musician Bobby McFerrin dubbed Porgy and Adele Addison dubbed Bess . While Sammy Davis Jr. sang his own songs in the film his recording contract would not permit his voice to be heard on the soundtrack album so Cab Calloway recorded his numbers for that release . Brock Peters bass is extraordinary and Pearl Bailey is her own unique self . Diahann Carroll although a singer of fine note has the small role of Clara which required a high soprano so old reliable Marni Nixon dubbed her singing . The Gershwin Estate hates the film and refuses to grant the musical rights although the dramatic rights are in the public domain . This sort of hate feud held up the video release of CAROUSEL for almost fifteen years in that case it was the dramatic rights that were in litigation and is currently preventing both PORGY AND BESS and ANNIE GET YOUR GUN from being released on video . Of all the stage productions given film versions it is these latter two which are the sole holdouts to video . Only a campaign of letters to the Gershwin Estate in NY might loosen up the reserve .
6393_3.txt,0, Yeah know the girls are hot and the scenery lovely but for someone knowing the place it's hilarious . If you want some accuracy this is not a movie to rely on . It starts with the flight from Paulo to Rio aboard a This will never happen on the km flight . Smaller planes such as or shuttle passengers between the two cities every half an hour . The drive from the airport home if shown on a map would reveal an intricate zig zag back and forth . Perhaps the producers tried to emulate one of the very known taxicab drivers itineraries when faced to tourists . Not that it would be a local habit as myself got ripped off in very serious places such as Switzerland . The girls yes . All topless . That's something an outsider will never understand . Brazilian chicks will be happy to expose of their incredible bodies at the Samba Schools parades and wear almost non bikinis at beach but never go topless . handful beaches across the whole country will allow it . All carefully secluded and out of town . Oh the indoor decoration the amazing wallpaper . maybe in Disneyworld . Apart from that it is very entertaining and yes Demi Moore is absolutely splendid .
11716_2.txt,0, This has to be one of the all time greatest horror movies . Charles Band made the best movie of in this little seen gem . Highly realistic and incredibly stylised with a visual flair David Fincher would envy its not hard to see why Band went on to make such classics as Deliverance From Evil Regina Pierce Affair of Sherwood Forest and Tales of the Saddle Tramps With a highly sophisticated story a tiny body with a large head controls a family of weirdos who perform experiments on naked women this movie may be a bit too much for younger viewers and is only for the most educated type of viewer but for those who see it Band is able to convey subtle messages about the human condition through his masterpiece . The head is symbolic of the lost love and longing for one's inner self that we all must face at one point or another and for this reason was able to engage with this film on a deeply personal level . Although many earlier critics have compared Band's film to Re and other lesser works this stands head and heels above the rest . It is gorier but not pointlessly . The gore in this film is well crafted and used to enhance the storyline rather than to just get a cheap shriek out of the audience . Also the special effects in this film are absolutely top notch easily the best work done in a horror film since . well . ever ! The work in this film makes Savini's effects look like the work of a blind limbless hobo . The only problem have with this film is the copious amounts of full frontal nudity which were ultimately unnecessary in achieving the composer's goal to create a timeless epic that would forever go down in history as possibly the greatest film of all time . If it were not for this slight problem would have given this film a perfect
9755_4.txt,0, Step Up is a fair dance film about some kids that get their big performance break . The film is average in every way with little more for the viewer . jock fights external prejudices to become a dancer with an accomplished partner and a teach who sees something special . The acting was fine but the dialog and directing had little to add to overcoming a predictable story . None the less you still feel quite good about the outcome of the film . There were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers that went a little overboard . This is a class film with moderate continuity errors and dialog mishaps . The scenery was good and the characters held true to life . It is worth the watch if you like that kind of film .
6784_4.txt,0, Visually beautiful with some fine music this film otherwise has a fairly trite made quality . The romance between two characters which spans a cultural and educational divide is simply NOT plausible . Of course from early on we knew our persnickety heroine would lighten up win over the locals and find true love but that does n't make it any less woeful that the movie had to take such completely expected turns . This film had lots of promise which makes it more of a shame that the promise was unrealized . Perhaps a nice under on a cold night freebie on cable but certainly would n't recommend paid rental or purchase . I'm sure the soundtrack is wonderful though .
10260_1.txt,0, Before really slag this film off just want to say absolutely loved it . Firstly how many times in the film did the characters use the phrase You're Right . I'm sure was counting in the hundreds before gave up and started watching the film again . Secondly what the hell is with those blue monkey things ? OK so the Dansen family led very private lives and had one brown eye one blue eye but since when does that transform people into subterranean carnivorous blue zombie and finally faithful here will protect me hahaha
11181_4.txt,0, The thesis of Father Brown is that a good dose of Roman Catholicism will solve all of life's problems . little proselytizing do n't mind but this gets a bit ridiculous at times . Some fine actors have played Father Brown over the years Kenneth More and Barnard Hughes are two good examples . Alec Guinness plays him in this film and does all right by him but you did n't see any great demand for future Father Brown films . suppose if you are a committed Roman Catholic it all makes perfectly good sense . It's far more important to catch the thief and convert him to your religion than see he's brought to justice . But that's what were asked to accept here . In fact there is a preliminary story before the main action of the film . Guinness in clerical garb is caught trying to put back stolen articles that one of his parishioners Sidney James had heisted during a robbery . That's the story he gives the local cops and of course this is something that James has confided in him so he ca n't break the confessional . Now on to bigger game . Master thief Flambeau played by Peter Finch has stolen a cross that is entrusted to Father Brown and was said to belong to St. Augustine back in the day . But Father Brown is more interested in getting Flambeau to go back to his faith than seeing him brought to justice . So he misleads the cops so he can accomplish his mission . I'm sorry but this whole thing was just too much for me to swallow . Father Brown I'd hate to say it was guilty of obstruction and ought to have been arrested . And he was under no obligation not to reveal anything he knew about Flambeau the man had not come to him as a penitent seeking absolution and spiritual advice . Author Chesterton a very noted Catholic lay person in his day finds all this very reasonable . Carried to his logical conclusion we should replace all police forces with an army of priests . Guinness borrows from his own Reverend Ascoyne D'Ascoyne from Kind Hearts and Coronets and from Barry Fitzgerald in Going My Way to create Father Brown . Granted though Brown is a lot shrewder than the other two . There's also a bit of Colonel Nicholson in this portrayal . In The Bridge on the River Kwai Guinness also was playing a character who's rather weird interpretation of the rules caused him to lose sight of what was important in the situation Nicholson was in . Father Brown's an entertaining fellow when he's solving mysteries and making the authorities look foolish . We've enjoyed Brother Cadfael do it in a medieval setting and American audiences liked Father Dowling played by Tom Bosley a few years back . This film should have stuck to being entertaining .
2919_4.txt,0, While this is n't an all time classic comedy it is a pretty good little movie to watch if you catch it on a rainy Saturday morning with not a lot else going on right then . Harold Lloyd plays Ezekiel Cobb an American coming home after growing up in China where his dad was a missionary . has come home from China to find an American wife and plans to return to China to continue his father's work . unwittingly is recruited to run for mayor of his corrupt home town when the existing political machine that controls the town realizes that he would make a perfect patsy to run against the current mayor who also is the head of the town's underworld . figure the bumbling Cobb has no chance to win and therefore the current mayor continues to run the town and run his schemes which makes them all rich . Lloyd is n't doing the physical comedy here like he did in his silent films . does a convincing portrayal of Cobb with a reserved understated dignity . acting was good from all involved and the story and script were also quite good . Being made in the film does have some rather racist language when talking about the Chinese and it also has a typical black character from that era but these stereotypes are n't nearly as mean as I've seen from other films from that time . Although not close to being Lloyd's best film movie does entertain and Lloyd is very good as Cobb . wo n't be blown away by this film but it may be enough to peak your interest in Lloyd and make you want to see more of his work .

In the words of the film itself you are very very bad ! went to see an unlicensed acupuncturist once so generally agree with the moral of the film though . i'd include a spoiler but the lack of plot makes this very tricky . overall a cinematic disaster . quotes not a leper at all ! beautiful and bet you're nice too you ever seen a naked man's body ? could n't break a piece of straw . cameos in dubbing Micheal cane harold bishop steve erwine benjamin netinyahoo yoda .

Linnea Quigley who has a costarring role in this film as the sexy briefly nude girlfriend of one of the guys also starred in SAVAGE STREETS . This film is subpar though it delivers enough escapist entertainment and gratuitous nudity to please its intended audience MPAA Rated for strong violence nudity language and some sexuality .

The meddlesome scientists dig him up and find that he has taken the form of a humanoid tree . He comes to life and goes on a rampage and sure enough that Fifties boogeyman the is blamed for this aberration . To state that this particular monster walks like it has a stick up its would be redundant . Suffice it to say that the critter lumbers along like the film itself throwing his enemies into some handy quicksand and giving the main characters one more thing to make stupid comments about . Paul Blaisdell created the tree suit and it's hardly his best work . Over the years this flick has been sujected to many comments like To Hell it can go ! Personally think it's the best walking movie I've ever seen .
10340_1.txt,0, am currently years old and remember seeing this movie in the theatres when it first came out . You heard me right was years old and yet can still distinctly remember what saw that afternoon so many years ago . Was it a mystical trip through the fantastic world of Mark Twain's creativity ? No on the other hand it was a quite creepy film about Mark Twain's dark depressed and in fact suicidal side . One scene that still bothers me was a particularly strange scene in which Mark Twain is playing the organ at his own funeral . Would an adult enjoy this film ? Well this movie quite possibly features some interesting viewpoints that a person with a working knowledge of Mark Twain's writing might enjoy but trust me on this Adventures'' is NOT the film you want to use to introduce your young children to Mark Twain .

10323_2.txt,0, WAIT until you've watched most of all other films ever released wait a year then watch this when you're ready for something with such low production values it that will not challenge anybody's imagination . agree that whoever rated this movie as a ten production has to be doing it to skew the data . Anything above would be odd . Nice to see the very young Sandy Bullock in her poofy hair for the short time she was featured though she overdid the New Yorker accent but other times her southern NC accent did sneak through . Ancient history for this accomplished actress who has grown so much since this film . The DVD rented had two bonus features a mini section that only featured Sandra's bio taken verbatim from IMDb . It also had a Trivia Quiz as a bonus questions . Hope you get them all right !
4495_3.txt,0, am ashamed of myself that actually went to the theatre to watch this movie when it was first released . While suppose its thinly veiled depiction of the Aristotle Onassis and Jackie Kennedy story is well enough done it's a movie that should never have been made in the first place hence my low rating . The film chronicles the tale of a wealthy Greek business shark called Theo Tomasis who woos and wins the lovely young widow Liz Cassidy of a slain American President . Sound familiar ? Yes everything except the names . The cast is not to be faulted . Anthony Quinn plays the Greek tycoon to perfection and at least it's some consolation having just read that Ari himself requested Quinn for the role . Jacqueline Bisset is of course beautiful and sophisticated in the part of all intents and purposes Jackie and James Franciscus has the all American good looks of the President . have n't seen this movie since it came out nor do wish to see it again . seem to recall a fair bit of bad language and some general crudeness . Otherwise suppose it's a sensational and supposedly intimate glimpse into the jet setting lives of the rich and famous frolicking aboard their yachts beaches pools etc . Yes the scenery of the Greek islands is spectacular the best part of the movie . Of its type it's okay suppose . There are no end of TV movies about the Kennedys which confess to occasionally tuning in to and not to my credit . This is basically just another . Far better to allow Aristotle and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis to rest in peace .
8126_3.txt,0, Realty television crew are assigned to cover a small town high school hockey team running into a serial killer wearing a black mask and hoody . Lots of interviews where the members of the crew some of the locals who live in the town of White Plains where most of this film is set into the camera about each other those they encounter in the town of White Plains their current situations and the showbiz side of their lives . The screenplay is often acidic cynical and caustic and Killer Movie essentially pokes fun at realty television shows featuring a cast of characters one might find on The Real World . If this plot is attractive to you knock yourself out . found the characters tiresome and the satire is old hat . Out of the cast Paul Wesley the director needing a big break encountering more than he could possibly bargain for Jake Tanner is a nice guy coming off very likable and tolerant of the crap he must contend with considering the prima donnas and immature people in his entourage who often cause nothing but migraines . Particularly irksome is his producer Lee Batten a tyrant constantly barking orders to everyone her poisonous attitude creating much tension . the type of producer who wishes to capitalize on a small town eruption regarding the killer using the hockey team cover story as a front to exploit the tragedy occurring in White Plains . Those familiar with Kaley Cuoco know that by now she has perfected the pampered princess got it down pat because it's the only role we ever see her in most of the time . As Blanca she's polarizing the way she demands attention milking what little celeb status she has to the hilt manufacturing much friction as she becomes a source of frustration and has quite the potty mouth may've taken the part just so she could escape her usual television sitcom roles allowed to spout profanity without restriction Cuoco along with the entire cast services Killer Movie as eye candy but it's hard to find any character you would n't want to see hacked to pieces with a meat cleaver . Jason London is the sound guy a real creep with a sour attitude often tormenting the others with his foul comments that are uncalled for . We witness lots of personality clashes watching how these self Hollywood types in the cast snipe at each other . The killer's identity should n't surprise anyone it's quite blatantly obvious . Some minor gore but most of the violence is shot off Despite some tame lesbianism not even this is satisfying . Leighton Meester pops up in the film as a cute victim . Director Jeff Fisher assembles quite an attractive cast but would n't be able to distinguish this from the innumerable slashers that have stocked the horror shelves over the last ten or so years since SCREAM . While I've never liked any of Cuoco's characters never tire of looking at her but eventually she needs to come up with a role that does n't consist of her preening with smug arrogance always whining and complaining .
12071_3.txt,0, Woody Allen have to confess at the outset have never been a big fan of directed this quasi about the life of Emmett Ray Penn a jazz guitarist whose star apparently shone for a while then quickly faded . Penn does a credible job in the role portraying a complicated and somewhat neurotic man unlike Allen himself which perhaps explains why Woody would be attracted to this project who ca n't maintain relationships and whose twin passions from guitar playing were shooting rats at the dump and watching trains . There is n't a great deal of consistency to the story . It's narrated in a sense by a series of modern jazz experts'' of whom is Allen himself who relate their various theories and interpretations of different events in Ray's life . The end result is a wildly inconsistent account of the life of a fictional man who seems to have been given a fairly interesting life story by his creators who probably should have done a better job with it . Jazz fans and fans of Woody Allen will probably enjoy this . As for me ? The best can give it is a
2556_1.txt,0, Like the previous commentator on this film too found myself in tears at times during this movie . Sometimes one wonders how a film of such awe awfulness comes into existence . From the first moment when our protagonist wakes up in his New York apartment from a dream of subway trains intercut with galloping horses Irish emigrant has n't had that one its clear we are in trouble . And it does n't get much better . Whisked back to Ireland we enter a world where everybody speaks without intonation and exclusively on the topic of the Irish Civil War . Schoolchildren go to school to learn about the Civil War . The drinkers in the pub divide themselves according to their Civil War allegiances . Remembrances are carried out for those who died in the Civil War . The town is divided between those who believe we should remember and those who want to forget . Civil War . Every glance and conversation is dripping with meaning that traces back to the Civil War . The blurb on the videocover of Broken Harvest suggests that the film is a parable of the troubles in modern Ireland . The only parallel which strikes me is that in present day Dublin conversation is indeed dominated by one topic house prices . If its intention is to offer some sort of insight into Ireland's obsession with its past it fails miserably . It is striking how few Irish films have dealt with the Irish civil war and its legacies . However it will take a film of a great deal more subtlety and intelligence than this one to tell us anything about the lasting effects of such a traumatic event on the nation's psyche . For those American viewers who have suggested the film evokes the atmosphere of Ireland it does n't . Ireland was a horrible poverty stricken pit of sexual repression and misery from which young people fled in their droves . However there was more than one topic of conversation .
6701_4.txt,0, Last night attended a screening of Badland with my cousin . We were kind of excited to learn once we got there that the director the producer wife and several cast members were also in attendance and that there would be a discussion and after the movie . But once the movie was over and the credits started rolling the film really was not edited well enough and is too long my cousin and without consulting each other immediately got up and left . We found out once we started talking outside that we were both feeling so angry that not only did we not want to stay for the discussion we could n't even look at the cast and crew who had been standing near the exit and who we walked right by as we left . have figured out that the roots of my anger were planted during the scene in which Jerry slices his daughter Celina's palm with a big knife so that her blood could be used to leave a fake trail . It was unavoidable to connect in my mind the physical pain he inflicted on her body with the emotional pain he inflicted on her spirit by murdering her mother and two brothers in her presence sparing her and taking her with him when he fled . I've sliced my palm before even a fairly superficial cut is incredibly painful because the palm is so sensitive and it is very slow to heal if you do n't keep it immobile because you just keep opening it up trying to go about your life . But after a very short time with only a narrow strip of cloth tied clumsily around her palm and one scene with a big band it was as if she'd never been cut . My anger reached its peak wo n't spoil this moment for you Celina's final scene . got angry because Celina is by far the most sympathetic character in the film actress portraying her is a good one was you ca n't tell me a good screenwriter would n't know this in feeling both her physical and emotional pain and the screenwriter by treating Celina's emotional pain so cavalierly and with such disrespect also treated me the audience member cavalierly and with utter disrespect . Sure the script has moments of tears for Celina and some dialogue that tells us she's hurting somewhere somehow . But by this time we the audience are feeling so manipulated that we've shut down . The manipulation starts very early on in this movie when Jerry's family's dialogue spells out for the audience that Jerry had psychiatric problems . Rule one screenwriters give your audience some credit . Let them do a good bit of the creative work on their own . Tell the story do n't explain to us everything we're supposed to think and feel . We do n't like it . My cousin also knew she was having trouble with the movie early on dialogue when Jerry and his wife had little to say to each other besides this that you . Some couples do indeed find themselves in relationships so bad that the ends up being every other word out of their mouths . But it's like watching comedians who curse a lot . Some of them are really funny the cursing is ancillary . But some of them substitute cursing for humor and this screenwriter to carry the metaphor to its conclusion is no Chris Rock . This husband and wife team bravely chose to tackle an awfully complex story with awfully complex characters . But they seem not to have realized that the meaning of a story especially a complex one will vary for each member of the audience . Successful storytelling requires paying attention to important factual details not working desperately to interpret the meaning of the story for the whole audience . worked with Vietnam veterans for five years I've heard more stories than most and I'm always happy to see films released that bring their stories to a broader audience . It's important on all kinds of different levels that we hear them . But am less than thrilled that this storyteller decided before the film even began what Jerry's story meant and proceeded to spell it out for us with a very heavy hand . Next time pay more attention to the details .

Add people nowhere near as jaunty as the Skipper or Marianne enough angst to fill a German psychiatrist's office . Throw in a plot that manages to be interesting only episodically and literary parallelism that never delves deeply enough to truly satisfy . Season with a truly morose topic that's been exploited since the first world travelers found themselves very very lost . If THE KING IS ALIVE were n't a product of the reigning czars du jour of Dogme would this film be garnering as much attention ? Dogme is to Hollywood as Danish modern is to rococo . byproduct of digital technology this Scandinavian movement seeks dogmatically strip away artificiality in film by using more natural elements and returning to the essence of storytelling . PEARL HARBOR for instance is the Dogme Antichrist . Director Kristian Levring's saga ponders interpersonal relations and human nature when placed under the fire of a life situation . Eleven people aboard a bus riding through the Namibian sand dunes suddenly find themselves stranded in the remains of an abandoned town . An African local who does not speak their language serves as observer and narrator insights are among the film's most trenchant As the strongest heads off for a five walk to the nearest village the others stay behind surviving on dented carrots and circumambulating their likely future as vulture chow . Former thespian Henry decides that this rather unappealing crew needs a diversion and hand KING LEAR from memory . He assigns roles and the group passes many days learning lines and rehearsing in an effort to divert their attention from the seemingly inevitable . Gradually the cast begins to lose it and the savageries of their nature William Golding might say human nature to surface . If you've ever seen LORD OF THE FLIES you know that these things can get ugly that being in a lifeboat situation can turn even Mother Teresa into the PMSing termagant of Calcutta . The film was shot using an international ensemble of American English French and South African actors who the Dogme dogma dictates develop themselves and their roles quite organically . THE KING was also filmed chronologically adding a sense of realism to the ever desperation of its characters . After up to three hand cameras shot in digital results were transferred to film . The performance that compels most comes from Jennifer Jason Leigh who plays a boho Pop Tart trying to bolster the spirits of the group in any and every way she can . Henry Bradley is another finely played character whose passion for his life's work ultimately saves the gang from utter despair . It's hard to feel too sorry for the others wives and their oafish husbands hirsute old womanizers sulky French intellectuals wealthy men who have more important places to be than marooned in the Namibian desert . Beckett might hate this question but why is this group riding a bus together through remote Africa in the first place ? Life morbidity ! Utter despair rendered in graphic detail ! relentlessly tedious pace ! Enjoy .

I've heard Angela Lansbury was very good on stage in Mame'' but it's hard to imagine anyone topping Rosalind Russell . Lucy was such a great comedienne that her comic bits salvaged her performance in this movie where think she was miscast Really they should have dubbed her singing voice hearing these songs sung at a faster tempo and with strong voices really changes the whole effect . just saw the stage revival in Washington and think Christine Baranski was very good as Mame Harriet Harris the nasty chain smoking agent on Frasier played Vera and she was particularly good . Both would be good casting for a TV movie of this show . Maybe if that production makes it to Broadway they'll consider filming it . Also think Tracy Ullman would be good as Agnes .
1564_1.txt,0, Cultural Vandalism Is the new Hallmark production of Gulliver's Travels an act of cultural vandalism ? Not literally . After all not a single copy of the book is burned . But if this is the only Gulliver people are exposed to to many it will be people will not get anything like what Jonathan Swift intended . Were Jonathan Swift alive Hallmark could be sued for moral rights violations and they'd lose . That's a good way to think before starting a project using someone else's ideas . Swift's masterpiece is an extraordinary vision of humanity . Through his hero Gulliver he travels to places that make him feel big small shat on and'' human . The little people in Lilleput are small in every way . Petty and stupid they fight the big and little enders interminable wars of annihilation over which end of their soft eggs are opened at the breakfast table . Sounds a bit like us . forget most of the rest it's been years since read it . The TV show reminded me of a few things and on the bright side it made me want to read it again . This gift to mankind has been shat on like Gulligan under the boughs beneath the vulgar yahoos and Danson Steenbergen and especially two great actors Peter O'Toole and Edward Fox ought to be thoroughly ashamed . Some Creative Person'' got the bright idea to put the focus on the star Gulliver played by Ted Danson whose acting is just plain bad . He portrays Gulliver as insane . All his travels were made up . Weeeeel . Yeeeaaah ! Of course Swift made up Gulliver ! Naturally the lands he visited were imaginary that's called fiction . His purpose was to talk about humankind and our often awful relations with each other . The travels of his imaginary character to imaginary lands is his method . But these people treat imagination as a disease and anyone who has a moment that Hallmark could n't turn into one of its anodyne cards is suspect . can sure see why Hallmark would produce this crap . It's so bad that O'Toole always profound seems as little as his Lilliputian character . He's in character of course while commenting on the character simultaneously as many if not all great actors do . Informing the character sheds light on it . Our light completes the character . It becomes three dimensional through this act of psychic triangulation . Most actors do this very subtly like Hopkins in The Remains of the Day . Others like Nicholson in most things in the last twenty years play the two parts pretty broadly apart . Nicholson actually plays on the relationship of his two points and with us too with him it's all cat's cradle and he chuckling away holds all the strings . Great fun as is O'Toole . But something here is lacking . He is shouting into a megaphone great as ever and all one senses is a hollow shell standing under him . That's because it is . Look up anodyne'' and there ought to be the word Hallmark'' as a synonym . Harmless bland inoffensive Hallmark is the doll who ca n't pee because she has no genitals it is the norm the average the person of no distinction . Hallmark's hallmark is to have no hallmark . never suspected that such people despise those who have imagination quite so much . Suddenly Pound's Disney against the meta stands out in bold type . Or Einstein's Men of genius always will be violently opposed by mediocre minds . Indeed anyone to this mediocre type who has an answer to any question other than or is suspect . Who more distinctive then that a man who journeys to the darker places of the human soul and shines his little flashlight to illuminate what can be found there ? Hence the act of vandalism . The Taliban destroyed the Buddhas in Afghanistan the Palestinians the oldest synagogue in the world at Jericho the barbarians the great statuary of the Classical age and these things are obviously vandalism . Hallmark endeavors to protect us from foreign foes by undermining our own culture the one that feeds and sustains them . And us . Please buy a copy of Gulliver's Travels wherever you live and read it . Or order it online . like to use ABE Books .
288_1.txt,0, QUESTION How does a film merit two different titles like The Librarians'' and Strike Force'' ANSWER The film is sooooooooo bad that the filmmakers could n't even decide on a title ! This film is a hodgepodge of martial arts death wish melodrama romance and other clich film techniques . The story focuses on a vigilante group called The Librarians led by Agent Simon Forsythe The group is hot in pursuit of a nefarious multi pockmarked creature named Marcos Divoff who captures women and holds them hostage in the lawless urban world of south Florida . Burt Reynolds appears as a cameo in this film and his scene is entirely extraneous to the action . Burt delivers a long monologue in one of the strangest drawls have ever heard . This may have been Burt's attempt at an Irish dialect but the overall effect is a kind of perverse imitation of Marlon Brando in The Godfather . Also appearing in this film is Erika Eleniak who has infiltrated the inner circle of Marcos bizarre world . Erika's character kick her way into an alliance with Simon . The Librarians and Erika will become a powerful strike force against evil in a film that has been delivered directly from the editing room to your cable TV converter box .
6935_4.txt,0, Eugene O'Neill is acclaimed by some as America's leading playwright but for things like The Iceman Cometh Long Day's Journey Into Night The Emperor Jones . Strange Interlude was a piece of experimentation he concocted where the characters on stage look aside to the audience and say what they really are thinking and then resume conversation . It was a nine hour production with a dinner break on Broadway so you can safely assume a lot has been sacrificed here . For the screen the voice over regarding the thoughts is used for all the characters . It probably is a technique better suited to the screen . Sir Laurence Olivier did very well with it in his version of Hamlet . But Bill Shakespeare gave Olivier a lot better story than O'Neill gave his players in this instance . Players like Clark Gable Norma Shearer Ralph Morgan May Robson etc . are a lot more animated in most of their films than they are in Strange Interlude . The story takes place over a year period . Norma Shearer is a young woman whose intended is killed in World War She starts playing around quite a bit although that part is not shown in this version . She makes the acquaintance of Alexander Kirkland and his friend Clark Gable . She also has as a perennial suitor Ralph Morgan a friend of her father's Henry Walthall . She marries Kirkland but then is warned by his mother May Robson and shown that insanity gallops in that family to quote another literary work . Since Kirkland wants kids and Shearer and Robson think Kirkland's train will slip the track if he does n't get one Gable is recruited for breeding purposes . Of course you can see all the complications this can cause and O'Neill explores them all . Gable is so terribly miscast in an O'Neill production but he was an up and coming player at MGM and did what they told him . Shearer does what she can to lift a very dreary story but she seems defeated at the start . Best in the film is possibly Robson who puts some real bite in her dialog . Strange Interlude ran for showings on Broadway in and starred Glenn Anders and Lynn Fontanne in the Gable and Shearer parts . Perhaps no one could really have saved the film because two years earlier Groucho Marx lampooned the stuffings out of it in Animal Crackers . After seeing what he did do n't think the movie going public took it too seriously . And since it's not the best of O'Neill neither could
7089_3.txt,0, Just listen to the Broadway cast album and to the voices of Barbara Harris and John Cullum who do wonders for the wonderful Lerner and Lane score . Then with that beautiful cast recording fresh in mind watch the movie with Streisand as Streisand and Yves Montand reading his lines with such a heavy French accent that a chain saw could n't cut through it . The best part those who need something to look forward to is what Montand does to the introductory part of the title song . Listen as he sings Could anyone among us have an inkling or a clue what magic feats of wizardry and voodoo you can do ? one part sums up the problem that results from casting name stars'' in movie musicals instead of the appropriate talent for the various roles . can just see Rex Harrison entering that scene and suggesting Montand too could learn to do justice to the beauty of the English language .
12405_4.txt,0, Your ability to enjoy The Ashes of Time may depend on our expectations before stepping into the theater . Even its most strident supporters seem to agree that audiences can be split right up the middle in their appreciation of this unique film . Unlike most HK actioners the battle scenes are curiously kept at a distance . When they do happen they're rendered in a jerky style in which it's difficult to make out exactly what's occurring on screen . The dramatic scenes can be extravagantly beautiful with the of Maggie Cheung Brigitte Lin and a roll of HK's top acting talent chewing up the scenery . As with some of Wong Kar early work the dialog could be more precise . In short The Ashes of Time requires a forgiving attitude . Released around the same time as Wong Kar spectacularly successful Chungking Express it's clear that the director is n't as confident working with the elements of the martial arts film . Anyone looking for tense action is likely to be disappointed . But those intrigued by the director's aesthetic will likely find this a unique experience at the very least .
8508_3.txt,0, First off am a huge fan of Tolkien and as one will base most of my critic on his books . The movie is a standard adventure movie well made with nifty special effects nice sound track and fine acting . Now if this movie was called something else than lord of the rings the reviews would n't be half this good as they are here . The problem of the movie is that it takes the basic story line from Tolkiens books but then it goes and hollywoods'' everything it can numerous scenes from the book are eighter missing or changed quite a lot the characters are changed from the book also a thing that think should be punishable What the movie lacks is deep insight of the characters in it know that it is almost impossible to make a good film out of a good book and it did n't work here eighter mostly the motivation of the characters is left hazy at best . As a adventure movie it would rate As a adaptation of Tolkien it rates mean honestly what on earth was Arwen doing at rivendell ford And as for the comments that this movie is the best ever'' can only say that eighter you are very young or you havent seen good movies . Peter Jackson should have called this movie an adventure movie based on the lord of the rings .
5942_4.txt,0, This film captures the short moments between a mother and son in rural Russia as she lays dying . am so torn between being nice to the film or declaring it a test of patience . On one hand the film is beautiful with the sparse dialog capturing the essence of their feelings . There is really nothing to say because everything that needs to be said is conveyed beyond words . The son shows so much care love and patience towards his mother that think it is a celebration of unconditional love towards one's family . It also cruelly reminds me that could be in a situation like this stuck in a joyless place having to take care of a very ill person . Mat Syn'' is cruel reality . On the other hand Mat Syn'' moves really too slowly . Do really need to watch a train passing by the horizon for over minute ? With my previous experience of Telets'' and Aleksandra'' am so tempted to put Mat Syn'' among them as a total bore . guess one has to be in the right state of mind to appreciate this film . surely see the beauty of it but maybe am not in the right state of mind .
502_4.txt,0, The film Heaven's Gate was a good view although still tedious at over hours . But the film took great license as usual with Hollywood . James Averill Christopherson and Elle'' were actually married in real life . Their main contribution to the Johnson County war was to start it by being hanged . Well by starting it mean it came at the beginning not the end . Here's the real scenario James Averill and Ellen Watson were secretly married because one homestead could be given to each family . By filing as single individuals they could get two homesteads . They chose homesites on Crazy Woman Creek actually controlling the water above the land held by a powerful member of the Cattleman's Association . He offered to buy them out repeatedly which they refused . Although characterized in real life as the owner of a brothel Kate and a prostitute herself also in the film there is no real evidence that was true . It is known that she bought many head of sick cattle nursed them back to life and was later accused by the Cattleman's Association of receiving the cattle in trade for lewd acts In the end she was accused of rustling an act almost certainly untrue . So much for this part of the myth of the American West'' which is a gooble of myths spanning a time period of about one hundred years . In real life she and Jim Averill were surprised one day by several members of the Cattleman's Association taken in hand and promptly hanged . Those perpetrating the injustice were never brought to trial . But that was the first link that led to the murder of Nate Champion and the start of the Johnson County war . Quite different from the Hollywood version which shows her shot at the end . Other than that think the main problem with the film was the editor who could have made the action a faster pace by more skillful editing .
11945_4.txt,0, am a longtime fan of the original of this movie Martha Martha and everything that makes that movie great and enjoyable to watch is missing from this one . miss the slow pace the build of characters and their style in small gestures the dominance of lights and moods and moves over dialog . do n't think that the story itself is enough . Martha is more secluded and Mario is not a clown . In most of the cases the things that makes one scene great in the original its is not working in its copy here . The small alterations take away the tension . My opinion is that you should go and see the original . It'll worth the inconvenience of subtitles .

7850_4.txt,0, The Kissing Bandit was the third and final film that Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson co at MGM with . The first two were Anchors Aweigh and It Happened in Brooklyn . And in both Sinatra wooed and lost Grayson . guess the third time's the charm . For romance maybe but definitely not for screen image . Sinatra in his forty's films once again plays the nice little schnook only this time in toreador pants . Poaching on Tyrone Power's territory laid out in The Mark of Zorro Sinatra plays the son of a man who was a hotel owner by day and The Kissing Bandit by night . He's gone and left California for an education and has come back ready to take Dad's place but in the hotel business only . And where does he learn the hotel business Boston . Of course some of Dad's former gang members grown a little old and paunchy led by Carrol Naish want him to lead the gang again . But Frank's just not cut out for the outlaw life . But he does make a good impression on the Governor's daughter Kathryn Grayson . Somebody must have had it in for Sinatra at MGM to cast him in this after the bad reviews he got in Miracle of the Bells . Frank's in a part that was more suitable for Red Skelton . But since this was a musical guess the brain trust at MGM figured Kathryn Grayson had to have a singing co In fact the best number in the film are for her Love Is Where You Find It . Also Ricardo Montalban Ann Miller and Cyd Charisse do a dance specialty that is nice . Frank's songs are nice but nothing spectacular . In later years Sinatra would wince at the mention of The Kissing Bandit and with good reason .

10124_3.txt,0, When na young Eddie Hatch a window dresser at Savory's Department Store falls for a statue of Venus and gives her a chaste kiss Venus steps off her pedestal and gives Eddie more than he bargained for . This creaking example of what Hollywood can do to a Broadway musical manages to emphasize the inane story and eliminate most of the first songs . The purpose was to make a safe popular movie without too much investment while capitalizing on Ava Gardner's upward mobility to super stardom . Robert Walker as Eddie gets lost in a thankless role . Eddie's not just naive but dithering and hapless . Gardner is gorgeous but the only things that give the movie any life are Olga San Juan as Eddie's loving but jealous girl friend Tom Conway as the suave owner of Savory's and Eve Arden as Savory's long time wise cracking secretary . It's a role Arden could play in her sleep and she's good at it . The musical opened on Broadway in and made Mary Martin a big star . The only point of a musical however is to have music . Since One Touch of Venus was intended to be a social satire of sorts Kurt Weill composing and Ogden Nash writing the lyrics came up with a series of stylish witty songs and one masterpiece . Without the satire or the clever songs or Martin an equivalent showstopper the movie becomes just a weak comedy fantasy where much of the comedy is predictable and the fantasy is worked to death . Not only did the producers of the movie toss out almost all the Weill songs they brought in the movie's music director Ann Ronell to write new lyrics for one of the songs that survived turning sharp observation into lovey romance . Ronell was no hack she wrote Willow Weep for Me . Wonder what she thought about while she replaced or tweaked Ogden Nash's clever work . The one bright spot in the movie is that Weill masterpiece . Speak Low'' is as great a love song as anyone ever wrote . It's given one of those ultra and lifeless treatments by Eileen Wilson dubbing Gardner . Dick Haymes contributes a chorus . As for Ann Ronell she was one of the few women in Hollywood to become a major music director as well as composer and lyric writer . Yours for a Song The Women of Tin Pan Alley is a fascinating documentary of some of the women who made it in the business including Ronell Kay Swift Dorothy Fields and Dana Suess . And for those who would like to hear what little of the Weill score was recorded by the original Broadway cast you might be able to track down the CD One Touch Of Venus Original Cast Lute Song Original Cast The music is paired with Lute Song another Broadway show that starred Martin .

12217_2.txt,0, Asmali Konak has arguably become one of the best TV series to come out of Turkey . With its unique cinematography and visual approach to filming the series has gained a wide following base with rating records continuously broken . Personally do not agree with singers becoming actors Ozcan Deniz the lead actor but guess the figures speak for themselves . In relation to the movie it was disgusting to see how much someone can destroy such a plotline . Years in the making this movie was able to oversee every descent story that existed within the series . Not only that the cultural mistakes were unacceptable with an idiotic scene involving the family members dancing style and breaking plates which does not exists anywhere within the Turkish culture . Some argue the movie should be taken as a stand alone movie not as a continuation of the TV series but this theory has one major fall the way the movie was marketed was that it will be picking up where the series left off and will conclude the series once and for all . So with that note in mind me and everyone know would have asked for a refund and accepted to stand outside the theatre to warn other victims .

While they generally do very well at these Virtual Encounters this particular entry seems to be just a rehash of old tape . Any number of girls some recognizable and others not are in this film in all stages of nudity . There are also several clips from other films which are outstanding unless you've seen those other films . There are a number of solo nude scenes doing a number of things some playing basketball others talking still others playing with themselves . The only thing of value in this tape is the very last scene a short but erotic girl scene with a very enthusiastic and enjoyable Sandy Wasko and a more subdued Tammie Hainum . Not highly recommended .
7618_3.txt,0, once saw a bit of this film and was interested to see the full thing just to see why the critics give it two stars the result being that agree . Basically the film begins with Kermit the Frog Whitmire telling all his Muppet chums that they have lost everything and he ends sitting depressed possibly thinking about suicide on the bench . Meanwhile in another world angel Daniel Arquette who had already been in Muppets from Space visits the Goldberg another reason wanted to see the film to show that Kermit really needs help . In the flashbacks it shows Kermit Miss Piggy Jacobson not the original and better Frank Oz Gonzo Goelz Fozzie Bear Jacobson Pepe the Prawn Barretta and all the other Muppets have prepared a stage show for many people to see in the Christmas holiday and it all seems to be going well . But the really mean Rachel Bitterman Cusack is determined to either shut the show or the theatre down and Kermit is doing everything possible to make sure that does n't happen . Of course Kermit fails the last time and Bitterman tells him that they are finished and she can officially take the theatre . This is where Daniel is sent as Kermit's guardian angel to try and help him but Kermit is not in the mood and eventually ends up saying wish was never born'' Obviously you can recognise the spoof of It's a Wonderful Life with Kermit as the George Bailey and Cusack as the Mr. Potter and in the end obviously Kermit realises how much he means to everyone and goes back to find the theatre saved as historical landmark . Also starring Whitmire as Rizzo the Rat and Beaker Goelz as Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Waldorf Barretta as Dr. Teeth Rowlf the Dog and Swedish Chef Jacobson as Animal and Yoda only character who sounds similar to Oz's version William Macy as Glenn Matthew Lillard as Luc Fromage Carson Daly Molly Shannon Scrubs Zach Braff Sarah Chalke Neil Flynn John McGinley and Judy Reyes Mel Brooks as Joe Snow Brian Henson as Scooter and Janice Jerry Nelson as Robin the Frog Statler Pops and Floyd Pepper and Kevin Clash as Sam the Eagle . The most memorable moment for me is the stage spoof of Moulin Rouge besides that and the well known faces in it not fantastic . It was nominated the Emmy for Outstanding Music and Lyrics for the song Everyone Matters'' The Muppets were number on The Greatest Pop Culture Icons . Adequate !
7443_1.txt,0, Violent sequel to RoboCop was directed by Irvin Kershner Say Never Again The Empire Strikes Back will never be as good as the original because it is almost humorless and it is extremely mean and should have been rated NC because of scenes with infants being involved in gunfights people threatening to brutally murder very young infants with REAL automatic weapons and even scenes with a year old using lots of explicit profanity giving drugs to lots of random people shooting and graphically shooting up and killing policemen and SWAT officers opening fire on police officers when lots of small and young children are present and a whole group of children using strong profanity and beating up the store owner is a very old man of an electronics store and stealing and destroying lots of items there .

9791_2.txt,0, Apparently SHRUNKEN HEADS was the last movie that Julius Harris had a role in . have not seen all of his movies but Julius Harris was in many good movies and remember him best from Live and Let Die'' where he played Tee and which was full of Voodoo references something that is common here in South Florida ! always thought LIVE AND LET DIE was a great movie because it had some atmosphere and mystique unlike most of the movies . In SHRUNKEN HEADS Julius Harris is back in his Voodoo persona ! He has a great style for mystery and the occult and his part in this movie is excellent . Sadly the rest of the movie is something of a comedy . SPOILERS Three kids who look like they were fired from the cast of THE LITTLE RASCALS get killed by a neighborhood hoodlum who looks like he got fired from the cast of FAME ! or as a dancer on DICK CLARK'S AMERICAN BANDSTAND . In other words these kids give LOW BUDGET another dimension . Julius Harris goes to the mortuary Home cuts off the three kids heads nobody notices and then takes them to his Condominium Unit where he has a giant cauldron of boiling liquids . The three heads get tossed in along with some herbs spices and Voodoo items . At some point Mr. Harris has the ugly little heads on a table and he spills his blood on them and they come to life as talking heads ! They can fly make jokes roll their eyes and exact vengeance from the Evil They usually look pretty funny flying around but the effects are not bad . For some reason one of the kids always has a switch in his mouth and he uses it to slice people's necks and to cut holes into tires . This movie is weird and funny but only the first time you see it . Meg Foster is in this movie and she looks fatter than Rosie O'Donnell and Meg plays a masculine leader of the local gangsters .

People of middling intelligence if you will who pretend to be ever so avant garde and trendy who think Lynch is a genius . Lynch to me is like Tarantino . They're both great but neither one is the messiah as so many fanboys want to believe . No director can change the world so chill out . And both make sucky flicks sometimes it just happens . Everyone has a bad day . And clearly since this movie was actually designed as a pilot first and then hack into a feature film it was n't made with all the passion and forethought one should put into a movie . Face it much of the movie is gibbering unintelligibility which can not be understood . We can all make up meanings Lynch may have his own view but none of that matters . It was strewn about the screen incoherently . Admittedly the first portion had the semblance of an intentionally convoluted passingly interesting story but then it falters . The cowboy the mysterious organization of men with their phonecalls the lawyers . come on . can almost picture David Lynch yelling cut forcing the crew to gather around him and explaining to them all Look how crazy and weird am ! Is n't it great ? It's so weird and crazy ! Weird and crazy works if it's a by of your style . However it's pretentious and tired when you go out of your way to do nothing but that . It's like all those half assed Pulp Fiction throw backs that came out after Pulp Fiction . It's just not cool .
7578_2.txt,0, do n't know but the movie was just too similar to other movies I've seen . The Ring The Eye Dark Water they're all the same to me . Do n't get me wrong it's beautifully made lovely camera work great graphics but that story is just too . too common . In the end it's the score that makes the suspense you know the screams rumbles . The characters in the movie are also not reacting very naturally moving very slowly surprised by anything they see . know some people that love this kind of film and if you do being a well made movie guess it does n't hurt to watch it . But if you've seen the movie I've mentioned above and did n't like them then I'd suggest you do n't bother .
3867_4.txt,0, Well . were some great creamy facial shots of Marlene along with her shocking'' gender outfit her not transmogrification'' from ape into human being but overall the generally unconvincing plot and dated acting not to mention the less than engaging tunes coming from Miss Dietrich's baritone'' voice little to ensure Blonde Venus a permanent place in my mind's Pantheon of Memorable Films . Cary Grant still in the throes of cinematic infancy seemed as though he was forever looking to find himself'' while Herbert Marshall was probably never anything BUT Herbert Marshall from the day he was born until the day he died . Naturally from an historical point of view Blonde Venus was fun to watch so long as one was able to put aside . expectations''
10100_3.txt,0, When the Legends Die is a powerful moving story of an orphaned Ute Indian who goes on to become Tom Black Bull a champion bronc rider . Raised in the old ways Tom is given a white man's name and must adopt the language and ways of the white man to live in that world . Bitter about the role he has been forced into Tom finds fulfillment doing one thing busting horses riding them to death in the rodeo . The movie has Richard Widmark in the role of Red the man who befriends Tom and acts as his manager . Red is a drunk who eventually dies in the story which is about where the movie ends . The real story is completely ignored the dark side of Tom Black Bull who develops a reputation as a killer of horses in the rodeo arenas . Oh well you should read the book this movie does n't come close to doing the story justice .
8881_4.txt,0, then the second half of this movie is hard to follow . got the first part with the Spanish Inquistion but the film skipped many years forward with the French ruling Spain . The movie does little to fill you in on what happened and do n't remember much about it . So the movie gets confusing then . The movie begins when Ines daughter of a rich merchant is accused of Judiasm by the church specifically Father Lorenzo . She is put to the Question and forced to confess . Even her family's wealth can not buy her out of prison . Her father forces Lorenzo to sign a confession saying he is the offspring of a chimp in hopes of getting Ines released . All it does is give a reason for the church to condemn Lorenzo who runs off to France . Then the movie skips many years and the French Revolution is in full force . Ines is released from prison . It was very good make up work to make Natalie Portman look that tore up . She finds her family dead and seeks Goya for her help . She tells him she had a child in prison . Goya sets up a meeting between her and Lorenzo whom is now with the French and in power . He is the father . Goya sees the daughter and tells Lorenzo whom decides it's best to send her off to America so no one will find out . But before his plans get carried out the British join the Spainish and Spain reclaims power and he is now the persecuted . That part is not well told in the film . It's like the film shows this to happen in a day . FINAL VERDICT The movie is good until it skips many years in time after the Inquistion then the movie expects you to understand what is going on . It just got too confusing to me then .
3_4.txt,0, Wow another Kevin Costner hero movie . Postman Tin Cup Waterworld Bodyguard Wyatt Earp Robin Hood even that baseball movie . Seems like he makes movies specifically to be the center of attention . The characters are almost always the same the heroics the flaws the greatness the fall the redemption . Yup within the minutes of the movie we're all supposed to be in awe of his character and it builds up more and more from there . And this time the story story ? is just a collage of different movies . You do n't need a spoiler you've seen this movie several times though it had different titles . You'll know what will happen way before it happens . This is like mixing An Officer and a Gentleman with Backdraft but both are easily better movies . Watch Backdraft to see how this kind of movie should be made and also to see how an good but slightly underrated actor Russell plays the hero .
9380_2.txt,0, The only good thing about Persepolis is the shadows created in the German Expressionism of animation and a hint of history . This movie bored me . It was about a woman dissatisfied with her culture who tries everything else and then goes back to her roots . Here she finds great discontentment once again and finally leaves for final to let everyone else in her country figure out the situation and what they will do now that she is not there to support them . It comes to no conclusion and leaves us with a feeling that this woman has no loyalties . Mind you she is torn between cultures and does n't have enough of a background it seems to figure what is important and real . She is listening to ever voices and will most likely end up a world citizen of some kind than one with any ties to her native culture of Iran . The only thing received from this movie was angst .
6314_3.txt,0, Spoilers abound . You have been warned . was thoroughly disappointed this being my first STREET FIGHTER movie have seen dare not go near the joke yet Very little grabs your attention in STREET FIGHTER ZERO as opposed to most japanimation . The fights are hilariously done over board versus Zangief was a laugher and the dramatization is far too moody especially toward the end when Ryu has to control everything in his fight against his brother . The main street fighter Ryu has been weakening to a far darker version inside of himself . Frustrations in controlling this darkness are further complicated by the sudden arrival of a younger brother ! shady street fighting tournament is held with more than just fighting on the promoter mind . What is with the artist drawing of feet ? Any anime drawn above the stomach is impressive . The story soft nature makes the STREET FIGHTER genre far too intelligent and places far more emphasis on a character that is not even a fighter in the video game ! character study on more than just the core stars of the original STREET FIGHTER is completely ignored . How many times did you catch Rolento ? Adon ? Guy ? STREET FIGHTER ZERO lacks the imagination of the video game .
539_3.txt,0, Well OK I've seen Wrath of the Ninja . It is n't something that would recommend to people who are n't seriously into japanese fighting movies . This is a sort of japanese fighting ninja movie with a complex plot . It's about these old ninja schools that had these Swords of Sorcery'' saw the subtitled version recommended by the way it's easy to miss something and did n't really keep up with it all . It had some good scenes tough but in general it was n't much to my liking .
9433_1.txt,0, Meet Cosmo Priestley a nerdy young bookie content with his boring life crunching numbers for the mob and living in a stark basement apartment at a senior citizens center . His only recreation is watching TV and the occasional tryst with his quirky prostitute pal Honey Garofalo But one day all this changes when the mob boss is killed and the well Cosmo is selected by the smooth and persuasive new chief Gordon Loggia to become a full hit man . It's an offer the reluctant Cosmo can not can not and he quickly trades in his mundane solitary existence for a crash course in revenge under the tutelage of veteran mobster Steve Riegert a relaxed suburban bon vivant who relishes the job's maximum pay and minimum hours . In no time Cosmo surprises both himself and mentor Steve by displaying an absolutely uncanny aptitude for the work . Though he's never touched a gun before Cosmo proves to be both a crack marksman and after an initial wave of moral hesitancy a cool detached killer . Soon Cosmo is dispatching deadbeat clients with speed and style and his natural flair with a gun quickly establishes him as an invaluable addition to Gordon's mob . Reality gets in the way though when one night while being massaged by Honey Cosmo admits feeling a bit uptight and she recommends he try yoga to relax . Cosmo takes her advice and joins a nearby yoga class taught by a beautiful young woman named Jasmine Williams Cosmo is instantly taken with the kind and gentle Jasmine who soon becomes drawn to Cosmo . Now if she can just get rid of her pesky abusive boyfriend Randy Charles maybe she and Cosmo can actually start something . Cosmo using some of the skills'' of his new trade eventually persuades Randy to disappear and his relationship with Jasmine takes off . Writer Wallace Wolodarksy a two Emmy Award for his work on The Tracy Ullman Show'' and The Simpsons'' has fashioned a script fusing his three genre loves like comedies gangster movies and romances explained Wolodarsky so essentially smashed together all three to create this film . But what he's come up with is a film so disjointed and improbable that it looks just like a very long sketch on Saturday Night Live . It's monotonous tone does n't so much match it's droll sense of humor as underline the fact that a lot of money was spent on a vehicle for Jason Priestly to blithely shatter his nice guy image which does n't even fully succeed because he plays his character not as a nerd but as a laconic zombie . nerd may be naive but a nerd has passion . Passion for inwardly directed things . But Priestly plays his character as mentally deficient almost the anti Gump . Unfortunately Coldblooded'' does n't have the sense of scope to actually BE the anti Gump . Peter Riegert Hero Animal House turns in a fine performance as usual and Kimberly Williams does her best with what she has to work with but Janeane Garofalo Larry Sanders Show is practically wasted in her role as Cosmo's friend . Probably not for long though . Garofalo has all the enthusiasm and charm of an apple waiting to be picked and it's just a matter of time before she'll be given a meaty role hopefully doing a tag team thing with Marisa Tomei .
7849_4.txt,0, Perhaps the director was trying for another PIRATE Garland and Kelly musical but this lame musical epoch falls flat . Sinatra and Kathryn Graysons voices do not blend well and their chemistry together lacks spark . The premise of Sinatra as a sweet guy who tries to impersonate his late bandito'' father is okay but he seems awkward in the role . What's amazing and wonderful here is how Sinatra can take a rather insipid song and make it seem special his phrasing and eloquence as a singer make you want to hear it again . When Grayson sings the same songs it's hard to believe she's not singing something entirely different and not nearly as interesting . She has her big moment with Love Is Where You Find It'' which suits her perfectly and shows off her abilities . The photography is lucious and both stars look appealing as do the costumes and sets . Co Mildred Natwick and Carroll Nash put lots of energy into making the impossible work . Aside from Sinatra's singing there is a strange menage dance with Ricardo Montalban Cyd Charisse and Ann Miller . It's fascinating and weird . Montalban and Charisse were a wonderful dancing team and this number is a real oddity .
3492_3.txt,0, Given this film's incredible reviews was expecting something truly exceptional . It certainly starts well with witty and sharp dialogue and a fine cast in place . series of Robert Altman interwoven stories reel the viewer in with some compelling scenes . found it gripping entertainment right through to the second half of the film when sadly it collapses like a pack of cards . series of ludicrous coincidences and right messages stack up until I'm left deeply disappointed and wondering what all the fuss is about . Paul Haggis has tackled the subject of race in LA and that alone seems to have elevated this movie to a new level of interest . Given that most of the Academy voters live in LA and have experienced racism to some extent this film is sure to have an impact on them . That means the Oscar for Best Picture will go to the race movie or the gay movie . Let's hope it is the latter because Brokeback Mountain is a bona fide masterpiece that deserves recognition .
3240_4.txt,0, So many bad reviewers it made me wonder what people are thinking while watching a simple flick made by a quite bad director ? Did you all expected a super flawless movie ? No way you already can see Raj Kumar Kohli loves multi movies . All of his earlier works where multi but no one was flawless . Take the first Jaani Dushman for instance so many flaws but still good fun . Anyways sticking to the movie the movie Jaani Dushman is a Hindi fantasy film about a snake who can take any form Kohli which takes revenge for the suicide of its lover Koirala on the people who caused it . Its quite good with a great star But think it could have been much much better . For instance take the script ca n't say its flawless . For example Take the ages Do yrs old still study in university ? There are many many more wo n't list more but there are dozen more . solid is good for this one .
563_4.txt,0, This movie should have been called The Eyes of Alexander'' and they should have done away with the Bogart concept altogether . The film started out with a lighthearted approach to Bogart's legacy and some comical moments with his surgery oriented face but after the first minutes it morphs into a more serious thriller where two palm size sapphires purportedly laid as eyes into a marble headpiece of Alexander the Great for him and seen by him right before his death . So the gems are of great value not only because of their quality and size but also because of the tie to the Greatest conquerer the world has ever known . Being an expert on Alexander qualifies me to say that this is wholly and completely a fiction but it makes for a good movie anyway . So the film winds around some early silliness and stumbles along with all sorts of Alexander allusions in both the foreground and background really liked ending with a dated shark attack could n't go to a movie in without some shark showing up to menace the audience There is a yacht named Euridice father's young wife a man named Alexander Philip Cleitus ? been about years since I've seen the film so ca n't remember all the details Olympias some street names and many others . It was fun to watch the film just to try to catch all the background details that the director an Alexanderphile himself put in . When all is said and done the eyes are retrieved and the camera pans in on them on a bed as the credits roll by . Kind of a neat ending . What would have been more fun would be if they went the Indiana Jones way and had an action adventure . There were many many real artifacts that could have been used to make this more interesting or instance the hand Aristotle version of the Iliad that Alexander kept with him all his life even on his many journeys across Asia be of incalculable value if found today Olivia Hussey all time favorite actress killed off way too early and should have been the main actress throughout not the girl from the Momma's and the Poppa's . she was herself easy on the eyes . If you can find this flick it might be worth checking out for the historical stuff and to see Olivia Hussey in an extremely funny deadpan humor bit early on but beyond that I'd pass on it for something more entertaining . Yours Nick
