My question is why ? think this movie is pretty good . Dee Snider did very well for his first only time directing . He also plays the antagonist Captain Howdy Hendriks This movie seems to have a view of the future . Although it came out back in it seems to be about modern issues . Internet predators seems to be the underlying plot here . Although taken to another level this is an issue which we still face today . I'll admit the story fell short a few times but that does n't make this a bad movie at all . Robert Englund is even in this movie that automatically makes it better .

The plot is ludicrous the script is terrible the acting is hammy throughout the special effects . let's not even go there ! all in all this movie is a veritable delight ! Highlights of the film include Ator and Thong mute companion not his undergarments being attacked by invisible assailants in a cave saved on the fx budget there !

The movie is called Arachina it has a no name cast and do not mean no name as in actors who play in little seen art house films . mean no name as in your local high school decided to make a film no name and it might have a dollar budget . So what does one expect ? Hitchcock ? felt the movie never took itself seriously which automatically takes it out of the worst movie list . That list is only for big budget all star cast movies that takes itself way too seriously . THe movie The Oscar comes to mind most of Sylvester Stallone's movies . THe two leads were not Hepburn and Tracy but they did their jobs well enough for this movie . The woman kicked butt and the guy was not a blithering idiot . The actor who played the old man was actually very good . The man who played anal retentive professor was no Clifton Webb but he did a god job . And the Bimbo's for lack of a better were played by two competent actors . laughed at the cent special effects . But that was part of the charm of the movie . It played like a hybrid Tremors meets Night of the Living Dead . The premise of the movie is just like all Giant Bug movies of the Meteor or radiation stir up the ecosystem and before you know it we have Giant Ants Lobsters rocks or Lizards terrorizing the locals . meteor was the cause of the problems this time . was was very entertained . did n't expect much and go a lot more then bargained for .,1,0,0.9054556149909404,0.0945443850090597
10581_10.txt, real ryan funny weak bam s ryan s bad interested steve bad worst raab s overall certain different different cheap spare main ok n funny stupid terrible occasional nude many, Haggard The Movie is the real life story of Ryan Dunn and his girlfriend who cheated on him also with the help from his two friend skate boarder who lives for nothing and trying funny scientist does n't really work played by Bam Margera and Brandom Dicamillo . The film Haggard The Movie also has a lot of the characters from Jackass etc but to say it was written by Bam Margera and Co. this is a very weak attempt seems to me like it was written when he was bored or as a project with they did not pay a lot of attention to . The films also stars Bam's girlfriend Jennifer Rivell who plays Glauren Ryan's girlfriend who basically cheated on him again very bad acting by Jennifer another actor that some people may be interested in is Steve Hellboy played by RakeYohn which his character does not seem to be with the story again bad acting also this character does not really have a lot of lines in this film which basically makes it very boring . but worst of all is Raab's character the voice sound like a smoker who basically has throat cancer also think he could have been improved ! Overall think the characters in this film are n't with the story like in one scene it would be on one certain character a minute later a different scene different character . To say that this is supposed to be a film sort of a documentary its not played by the characters as a documentary the acting makes you think that its a cheap attempt at making a film with your spare time . Towards the middle of the film we start to lose focus on the main character Ryan Dunn although a lot of the attention is on Bam and Brandon . In conclusion this film is OK if you laugh at things that are n't very funny stupid stunts terrible acting and the occasional nude scene ! Also think there there are too many scenes of just no talking and just music !,1,0,0.9850321407729262,0.0149678592270737
9380_9.txt, accurate bad next hidden short other bad bad bad humorous bad somber empty true low fortunate dark sympathetic awful yellow scary successful eerie such unintentional intentional i actual old good sure yellow bizarre n gothic bad i above obscure long, Never has the words hidden gem'' been so accurate . Bad movie lovers might search all over for the next hidden obscurity sometimes coming up short with stuff like Weasels rip my flesh but other times luck will prevail and you might end up with something like Death Bed then hopefully realizing it's not a bad movie at all it just has a bad title and not even a bad title but a humorous one that might throw you off but Somehow Death Bed still fits into the bad'' category . With a vibe that's somber and empty Death Bed is a true masterpiece of low horror reserved only for those fortunate enough to appreciate such a dark shadow of a vision . Death Bed involves an incoherent yet intriguing relationship between a demon in the bed and the sympathetic ghost trapped in the portrait who only wishes he could spare someone from the awful fate of being devoured by the yellow suds . Although not all that scary considering it's about a killer bed Death Bed possesses the qualities that make for successful horror . dark desolate vibe confusion an eerie subtle score and that dream quality that this masterpiece almost flaunts . Such a quality or vibe usually seems unintentional . Not only is it intentional but from what I've read Death Bed is based on an actual dream George Barry the director successfully transferred dream to film only a genius could accomplish such a task . Old mansions make for good quality horror as do portraits not sure what to make of the killer bed with its killer yellow liquid quite a bizarre dream indeed . Also this is n't quite the brand of was expecting considering the title and all . Before viewing this Gothic gem expected something more like Class Reunion Massacre now thats a bad movie if you've seen it you know what I'm saying . After considering all of the above feel like Death Bed deserves only eight stars but since it stayed so obscure for so long We'll say the bed that eats deserves nine .,1,0,0.9376504859025954,0.0623495140974046

Afterwards did n't even want to see any films for a long time any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison . For many it may be the worst of Antonioni very slow without an engaging conventional story line microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions and the worst of Wenders verbose confused transcendentalism . It is composed of short distinct episodes linked by Wenders typical meandering hero's stream of consciousness so it does n't produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema .

Second the changes from book to film . although when was following the development of the film complained about the change of some characters and the complete removal of others got ta admit was wrong . it was refreshing that the film did n't follow the book in exactly the same way like it was done in Da Vinci . if you are a purist of the book some of them may upset you though . However the BIG TWIST is still there so do n't worry about that . finally i'm glad they removed some silly sub and did n't even try to hint at the possibility of Langdon and Vittoria getting together . The performances are really good but nothing out of the ordinary . that's okay for a film like this . i'd give it a mainly because it delivers what it promises entertainment pure entertainment,1,0,0.9444634863608962,0.0555365136391037

Very disappointing in comparison with RoS . Terrible costuming and backgrounds . While enjoyed the Sheriff who took cues from the Nick Grace character the rest of the cast left much to be desired . As a for instance'' Marion's costuming looked suspiciously like it came from Walmart . And Sir Guy well he looked a bit like a character from an outer space movie ! RoS has stolen the spotlight probably forever in the telling of this tale . Cast costuming story lines scenery filming and soundtrack by Clannad are all superb as is evidenced by all the continual feedback some years on . RoS is a timeless classic .

It's disgusting but in a way not unwatchable . It's SO over the top and is so unapologetic about it that it's kind of fascinating . As director John Waters might say it's bad taste done well . Also it's kind of amusing to watch acting is so wretched by Massey that you just watch it in disbelief . friend laughed out loud at how bad Massey was improved in later pictures This is NOT for people who are easily offended . Even though it's over years old it's STILL shocking .

8510_8.txt, i sick tired weak thunderball unmistakable tremendous universal such unintelligent true opening twelfth last worst entire own many other weak sure sean little least narrative clear unknown near most recent cheek more more james super gray poor hilarious free young sean good least better else able elaborate nuclear much new better urine good sexual mr prevalent urine s good comic s super much best entire secret worst special fake impressive colored worst entire fatima own more classic simple frickin casual memorable best entire laughable many due large anticlimactic underwater obvious crucial alive fast muted ranks, I'm sick and tired of people complaining that Never Say Never Again is just a weak remake of Thunderball . Yes that movie's influence is unmistakable but the tremendous and almost universal inferiority of re films is reserved for such thoughtless and unintelligent films like the re of Psycho . While it's true that the opening theme of the twelfth Connery's last Bond film is one of the worst of the entire series the film itself still manages to stand on its own despite many other weaknesses . Besides that even the weak title song is made to blend pretty nicely with the closing dialogue in the film . Sure Sean Connery was getting a little on in age when this movie was filmed least by James Bond standards but there is plenty of evidence in the narrative that makes it clear that this was not exactly unknown to the filmmakers . James Bond is near retirement before he is handed his assignment having spent most of recent time teaching not doing and there is even the tongue in cheek insistence from that he pay more attention to his health dieting and training and getting more exercise and whatnot . Besides this is James Bond remember ? This guy is supposed to be some kind of super human and all of his fans are getting all upset because he's got some gray hairs . When this guy retires at the end of the film sends poor a hilarious cameo from Rowan Atkinson to tell Bond that without him he worries about the safety of the free world and all of you people ca n't get over the fact that he's not a sprightly young man anymore . Come on Sean Connery could STILL play James Bond just as good as he ever could or at least better than anyone else ever has been able to . The majority of the film deals with the elaborate plan to steal nuclear missiles and hold the world hostage Dr . Evil would say hell let's just do what we always do'' so there's clearly not much new there but this is one of the Bond films that had the better one liners . There's the amusing scene where Bond is asked for a urine sample you could just fill this beaker for me'' here ? There are a lot of good one but the sexual innuendos aimed at Mr . Bond are especially prevalent in this installment . But then later he happens to throw that very urine sample into a villain's face making him scream as if his face were burning off . Not a very good attempt at comic relief especially since this guy had been kicking Bond's ass with some sort of super device that could cut through pretty much anything . And of course Kim Basinger stars in this film as one of the best Bond girls of the entire series . It's no secret that Never Say Never Again has dated badly and one of the things that has dated the worst is the special effects with the one exception of the flying missiles which were obviously fake but still impressive for The colored contact lens at the beginning of the film was totally without effect and the laser watch was one of the worst things in the entire movie second only to those damn sharks . Evidently Fatima Blush put some sort of device on his scuba tank that attracted sharks they did have weird guiding mechanisms of their own in a scene that more than likely inspired the classic line have one simple request . And that is to have sharks with FRICKIN laser beams attached to their heads ! And then of course there is the exploding hotel room scene which was redone in an episode of The Simpsons and which was obviously followed by another obligatory and overly casual one from James . The domination video game created by Largo the film's villain is an especially memorable scene and the film also boasts what is probably the best motorcycle chase in the entire series to superior to the laughable one in Tomorrow Never Dies But despite many strengths the film's weaknesses are left clearer in the audience's mind at the end of the film due in large part to the anticlimactic underwater conclusion of the more obvious parts borrowed from Thunderball and inferiorly recreated Never mind the fact that Largo revealed some crucial information to Bond as he left him in the tower alive Evil's brilliance once again just leave him there without actually witnessing his death and just assume everything went to plan . What ? the climax of what is expected to be a fast action film should never take place in a muted underwater atmosphere . All in all Never Say Never Again ranks very highly on the James Bond scale and Connery's wink at the end of the film well as the two closing lines suggested at the time that he may still return for another turn as Bond . Clearly this is no longer very likely so we can only hope .,1,0,0.9221041884712552,0.0778958115287446

The plot is flimsy at best as several plot holes occur throughout . However this normally should n't matter as the comedy should carry a film like this . There are some genuinely funny bits provided by Dylan Moran However other times there are long melodramatic scenes that fail to add anything to the movie . Caine's character seemed overdone to me . Especially at the start he continually quotes Shakespeare and acts like a pompous actor . One could say he was playing the part properly but the character seemed to me flat and unfunny . Overall would say see only if a fan of the actors involved . Otherwise wait for video or tv .,1,0,0.922051604766569,0.0779483952334309
11882_10.txt, better first low last low whole own third bad serious first scary bad more different little special frozen different least last disappointed good, This movie would had worked much better if this was the first Critters movie this is a low movie with only two Critters shown on Why this looks like a fail is because this is the last Critters movie and it's so low that it seems the director made the whole movie with his own pocket money . However did like this movie compare it mostly with the third movie were bad Critters have a more serious tone in it the first half of the movie without seeing one Critter yet you have a scary feeling watching it too bad they did n't milk'' out the Critters mean even if they only had two puppets they could still have used them on a lot more . The Critters also have different deaths in this movie which made this a little special especially at the end with the frozen Critter . Ug has a promotion in this part and is different in this movie which took me by surprise . Lastly liked this one because it also has some kind of conclusion to the series so at least we wo n't see a Critters anymore . Oh one last thing missed one scene in this movie we never see a Critter shoot a spike from its back maybe these puppets did n't have that feature but was very disappointed not seeing that Critters we see a lot of spike shooting which was the only good thing liked about that movie,1,0,0.916298368374323,0.083701631625677

Corey Haim is the boy Barbara Williams is his mother Michael Ironside is one of the evil government guys and Sandy the dog is well the dog Furface here Einstein in the book The monster effects are ridiculously cheesy much of the dialogue is laughable the script rarely makes sense or is believable a good example is Haim's character's unquestioning acceptance of the dog's intelligence as if every Fido off the street can type messages on a computer keyboard or bark once for yes and twice for no ! Hmm it's got ta be the puppy chow right ? Haim's performance is enthusiastic but shaky as he carries off the stupid dialogue with the least amount of skill . Ironside has been the highlight of many a bad movie and this is no exception . He easily gives the best performance of the movie although I'm compelled to add that the dog a pretty darn good actor himself ! comes in a close second .

We want to see cameo roles in Sam Raimi movies and we want to see with the Screaming Brain With the title alone one knows that it's going to border that completely silly type of movie like Army of Darkness only with more silly and less monsters . The idea of the movie is simple . Bruce sees doctor . Doctor has new idea . Bruce gets bad things happen to him on way to see doctor . Coincidentally it's the thing the doctor wanted to show him that saves him . Hilarity ensues .

First of all there's the music . It's just plain awful . There are only songs in the movie most of them used more than once . The opening song is shrieked by a chorus of annoying children and the disco title track is performed by Rick Dees . It does n't get any worse than that . Even the background music is terrible with much of it repeating the themes of the other nauseating tunes . We also get some truly lame slapstick mostly in the opening credits . On the other hand Bill Murray is spot on brilliant as usual . have to wonder if he ad the whole thing or if the writers just gave him all the funny lines . Or maybe he's just that great turning a weak script into comic genius . The best part are his surreal PA announcements . out of here . a menace ! You also get a lot more character development than you have any right to expect in a movie like this . At least half the characters seem like real people . mostly real people you would like to have around . Even Spaz'' gets to do a more than any other Eddie Deezen character ever did and when he gets the girl it's plausible . not absurdly hot but he does n't automatically pair up with one of the nerd girls see Revenge Of The Nerds'' for examples of both cinematic phenomenons . And when the plot seems clich ya got ta wonder if it was n't a clich yet when they made this . While it was n't the first summer camp movie ya got ta go back at least to The Parent Trap'' it's certainly the movie that made it it's own genre . In fact was surprised that there was no Talent Show scene . Hot American Summer'' spoofed the summer genre so perfectly just assumed everything in it came straight out of Meatballs . also half Jon Cryer to pull up in a convertible with a chimp thanks to Mr. Show's'' epic camp spoof Monk Academy'' Anyway this one seems to be vanishing a little as far as the late comedies it's not a cable staple anymore and certainly does n't have the cult following of Caddyshack or Animal House . was pleased to catch it on Showtime today and in High Definition at that !

Her real ambition is to marry Eddie and have a baby . April Baker is too innocent to stay that way for long and falls in love too easily a dangerous combo . Greg Parker is a go and wants to be an actress . All three are doomed for dramatics in Best of Everything a soap opera play solid movie that is aging by the second . Set in the cut world of paperback publishing its not as trashy as Valley of the Dolls'' but not as vanilla as Three Coins in the Fountain . The men in the mix Brian Aherne Stephen Boyd Louis Jourdan and Robert Evans are slick well and no good for the most part . Aherne is the resident sexual offender will pinch anything walking by and makes unwanted advances right and left . His character is offensive as hell but its not played seriously at all . Harassment had n't been discovered yet guess . Boyd works there too although you never see him actually doing anything . He's too busy being older wiser and drunker . Evans is abroad just so Diane Baker can suffer in style he's a rich kid who's gotten her in so instead of marrying her as promised he's taking her to get an Jourdan is a director who mistakenly has an affair with Parker . They share a fight scene which is fairly no barred in a movie like this anyway but the scene is ultimately ruined by Parker's histronics . She ends up nearly stalking him and she really did n't deserve such a lousy fate her bad acting notwithstanding . Joan Crawford breathes fire as Amanda Farrow the resident who is automatically rude and dismissive of any of her legion of secretaries . Well they are younger are n't they ? Is n't that sufficient reason to hate a person ? Caroline does n't think so as she admirably stands up to Miss Farrow every chance she gets . Crawford only gets to let loose once when she tells her married boyfriend can your rabbit wife can both go to hell and slams down the phone . You never get to see the poor soul who dare crosses her . Martha Hyer's as it were is extremely weak and she is painfully over as an unmarried mother . Short of wearing a huge on her cardigan she walks around like a pathetic mess for most of her screen time . Even worse she is not given the courtesy of having it all up one way or the other at the end . It wo n't matter that much but still . Its painfully obvious this all took place in a totally different world . People were nicer to one another for the most part and work was not a drag but something exciting for a girl from outside NYC anyway . One unconvincing drunk scene aside Hope Lange helps it seem reasonably real as Caroline who at least has more than one side to her character . admire that women are seen having an opinion a chance and a choice .

Do n't get me wrong have long forgotten the main story line the relationship between Kidman and Law that made no impression on me but it was the torture scenes in the film that really struck me . cried for about two hours straight after wards . It had never previously occurred to me how people in war time could take advantage of something as pure as a mother's love . We see several examples of this here in both the scenes with Natalie Portman and with the mother with her fingers in the fence for keeping her son hidden at home . was shocked at these scenes and will probably never watch the film again as a consequence because the scenes even now are perfectly clear in my mind . However am glad watched the film simply because it has made me more aware to the horrors of war and the horrible cruelty that mankind can inflict on it's own . The blonde albino character has been top of my list of most evil bad guy ever since saw the film . His horrible sneer and lack of any human feeling for the people he tortured really hit a nerve with me . At one point wanted to get up in the cinema and kill him myself the movie pushed me over the edge of reason only occurred to me afterward that I'd only be hitting a big screen that shows the film's power and intensity at least recommend the film for it's sheer experience not for the entwined love story but for the manner in which it depicts war without needing a battlefield .,1,0,0.9395325593587276,0.0604674406412722

This is the only film that I've seen that seems to have actually captured how bad things were in the war between Russia and Germany . What really liked about it is that the two ideologies and Communism were nowhere in the film . Unlike most American films the Germans are not seen as blood thirsty murderers but what the average German foot soldier was a person . The film revolves around four soldiers fighting in Stalingrad . They were transferred there to try and take the city . The film follows these men from August of to early During this time they learn about the horrors of war and try to find a way out of the battle . Through the entire film one feels the desperation of the entire battle . Unlike Enemy at the Gates'' the film makers did n't try to put some sappy love story or dress up factual occurrences of the battle .

The grotesque visions hallucinations dreams continue begin to affect his mental state Fulci decides to seek help contacts Professor Egon Schwarz Thompson for psychiatric help . Schwarz claims that Fulci can not separate fantasy from reality agrees to help him however Schwarz has a more sinister ulterior motive as a serial killer starts to brutally kill prostitutes Fulci thinks he might be responsible . This Italian production was co directed by Lucio Fulci who also stars in the film as a horror film director named Lucio Fulci which does n't really feel like a lot of effort went into it anyway Un Gatto nel Cervello is gory if nothing else for that alone rather liked it . The script by Fulci John Fitzsimmons Giovanni Simonelli Antonio Tentori is nothing more than a threadbare excuse to edit together lots of gory footage from other Italian films . It serves it's purpose well enough suppose to see Fulci on screen has a certain fascination if your a fan of his or are familiar with his films the ending is very rushed almost as if they ran out of money as it just has a policeman telling Fulci they killed the killer that's it . Another thing about that ending when the two cops put the white sheet over the dead killer in the field then they walk away leaving it there without any other police presence mean would the police in Italy just leave a dead body in the middle of a field on it's own ? It moves along at a good pace if you like your gore then you have to see this although if you do n't like gore then you'll hate it with a passion it all depends on your disposition so the choice folks is yours . Director Fulci was never the most artistically adept filmmaker it shows here as his footage is bland flat looks like it was shot for TV the footage from the other films in total does n't match the stuff Fulci shot it is obvious that this has been pieced together from different films . If your looking for gore you've hit the jackpot people are dismembered with chainsaws put through meat grinders faces are melted there are a few decapitations there are some slit throats someones body is gorily crushed under a car a tongue is ripped out someone has their throat crushed as a wheelchair runs over it there are loads of stabbings someone has their guts removed with a hook there's a rotten corpse complete with maggots someone hand is cut off someone has their head bashed in their eye falls out a gory death by piano wire as it slices through someones throat there are loads of severed limbs gallons of blood splashed around a scene of some cats eating brains there's more as well . Having said that some of the special effects are a bit fake look cheesy . With a supposed budget of around it shows this is pretty cheap looking it has no visual style or artistic merit but then again why would you want those when you can see a Nazi orgy sequence wall gore ? The acting in this is terrible including Fulci . Un Gatto nel Cervello is a top film if your a gore like me however if your looking for something with a little bit more substance or indeed any substance then this ones not for you . This is the sort of film which divides people straight down the middle you'll either love what it does or hate it .,1,0,0.9341085501864932,0.0658914498135067

10391_9.txt, first last favorite least wim many major entire dedicated little himmel need sure malkovich pretentious empty good real whole careful pretentious easy mental only genuine authentic banal slow only other obvious thorough autonomous least intellectual artistic much, saw this film for the first time last night . have been thinking about it all night and this morning . can not say that it was my favorite film at least not yet . need to see it again . The cinematography is stunning . Each shot has a lyricism that one would expect in a film that has Wim Wenders's name attached to it . It is always tempting to see de Chirico in any picture of rows of orders vanishing into the gloom but in this case the analogy fits . In many ways the figure of Malkovich walking through the fog and wind of Ferarra echoes the shadow of the off statue that haunts Milan in the major works of the Italo painter . He is slightly menacing a presence who watches and in his capacity as a film director exerts influence on the entire story . The dedicated Wenders fan can not help but think a little bit of Damiel and Cassiel wandering through the streets of Berlin watching all but not directly interacting with the inhabitants . And following the Himmel Uber Berlin metaphor the angel in this case Malkovich the Director gets to interact with one of the stories . At this point have to bow out of taking this line of criticism too far . need to see the movie again . am fairly sure that this is the thread that will bring Malkovich's monologue together . Perhaps his musings and pontifications are pretentious empty dialog that sound good but can not possibly be parsed into real communication . Maybe that is the whole point of it . No one can make that judgment with any degree of certainty or authority until having done his homework . We must be careful when throwing around the word pretentious . It is easy to write off anything that smacks of the intellect as pretension but that leads to a terrifying mental state one in which the only conversation seen as genuine earthy or authentic is the most banal . When we shun all discussions of philosophy God existence meaning and all that brain candy we are setting our culture up to die a slow stupid and ugly death . Perhaps this is the warning that Wenders and Antonioni are giving us . It certainly is not the only theme of the film but think that it can not be ignored . The other most obvious leitmotif is that of satisfaction . There is a lot here on that and a thorough review of all the subtleties and consequences of the development of this leitmotif would well exceed the word limit for this review . My advice is to see the film . But offer a caveat it is not an autonomous film least do n't think so yet Some films interact with the intellectual and artistic thinking of their times so much that the viewer needs to have a background in the Zeitgeist before approaching the film . Par les nuages is one of those films .,1,0,0.9161760073830856,0.0838239926169143

The dog's best friend'' an American girl named Charlotte by Courtnee Draper whose parents die becomes orphaned by the former Duke due to him being her great uncle . young chef named Florian arrives with him and Charlotte instantly connecting creating a romantic sub which in its own way acts as the under tone for the main plot line being the activities of Hubert The and his many activities and love interests with other dogs . All this is watched over by James Doohan who plays a Butler who is determined to try and serve his old Duke by doing his best to serve his new master Hubert . Doohan acts as the older character there to comfort and advise the younger ones whilst he over looks and performs various ridiculous tasks under his new master . fine comedic performance mixed with elements of drama to end the career of a fine and influential actor . Though from the technical viewpoint dislike this film as only watched upon discovering James Doohan's role . Though the plot is good elements of the writing and directing have to be obscured . Ignoring the absurdity of a Doggie Duke'' personally dislike the over use of comedic and outrageous jokes upon the characters due to their ludicrousness . The dependence on hygiene related humour as you like is much too apparent and general silliness of many characters does n't appeal to me . The director Phillip Spink uses mid shots too often with either an overdubbed voice or affecting the overall sound quality . Plus the acting of Muirhead and Heyman whilst good at the dramatic and romantic sequences fall drastically short fulfilling the wholesale requirements regarding the role . But as a mature movie fan find it easy to be over critical of a simple family film designed to make you laugh . can admit found certain bits funny and other bits touching along with a plot that may be far but has definite connections . do not recommend this film to mature movie fans but do highly recommend it to Dog lovers families who wish to enjoy a funny film for their child and James Doohan fans who wish to see in his final role .,0,1,0.06238540130566,0.93761459869434

Even if the movie did not go in the same direction as the book at least they could of made the romance between these two characters feel more intense . think both Diane Lane and Richard Gere were perfect for these two characters and they have good chemistry however they just did not develop a long enough storyline for us to see how they longed for each other .

And know most of the songs sometimes singing them spontaneously with a crowd or humming them alone . In a real'' musical as differentiated from this vaudeville show every song is painstakingly crafted to fit the exact moment . It is an expression of sadness regret love joy or exaltation natural extension where mere words fail . So in Guys and Dolls My Time of Day'' describes the adventurous life of Sky Masterson as it is about to be compromised by the most unlikely woman . Every song in this brilliant exemplar of the genre sets a mood or develops a character creating a phantasmagoria of place turned absolutely believable by the self disclosing evocations of song . For this lover of the Broadway Musical and their adaptations to the screen during the last half of the century Mama Mia is somewhere between satire and a cruel fun house distortion of the genre . There the songs of these musicals advanced the often elaborate often delightful plot lines . While here the songs simply picked up from a collection only interfered with the shaky premise of the film . Perhaps most of those viewers who are making this film into a monumental success simply have no exposure to the art form of century Musicals . They have no idea of the magic performed by writer and lyricist that can turn a dance hall floozy into someone whom we know and love as achieved in Sweet Charity . Let me offer an apology for the arrogance of this review . Perhaps another day another mood could have gotten into it and not have been so critical in this review . But ca n't help but imagining what Richard Roger Oscar Hammerstein Cole Porter Irving Berlin and so many others could have done even with with this silly premise . think about it while the memories of seeing this film is fresh and can not help but to mourn the great loss .,0,1,0.0400509789853067,0.9599490210146931

After years of anticipation they gave November release date . Well November came . And went . Followed by December . Oh look today's January No US release as of yet . Oh well I'm so glad had a friend with a bootlegged subtitled copy . Well the cg was great . Not as good as expected but near perfect . cringed however at the unnatural movements made by the children throughout the movie . had thought that we were passed this by now . Also did n't really care for the anime look given to their faces . was under the impression that they were shooting for a realistic look to the film and yet most of the characters have larger eyes especially the girl characters . They had personality though I'll give them that . Even though I'm not a big fan of anime do have to say was impressed with the wild fight scenes . They were animated beautifully and had me hanging onto the edge of my seat . For about the first two . And there lies Advent Children's biggest flaw . It's mostly just a bunch of hyper fight scenes . FF sequel of epic proportions had been promised for years . Instead they gave us a pretty piece of cg with barely a plot to excuse it's just running time . Where Final Fantasy is famous for its intricate stories this movie falls short . You do n't really get to know the characters . The only way you'd have any understanding of most of what occurred in the film would have been if you had played the game . We barely got to see them before they were battling it out with whatever current threat . What hurts the fans even more is the awful cameos that the majority of FF characters were given . They were nothing more than Cloud's I'll call if need you but probably wo n't'' back up singers . And to add to the hurt they had each character individually throw Cloud higher and higher . This little part here was so cheesy almost turned it off . would have been much more impressed if he had just simply jumped up all on his own ricocheting off of walls to get himself up higher . It hurt even more when they reduced the Turks to less comic relief . That was fine for the game but this is cinema . People do not act like cartoon characters in a harsh battle . They took away their dignity And spoiler right most of you probably already know anyhow Who remembers Darth Maul being hyped up in SW Episode Yeah now picture that but with Sephiroth . That's right . He had maybe minutes of screen time . Maybe that . End Spoiler If this movie was made for the fans then way to go Square . If this is any indication of the direction you're taking the FF series doubt you're going to be seeing much of my money . played your games for the wonderful story and the excellent characters . You had a chance to make something epic . Something truly beautiful a masterpiece that flies in the face of all of the Disney CG films . Instead you gave us a pretty piece of flesh with hardly anything underneath to hold it together . Way to go . And I'm sure if the rest of the fans paused for a moment and tried to just pay attention to everything but the CG they'd know what I'm talking about . Well was gon na rate this a but after thinking about it while righting this I'm giving it a because they could have done better . They have done better . And this is just sad .

That should have been at the end of the film or located in a special feature .

Black Sabbath returns to the stage after a long hiatus without Osbourne and this film captures that well Sabbath basically rocks the fans . The fans of course have a sweet advantage in the film because they are seeing the band live of course but also they do not have to put up with the incessant interviews that the DVD viewers are burdened with .

The problem is that it is not a very good movie . The films premise is simple . Nine convicts escape a prison after the tenth one goes crazy and tells them where the treasure is . The first half has a lot of slapstick some of it very broad while the second half is a character driven descent into fantasy and melancholy . The two halves simply do n't mix . Individual scenes do work very well guys crashing a friends house who has a new Filipino bride is hilarious While a later scene with the big guy working in the restaurant tugs at the heartstrings . They simply do n't mesh with each other . The movie as well is missing entire set One scene shows the guys desperately looking for change under a deserted vending machine to buy a snack . The very next scene has the whole crew in drag sitting down in a restaurant . Where did they get the dresses and wigs ? crew includes both the big guy and a midget How did they get all the clothes and money to buy the meal ? And most puzzling is why are they in drag ? They are clearly guys in drag and lets face it is there anything more memorable to witnesses than a big guy and a dwarf eating a meal dressed as women ? mention the big guy and the dwarf because besides the old guy everyone else seems to blend into each other . fact they wear matching white jumpsuits throughout most of the movie The movie has very little character development in the first half and as a result the second half really lacks an emotional punch . As we are often trying to figure out who is who in their individual payoff scenes . Speaking of a drag the second half has all those wonderful sweeping camera shots and big emotional moments and great symbolism that makes a great film . It is also excruciatingly slow which makes for a boring movie .

One can argue whether this is true or not . But even if you accept this as true the movie's ending either disputes this by saying there can be some good in tragic situations or forgets this and uses a cliched montage in order to leave the audience feeling uplifted . That the movie metaphorically acquits its protagonist by presenting him as a sympathetic character despite any evidence for that sympathy shows contempt for the supporting characters who were the most compelling in the film .

The leader of the Haka is usually the member of the team with the best Maori pedigree . This is one of the most important conventions of the modern game and has been misused and represented by the writer . The film itself is quite well directed however it is the poor script and over execution that lets it down heavily . Taking into account is is based on a real story it does posses a great deal of clich in the storyline . would strongly suggest that any American interested in rugby watch this film then watch what rugby actually is on Youtube because the rugby portrayed in this film has been distorted and skewed so far from what it really is .,0,1,0.0982643545030091,0.9017356454969908

First of all the plot is as you'd expect it from your average gangster biography nothing new nothing fancy in it . The way it is told makes the movie look a LOT longer than it is thought the two hours should be almost over was quite surprised that only minutes had passed The action scenes look a lot like those from TV series the for example . It's just that in the with the those scenes were far more sophisticated than those in El Padrino'' It's especially fun to see the guys point their guns in the air and still hit something to talk about people that take cover behind car doors which later look like they've been shot through The acting fits quite nicely to the action . Either you get the same reaction to everything that happens Lundgren style or it's so overacted that you may think it's a parody unfortunately it's not My advise is to stay away from this movie any other gangster movie is better than this one .,0,1,0.0855509350417274,0.9144490649582726

It was the world premiere of it in the tiny cinema in the Triskel Arts Centre as part of the Cork Film Festival . found Strange Fruit'' to be an excellent movie . It is a bit rough around the edges but for a low movie that is to be expected ! In general the acting from the main lead Kent Faulcon is wonderful the cinematography and direction excellent and the script hugely entertaining and thought with some nice set and witty dialogue . The ending was a bit sudden with no conclusion given to characters and events once the finale came to its gripping end but perhaps that's what the filmmakers were going for ? It certainly did make the movie more unsettling . did like the fact that the main character never came to terms with his mother on screen it leaves you wondering whether or not he ever will as in real sometimes these things are never settled . This was a good choice to leave it unresolved rather than sentimentally wrapping it up ! Taut and suspenseful throughout Strange Fruit'' is a hugely ambitious debut and have high hopes for what the writer Kyle Schickner will unleash next .

The most beautiful part of this movie is the humans themselves . The people in the choir who are aged from to all have unique colorful lives and are very enjoyable beings . They are characterised by the harsh climate and the recession of the North and have adapted to the way of living required . Throughout the movie we learn a bit about many people in the choir and we follow them through songs some events in a church and on the harbour and in the end a trip to Murmansk . The outside environment filmed in the movie is very beautiful and characterised by the Norwegian nature . The scenography is also natural and taken directly from the choir and from the peoples lives that we meet . Thei livingrooms the bathroom the kettle on the oven there is nothing artificial about this movie not the people not the environment not their music and not their feelings . Everything is as real as can be . It all loses out though when it comes to giving a story . It is very beautiful and real but why do we see it ? Is it because of the songs ? Is it because of the nature ? Or is it simply just to see a story about Berlev Mens about their life and some of the trips they have . The message if there is any is that this small society copes with life through such social events like the choir . The choir have kept the people together for many many years . It is all nice but being as popular as it has been seen by almost in Norway there is something wrong . There is no beginning or end to it . Nobody gains or loses anything nobody reveals any message or tries to convince the audience of that this is good or that life up there is great . Why was this movie made ? am sorry . It is a nice movie about good people but compared to the average European Scandinavian or Norwegian movie this does not deserve a out of It is closer to out of and that is what will give it . If you see this movie in a theater you should expect the average age on the audience to be around It has reported to be consistently high in all theaters . Maybe this is also the reason for it receiving such very high praise in the news and good grades also on the IMDB It is a movie about elders for elders . It is a movie of regret nothing in my life'' and a story saying that living in a small town like Berlev might be a nice life too .,0,1,0.077585059703608,0.922414940296392

Joining the Lethal Weapon'' star are Glenn Close Big Chill'' Paul Scofield Man For All Seasons'' Alan Bates Ian Holm Michael Maloney would be cast as Roderigo opposite Kenneth Branagh and Laurence Fishburne in Oliver Parker's Othello'' my review of Olivier's stage'' version of the tragedy though he only starred in it and who Branagh would cast as Laertes in HIS version of Hamlet'' proper homage to Sir Laurence Olivier and his classic version of the play see my review on that one as well years later Nathaniel Parker would be cast as Cassio in his brother's version of Othello'' years later and Helena Bonham who would be cast in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein'' years later . Zeffirelli intended this movie as a homage to Sir Laurence Olivier had died years prior to this movie and it works pretty well for the most part . What was slightly uncomfortable with was Zeffirelli's misplacing a lot of lines and in one scene he gives one of Hamlet's lines to the Ghost . Also Helena Bonham DID NOT convince me as Ophelia . She was too dull and unreal whereas Jean Simmons had immortalized the role in Olivier's version and Kate Winslet did an acceptable job in Kenneth Branagh's uncut epic revisionist reworking of Hamlet'' were good in the role with Jean Simmons being the BEST Ophelia ever that's why she was nominated for Best Actress in did n't win a shame Ian Holm said his lines too quickly not slowly as expected him to in a scene with him Laertes and Ophelia . But then again I'm more used to Felix Aylmer and Richard Briers interpretations of the role and think that they did better jobs than Holm in their respective versions of Hamlet'' done by great directors actors text producers AND stars of all their versions of the Bard's work as Polonius . The rest of the cast however was excellent . The scene where Hamlet confronts his mother was very well done but Olivier and Branagh heightened the scene to better lengths to create even more emotional intensity and suspense that the scene required . recommend this version just to pass the time but it's ideal as a teaching tool for English teachers recommend showing Olivier's version first then Branagh's and finally this version Despite the film's PG'' rating there was really nothing objectionable in the movie . Only what the play called for . The Best Versions Of Hamlet'' Are Sir Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh . Both were so good that ca n't decide which one was the best . See my reviews on these versions for more information . Franco Zeffirelli . This one was alright . It started out alright with a scene not in the play but should've then progressed to the actual beginning of the play where a guard cries out Who's there ? Nay answer me . Stand and unfold yourself ! That scene scares the hell out of you because you're sitting quietly and then you almost jump out of your skin . In short that scene sets the tone for the rest of the play . HUGE blunder on Zeffirelli's part to omit that scene . It also misplaced a lot of lines cut others that think should've been put in such as the line where Hamlet says to Ophelia Get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners ? that line was supposed to have occurred in THAT scene NOT where it was placed in the film the To Be Or Not To Be'' soliloquy . This version struggles between cutting out too much or too little from an excellent piece of literature . Kenneth Branagh would remedy that years later with his uncut version of the tragedy making HIS version a more fitting homage to Sir Laurence Olivier as several of the actors from him had performed Hamlet'' on stage on film many times on different occasions . However Zeffirelli's take on Hamlet'' IS faithful to the play and THAT's what was looking for . The setup for the final act duel was the same as in Olivier and Branagh's versions only that the denouement in Branagh's version was more violent than the denouement of the previous two faithful versions in line with the play Olivier toned it down . it worked equally well and stuck more closely to the play with Branagh throwing in a few harmless touches of his own . very good effect .

1254_2.txt, great little shocked last much major intriguing burnt brilliant real excessive much personal exorbitant incredible excellent, Having just finished reading the book One of a Kind'' a week ago was thinking This would make a great movie especially now when people know a little about poker and poker players'' was totally shocked to find it while browsing at the video store last night . had no idea someone had actually turned this into a film . grabbed it immediately and watched with much anticipation . What a major letdown ! All of the intriguing things about Stu Ungar were skimmed over quickly and instead was left with a biopic that could have been about anybody . Ungar may have been a burnt jerk but he was also a brilliant thinker that could read people instinctively . That is what made him so fascinating . Why not focus on that ? And talk about watering down the real truth . This guy was excessive about absolutely everything drugs women gambling starvation sleep He gambled on sporting events from dusk to dawn he would go missing for days while hanging out in crack dens his body was perpetually emaciated and yet if he ever needed money he could always beat just about anyone at will playing cards . Now that's a story ! Too much time spent on his childhood and personal relationships his ties with Vincent'' and his daughter were hardly touched on and hardly anything about his drugs use was exorbitant his insane gambling and his incredible card abilities . Probably too late now but hope someone remakes this film properly . had no problem with Imperioli . He is excellent . The script just left him with nothing interesting to say .,0,1,0.08634908110539,0.91365091889461

He has had a steady string of appearances before he burst back on the scene . He was memorable in Domino Sin City Man on Fire Once Upon a Time in Mexico and Get Carter . But in his powerful dramatic performance in The Wrestler we see a full blown presentation of the character only hinted at in Get Carter . Whenever we get to know him Rourke remains a cool but sleazy muscle bound slim ball . This is an Elmore Leonard story and production . Leonard wrote such notable movies as taunt western thriller to Yuma Be Cool Jackie Brown Get Shorty Pick and Joe Kidd . This means that we get tough guys some good some not so good . It also means we get tight realistic plots with characters doing what is best for them in each situation weaving complications into violent conclusions . Killshot is no different . Tough slim ball killer Rourke stalks unhappily married witness Lane . Think History of Violence meets No Country for Old Men . It is not as intense bloody or gory as those two but it is almost as good . If you like those two including David Croneberg's equally wonderful Eastern Promises you will like Killshot also . Director John Madden has not done a lot of movies . His last few were enjoyable if not successful Proof Captain Corelli's Mandolin and Shakespeare in Love . Diana Lane has n't had a powerful movie role since she and Richard Gere gave incredible performances in Unfaithful . Lately she is charming and appealing in romantic stories such as Nights in Rodanthe Must Love Dogs and Under the Tuscan Sun . Here she is right on mark balancing her sexy appeal with reserved tension . This is a small part for Rosario Dawson . Yet Dawson does a good job with it . You see a lot more of Lane including an underwear scene to rival Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut . While you are in the crime drama section also pick up Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Gone Baby Gone and Before the Devil Knows Your Dead . The last has wonderful performances by Phillip Seymour Hoffman Ethan Hawke Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney . Killshot flopped at the box office . More is our luck . It is certainly worth a dollar rental if you like this genre .,0,1,0.0196609030001219,0.980339096999878
11653_3.txt, fair great interesting stunning spectacular beautiful several wonderful better hysterical wonderful mary great animated notre interesting best great most character greatest funny hysterical entire funny comic least single live flynn priceless good whole good hysterical smile awful accurate easier funny true mary n able good clean vulgar offensive, Based on the comments made so far everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it . think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a GREAT movie it has its interesting moments . For one thing it was filmed on location in Colorado it Breckinridge or Telluride ? ca n't remember but it is in the credits The location is absolutely stunning and spectacular . It's beautiful even to me who lived in Colorado for several years . Next it has Disney's penchant for wonderful character actors . Harry Morgan has never been in better form than when he plays in a Disney movie . He is literally hysterical . Also remember the wonderful Mary Wickes ? Although she has a bit part'' in this movie she is great as always . If you do n't know who she is think of the animated Disney version of Hunchback from Notre Dame was one of the gargoyles and she was also the most interesting nun in Sister Act'' as well as the best nun in The Trouble With Angels . She has always been a great character actress and most character actors never receive the recognition they deserve . In addition to character actors and all casts in the Disney may have not had the greatest'' movies but if you really watch some of them from beginning to end you will NOTICE that every movie has some really funny or hysterical moment in it . The entire movie may not be funny but there is always a comic gem least or in every single live movie Disney ever made . Whether it's Harry Morgan in one of his bellowing tones of voice or Tim Conway floundering around or Joe Flynn giving one of his priceless looks of horror it is all good . The whole film may not be good but there are ALWAYS hysterical moments in every Disney film from this period that have ever seen . Disney in this time period always managed to make a person smile despite the dumbness of the film . Bsed on these comments disagree with viewers who say every Disney movie in this time period is awful . That statement it not quite accurate . Rather it is easier for me to give credit to the funny moments and overlook the weaknesses in the plots . Some live Disney movies are true classics Yeller Bedknobs and Broomsticks Mary Poppins but for those that are n't am able to appreciate them for what they were good clean family fun in a time when movies had become vulgar crude and offensive .,0,1,0.0550101791475906,0.9449898208524092

Once you subtract all of the plot ripped off from The Core'' basically the manned drilling machine you end up with the plot of Crack in the World'' Crack'' was a truly excellent movie starring Dana Andrews . His team of scientists working in South Africa drilled down to the crust and punched through'' with a nuclear device in order to provide a steady source of geothermic energy . One of his subordinates also a brilliant scientist disagrees . He believes that the blast will not drill a simple hole but will instead form cracks in the crust . spoiler He is right . In order to stop the resultant crack from destroying the earth they must place another nuclear device in the path of the crack . Although have placed a spoiler warning do n't know if really spoiled anything for either movie .

Smaller planes such as or shuttle passengers between the two cities every half an hour . The drive from the airport home if shown on a map would reveal an intricate zig zag back and forth .

Not that it would be a local habit as myself got ripped off in very serious places such as Switzerland . The girls yes . All topless . That's something an outsider will never understand . Brazilian chicks will be happy to expose of their incredible bodies at the Samba Schools parades and wear almost non bikinis at beach but never go topless . handful beaches across the whole country will allow it . All carefully secluded and out of town . Oh the indoor decoration the amazing wallpaper . maybe in Disneyworld .

It was on ABC's Sunday Afternoon Movie . This was n't a very good movie but for a low budget independent film like this it was okay . There is some suspense in it but there are so many bad qualities that really bring the movie down . The script is pretty lame and the plot elements are n't very realistic such as the way a operator would laugh and hang up when someone is reporting a murder . do n't know what the writer was thinking when they came up with that idea but it is n't very realistic . thought this movie was going to be a good suspense thriller because there were a few scenes that seemed like they would lead to something good but unfortunately they never did . There were a few plot elements that have been used in other movies similar to this and in the end did n't prove to be very creative . If there is something good about this movie it is the cast . Every actor in this movie did good with what they had to work with . The terribly underrated actress Elizabeth Pena was great in this movie . She is very sexy and has an incredibly sexy voice . However if you want to see a movie of hers that is really good watch the excellent animated movie The Incredibles . In that movie she put her sexy voice to good use . What can say this movie is n't really worth your time but the actors were good . Unfortunately they were all wasted on this movie which is a real shame . This movie tried to be a good suspense thriller but in the end it fell flat . If you want to see a good movie that is similar to this but much better see The Hitcher . If you want to see something with the cast members of this movie watch any of their other movies . You can real easily pass on this movie if you ever get the chance to see it .,0,1,0.09641008761666,0.90358991238334
2919_4.txt, n classic good little rainy saturday right american missionary american corrupt political perfect current s underworld current rich n physical silent understated good good racist chinese typical black mean other close lloyd best good enough more, While this is n't an all time classic comedy it is a pretty good little movie to watch if you catch it on a rainy Saturday morning with not a lot else going on right then . Harold Lloyd plays Ezekiel Cobb an American coming home after growing up in China where his dad was a missionary . has come home from China to find an American wife and plans to return to China to continue his father's work . unwittingly is recruited to run for mayor of his corrupt home town when the existing political machine that controls the town realizes that he would make a perfect patsy to run against the current mayor who also is the head of the town's underworld . figure the bumbling Cobb has no chance to win and therefore the current mayor continues to run the town and run his schemes which makes them all rich . Lloyd is n't doing the physical comedy here like he did in his silent films . does a convincing portrayal of Cobb with a reserved understated dignity . acting was good from all involved and the story and script were also quite good . Being made in the film does have some rather racist language when talking about the Chinese and it also has a typical black character from that era but these stereotypes are n't nearly as mean as I've seen from other films from that time . Although not close to being Lloyd's best film movie does entertain and Lloyd is very good as Cobb . wo n't be blown away by this film but it may be enough to peak your interest in Lloyd and make you want to see more of his work .,0,1,0.0937444560418426,0.9062555439581572

563_4.txt, lighthearted s comical first serious marble great great greatest good early dated young many neat more many many real interesting aristotle many incalculable favorite early main easy worth historical olivia funny early i entertaining, This movie should have been called The Eyes of Alexander'' and they should have done away with the Bogart concept altogether . The film started out with a lighthearted approach to Bogart's legacy and some comical moments with his surgery oriented face but after the first minutes it morphs into a more serious thriller where two palm size sapphires purportedly laid as eyes into a marble headpiece of Alexander the Great for him and seen by him right before his death . So the gems are of great value not only because of their quality and size but also because of the tie to the Greatest conquerer the world has ever known . Being an expert on Alexander qualifies me to say that this is wholly and completely a fiction but it makes for a good movie anyway . So the film winds around some early silliness and stumbles along with all sorts of Alexander allusions in both the foreground and background really liked ending with a dated shark attack could n't go to a movie in without some shark showing up to menace the audience There is a yacht named Euridice father's young wife a man named Alexander Philip Cleitus ? been about years since I've seen the film so ca n't remember all the details Olympias some street names and many others . It was fun to watch the film just to try to catch all the background details that the director an Alexanderphile himself put in . When all is said and done the eyes are retrieved and the camera pans in on them on a bed as the credits roll by . Kind of a neat ending . What would have been more fun would be if they went the Indiana Jones way and had an action adventure . There were many many real artifacts that could have been used to make this more interesting or instance the hand Aristotle version of the Iliad that Alexander kept with him all his life even on his many journeys across Asia be of incalculable value if found today Olivia Hussey all time favorite actress killed off way too early and should have been the main actress throughout not the girl from the Momma's and the Poppa's . she was herself easy on the eyes . If you can find this flick it might be worth checking out for the historical stuff and to see Olivia Hussey in an extremely funny deadpan humor bit early on but beyond that I'd pass on it for something more entertaining .
