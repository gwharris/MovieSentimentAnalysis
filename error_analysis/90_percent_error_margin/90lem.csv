1376_8.txt, wa having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me and could n put it down until the end and had forgotten about my horrid day and the ending by the way where is the sequel the budget is obviously extremely low but look what they did with it it reminds me of a play they are basically working with a tent a pod a few gun uniform camping gear and a thing that is it for prop maybe this is even a good thing forcing the acting and writing to have to step up and take their rightful place in film a the center of the work instead of a afterthought used to have an excuse to make cgi fight the cgi is fine it is not exactly but imho it still work why because there is n too much of it and what there is is not over with an army of effect house people trying to cram everything they can into the shot it prompt the imagination it s some relatively simple stuff with decent composition the heavy freighter shot there is one long shot that must be at least ten second track the entire length of the ship it must be a record for sci fi battle sequence film making in the past year to have an action sequence that last longer than second and some relation to the story it might look old or not of the art but it doe n look stupid and it doe n take away from the story the acting is good except the character die too fast to get to know them the captain wa great but a few of his scene could have used another take also got confused with his character losing his cool and stomping on a corpse like to think captain are calm cool and in control what wa going on in that scene did the other crew worry about him losing it at that moment did he feel himself losing control now a for the plot mostly it is good why because it doe n try to explain itself it just happens it s called planet it a mystery get it nobody know why there is a statue and they do n find out either the mysterious cult the weird scientist with the tattoo what do you expect to find out in le than minute this is n war and peace and thank god it s not star war either no midichlorians no minute of expository boring dialog that ha no purpose in the story the character are stranded and are only able to figure out a few basic thing it is not a star trek episode where they find out it s leonardo davinci or a child like space wanderer it is mysterious and liked that do n know why maybe can identify with these guy more since they do n know whats happening and do n either they do n talk a lot of space gibberish or have magic box telling them what is happening in fact would argue that one of the weakest moment is when the turn on the crew and try to the reason for the planet the cult etc this coincidentally ha some of the weakest dialog imho in the whole movie and it interrupt the flow and some of the character look unnatural in that scene ok sometimes felt it wa a little too mysterious though like why did the guy get fried through his eye with lightning that wa odd just weird the ending again would have liked to have known some of these character better and would it have been so hard to have a second rescue scene at the end this is not a serial show it wa a film and we like closure in film even if they can have a sequel imagine hamlet with no of angel sing thee to thy rest anyways what can say this wa well worth the dollar payed at the box machine at the supermarket it wa also imho a better piece of storytelling than starwars part or like said it sucked me in wanting to know what wa happening and could n stop watching until the end, was having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me and could n't put it down until the end . and had forgotten about my horrid day . and the ending . by the way . where is the sequel ! the budget is obviously extremely low . but look what they did with it ! it reminds me of a play . they are basically working with a tent a pod a few guns uniforms camping gear and a thing . that is it for props . Maybe this is even a good thing forcing the acting and writing to have to step up and take their rightful place in film as the centers of the work instead of as afterthoughts used to have an excuse to make CGI fights The cgi is fine . It is not exactly but imho it still works . why ? because there is n't too much of it and what there is is not over with an army of effects house people trying to cram everything they can into the shot . it prompts the imagination . it's some relatively simple stuff with decent composition the heavy freighter shot . there is one long shot that must be at least ten seconds . tracks the entire length of the ship . it must be a record for sci fi battle sequence film making in the past years to have an action sequence that lasts longer than seconds and some relation to the story . it might look old or not of the art but it does n't look stupid and it does n't take away from the story . The acting is good except the characters die too fast to get to know them . The captain was great but a few of his scenes could have used another take . also got confused with his character losing his cool and stomping on a corpse like to think captains are calm cool and in control . what was going on in that scene ? did the other crew worry about him losing it at that moment ? did he feel himself losing control ? Now as for the plot . mostly it is good . why ? Because it does n't try to explain itself . It just happens . It's called planet its a mystery get it ? Nobody knows why there is a statue and they do n't find out either . The mysterious cult ? The weird scientist with the tattoo ? What do you expect to find out in less than minutes ? This is n't War and Peace . And thank god it's not star wars either . No midichlorians no minutes of expository boring dialog that has no purpose in the story . The characters are stranded and are only able to figure out a few basic things . it is not a star trek episode where they find out it's leonardo davinci or a child like space wanderer . It is mysterious and liked that . do n't know why maybe can identify with these guys more since they do n't know whats happening and do n't either . they do n't talk a lot of space gibberish or have magic boxes telling them what is happening . In fact would argue that one of the weakest moments is when the turns on the crew and tries to the reason for the planet the cult etc . This coincidentally has some of the weakest dialog imho in the whole movie and it interrupts the flow and some of the characters look unnatural in that scene . OK sometimes felt it was a little too mysterious though . Like why did the guy get fried through his eyes with lightning ? That was odd . Just weird . The ending . again would have liked to have known some of these characters better . And would it have been so hard to have a second rescue scene at the end ? This is not a serial show it was a film and we like closure in films even if they can have a sequel . Imagine Hamlet with no of angels sing thee to thy rest Anyways . What can say . This was well worth the dollar payed at the box machine at the supermarket . It was also imho a better piece of storytelling than starwars parts or Like said it sucked me in wanting to know what was happening and could n't stop watching until the end .,1,0,0.9087985266165652,0.0912014733834346
10581_10.txt, haggard the movie is the real life story of ryan dunn and his girlfriend who cheated on him also with the help from his two friend skate boarder who life for nothing and trying funny scientist doe n really work played by bam margera and brandom dicamillo the film haggard the movie also ha a lot of the character from jackass etc but to say it wa written by bam margera and co this is a very weak attempt seems to me like it wa written when he wa bored or a a project with they did not pay a lot of attention to the film also star bam s girlfriend jennifer rivell who play glauren ryan s girlfriend who basically cheated on him again very bad acting by jennifer another actor that some people may be interested in is steve hellboy played by rakeyohn which his character doe not seem to be with the story again bad acting also this character doe not really have a lot of line in this film which basically make it very boring but worst of all is raab s character the voice sound like a smoker who basically ha throat cancer also think he could have been improved overall think the character in this film are n with the story like in one scene it would be on one certain character a minute later a different scene different character to say that this is supposed to be a film sort of a documentary it not played by the character a a documentary the acting make you think that it a cheap attempt at making a film with your spare time towards the middle of the film we start to lose focus on the main character ryan dunn although a lot of the attention is on bam and brandon in conclusion this film is ok if you laugh at thing that are n very funny stupid stunt terrible acting and the occasional nude scene also think there there are too many scene of just no talking and just music, Haggard The Movie is the real life story of Ryan Dunn and his girlfriend who cheated on him also with the help from his two friend skate boarder who lives for nothing and trying funny scientist does n't really work played by Bam Margera and Brandom Dicamillo . The film Haggard The Movie also has a lot of the characters from Jackass etc but to say it was written by Bam Margera and Co. this is a very weak attempt seems to me like it was written when he was bored or as a project with they did not pay a lot of attention to . The films also stars Bam's girlfriend Jennifer Rivell who plays Glauren Ryan's girlfriend who basically cheated on him again very bad acting by Jennifer another actor that some people may be interested in is Steve Hellboy played by RakeYohn which his character does not seem to be with the story again bad acting also this character does not really have a lot of lines in this film which basically makes it very boring . but worst of all is Raab's character the voice sound like a smoker who basically has throat cancer also think he could have been improved ! Overall think the characters in this film are n't with the story like in one scene it would be on one certain character a minute later a different scene different character . To say that this is supposed to be a film sort of a documentary its not played by the characters as a documentary the acting makes you think that its a cheap attempt at making a film with your spare time . Towards the middle of the film we start to lose focus on the main character Ryan Dunn although a lot of the attention is on Bam and Brandon . In conclusion this film is OK if you laugh at things that are n't very funny stupid stunts terrible acting and the occasional nude scene ! Also think there there are too many scenes of just no talking and just music !,1,0,0.928606436318502,0.0713935636814979

8134_7.txt, this wa laurel and hardy s last silent film for roach studio however since the public had a real thirst for talkie this same short wa re by the team just a few year later with only a few small plot change laughing gravy wa essentially the same plot except that stan and ollie were trying to hide a cute puppy from their grouchy landlord a goat like in angora love this whole goat angle is the worst part of the film while you could understand the boy wanting to keep a cute little dog all it is snowy outside why exactly they bring a goat home is just contrived and pointless according to the plot the goat followed them home and so they got tired of shooing it away and kept it huh this just doe n make any sense it had been a giraffe or a cow would they have done the same thing apart from being an unconvincing plot the movie itself is pure laurel and hardy with a familiar plot and familiar role for the comedian this film feature quite a few laugh but unfortunately is n one of their better film to wrap up their silent career this aspect of their career just seems to have ended with a whimper, This was Laurel and Hardy's last silent film for Roach Studios . However since the public had a real thirst for talkies'' this same short was re by the team just a few years later with only a few small plot changes . LAUGHING GRAVY was essentially the same plot except that Stan and Ollie were trying to hide a cute puppy from their grouchy landlord a goat like in ANGORA LOVE . This whole goat angle is the worst part of the film . While you could understand the boys wanting to keep a cute little dog all it is snowy outside why exactly they bring a goat home is just contrived and pointless . According to the plot the goat followed them home and so they got tired of shooing it away and kept it . Huh ? This just does n't make any sense it had been a giraffe or a cow would they have done the same thing ? Apart from being an unconvincing plot the movie itself is pure Laurel and Hardy with a familiar plot and familiar roles for the comedians . This film features quite a few laughs but unfortunately is n't one of their better films to wrap up their silent careers . This aspect of their careers just seems to have ended with a whimper .,1,0,0.9391320143512631,0.0608679856487368

It does n't look American either there are n't any car chases or shoot or violence unless you consider the killing of a mouse an act of blood or the daily tension of getting by a subdued catastrophe . At times the relatively long medium shots may remind you of Asian cinema but just reminds you the director does n't push things to the radical minimalism of some Taiwanese filmmakers but then again this is not a Taiwanese movie it's a Turkish movie . do n't know what that means do n't even know if that's supposed to mean something . The movie does n't have a plot proper and yet those few lines those somewhat long shots and that often mitigated tension gradually build a sense of something happening a sense of for lack of a better word that grows on you .

For starters Simon Wincer's back a man who's name is synonymous with high TV westerns . Unfortunately the problems with Moon'' are something even the most talented director could n't solve poor script based on a lackluster novel . Forget historical accuracies as any reader of the novels can tell you the biggest travesty in Moon'' is that it's not even consistent with information from the original Lonesome Dove'' masterpiece . So many wonderful rich moments in the miniseries and to an even greater degree the book are completely missing in Moon . Considering the fact that most viewers of Moon'' are probably coming with at least some sort of Dove'' background the lack of character and emotional backstory is downright painful . That said Moon'' is one instance where the adapted version could and should have been altered to make it more suitable for the screen . For example the novel Moon'' focuses largely on the Comanches themselves . To its credit the miniseries tries to service the Comanches but in the end it gives them just enough that the viewer just gets a sense they're missing out on some important part of the story . Similarly Val Kilmer's Scull loses out here too the role should have either been expanded so Kilmer Rachel Griffiths for that matter actually had something to do or the roles should have just been reduced to smaller supporting parts . Instead Kilmer gets top billing for a character that just leaves you scratching your head after his appearance in the completely bizarre final act . There's strange moments throughout the film that just make no sense to those who have n't read the book killer parrot ? what ? further there is n't a single scene that shows us that Call and McCrae are anything near the amazing Texas rangers they claim to be . Not a single one of their expeditions in Moon Dead Man's Walk for that matter ends successfully and Call and McCrae just seem to blunder their way through one pointless mission after another . Frankly Larry McMurtry should never have been given the job of writing the script and only did so because of the praise surrounding that other cowboy movie Brokeback Mountain . McMurtry can write good novels there's some dissension over the consistency of that statement but he's never exactly established himself as a scriptwriter . This production would have benefited from not only bringing back director Wincer but original screenwriter Bill Wittcliff to adapt the novel to screen . Witcliff does n't exactly have a mountainload of material to his screen writing credit but no one can deny he did a fantastic job at whittling down the original Lonesome Dove . With all this said Comanche Moon'' is almost a brilliant production aided by a terrific cast that unfortunately just are n't given enough to do . Steve Zahn's portrayal of Gus McCrae or rather his portrayal of Robert Duvall as Gus McCrae is dead And while some have criticized Karl Urban as Woodrow Call saying his performance does n't imitate the quiet stoic Woodrow of the original movie all can say is blame McMurtry because McMurtry is the one who both in the Moon'' novel and now the miniseries turned Woodrow from socially inept awkward but natural leader into some emotionless character whose lines are just dull and whose character motivations are only clear if you've seen them portrayed far more adequately in the sequel'' Still it's the cast that sparkles in Moon to the degree that left the miniseries with that same feeling of melancholy felt watching the original Lonesome Dove'' this time because realized it's probably the last time we'll see these characters appear on screen for a long long time to come and quite honestly this cast could have done so well in a well full network TV series . All in all aside from wasted opportunities with the cast the biggest travesty is that the original Lonesome Dove novel contained so much rich backstory for the characters that would have been fascinating utterly fascinating to see translated on screen . Unfortunately all that has been tossed aside in favor of McMurtry's tedious inconsistent and ultimately irrelevant prequel .,1,0,0.9452371704999438,0.0547628295000561

Among the flicks we watched the strongest contender quality bad fare was easily Jack It's ludicrous that movies such as Gigli'' Glitter'' and You Got Served'' are listed in IMDBs bottom While they're certainly bad movies they do n't belong in the bottom They're robbing Jack and Keeper of Time'' etc of the Bad Movie Greatness they so richly deserve . So what makes Jack so great bad movie terms For starters Steve Latshaw the director decided to cast his son Ryan Latshaw in the role of Sean Kelly . Unfortunately for Steve Ryan Latshaw was dangerously close to being out by a block of wood . The kid seriously has no ability to emote whatsoever . The end result unintentional comic gold . The kid could be listening to a joke or just moments away from getting his head smashed asunder and his expression is one of stony emotionlessness'' The other aspect of the movie that we found awesome was the sheer number of double dreaming'' sequences . What is a double Well it's when a character wakes up from a nightmare and then something equally nightmarish happens and then the character wakes up again . Basically they wake up after dreaming about waking up from a nightmare . Clever device no ? believe the character of Sean Kelly experienced no less than double sequences . Let's see . what else ? Oh yeah ! This movie has a veritable cast of thousands . It's truly stunning to see how many speaking roles are introduced throughout the course of the movie . Best of all almost none of the characters have anything to do with the story . They're either killed by Jack or they serve no purpose whatsoever . Jack himself was pretty sweet . Like most other monsters Jack has the amazing ability to seemingly teleport over great distances . He's invariably hanging somewhere in the background whenever you're dealing with a major character . What's puzzling however is that when he's actually chasing someone he moves at a shambling speed and yet he's able to keep up with people who are sprinting . That's all for now . Closing remarks if you're looking for a unintentionally hilarious bad movie you ca n't go wrong by renting this beast . Bad Movie Score Good Movie Score,1,0,0.9015016140855144,0.0984983859144856

The grotesque visions hallucinations dreams continue begin to affect his mental state Fulci decides to seek help contacts Professor Egon Schwarz Thompson for psychiatric help . Schwarz claims that Fulci can not separate fantasy from reality agrees to help him however Schwarz has a more sinister ulterior motive as a serial killer starts to brutally kill prostitutes Fulci thinks he might be responsible . This Italian production was co directed by Lucio Fulci who also stars in the film as a horror film director named Lucio Fulci which does n't really feel like a lot of effort went into it anyway Un Gatto nel Cervello is gory if nothing else for that alone rather liked it . The script by Fulci John Fitzsimmons Giovanni Simonelli Antonio Tentori is nothing more than a threadbare excuse to edit together lots of gory footage from other Italian films . It serves it's purpose well enough suppose to see Fulci on screen has a certain fascination if your a fan of his or are familiar with his films the ending is very rushed almost as if they ran out of money as it just has a policeman telling Fulci they killed the killer that's it . Another thing about that ending when the two cops put the white sheet over the dead killer in the field then they walk away leaving it there without any other police presence mean would the police in Italy just leave a dead body in the middle of a field on it's own ? It moves along at a good pace if you like your gore then you have to see this although if you do n't like gore then you'll hate it with a passion it all depends on your disposition so the choice folks is yours . Director Fulci was never the most artistically adept filmmaker it shows here as his footage is bland flat looks like it was shot for TV the footage from the other films in total does n't match the stuff Fulci shot it is obvious that this has been pieced together from different films . If your looking for gore you've hit the jackpot people are dismembered with chainsaws put through meat grinders faces are melted there are a few decapitations there are some slit throats someones body is gorily crushed under a car a tongue is ripped out someone has their throat crushed as a wheelchair runs over it there are loads of stabbings someone has their guts removed with a hook there's a rotten corpse complete with maggots someone hand is cut off someone has their head bashed in their eye falls out a gory death by piano wire as it slices through someones throat there are loads of severed limbs gallons of blood splashed around a scene of some cats eating brains there's more as well . Having said that some of the special effects are a bit fake look cheesy . With a supposed budget of around it shows this is pretty cheap looking it has no visual style or artistic merit but then again why would you want those when you can see a Nazi orgy sequence wall gore ? The acting in this is terrible including Fulci . Un Gatto nel Cervello is a top film if your a gore like me however if your looking for something with a little bit more substance or indeed any substance then this ones not for you . This is the sort of film which divides people straight down the middle you'll either love what it does or hate it .,1,0,0.9129606676796904,0.0870393323203095

Even the promotional posters for the movie had me nervous . In fact if it was n't for the fact that I'd received free tickets to the preview would have resisted the pressure from the missus thinks Mick's a hunk there's a worry to pay money for it . The first few minutes of the movie had me worried it starts with one of Micks tired get angry at insignificant things'' routines but that was given a neat touch which at least made it a little refreshing . The rest of the script was pretty good and very light hearted even the typical Mick Molloy Judith Lucy humour was delivered well and whilst never had to pick myself up from the aisles it generated a lot more chuckles that was expecting it was consistant There's nothing new in the plot pretty predictable but it moved along quickly between one and other jokes never felt it harboured on any element too long or too short Mick must have worked hard on polishing his script . There were a one or two Late Show'' in and one or two jokes that only Melbournians would get but certainly there's plenty of generic stuff in there for a wider audience . Something that found disappointing was the relative unfunnyness of John Clarke he just did n't seem to work as the bad guy but that does n't detract from the movie too much . Over all enjoyed this Australain comedy and was pleasantly entertained for the duration of the movie . left the cinema with a decent sized grin a pretty hard thing for an Australian comedy to do in my books .,1,0,0.9027046391657992,0.0972953608342007

To the guys out there how many of you spend your time jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkey sounds ? To the girls how many of you have suddenly gone from prudes to nymphos overnight not with your husband ? To the French would you really ask about someone being la fac'' when you know they do n't speak French ? Would n't you use a more common word like universit lived in France for a while and sort of do know and understand Europe love it but my roommate and found this pretty insulting overall . It looked like a movie funded by the European Parliament and it tried too hard basically . It had all sorts of differences that it tried to tie together a bad thing in itself but the result is at best awkward but in fact ridiculous many clashes that would n't really happen . Then the end of the movie last minutes all the rest . Why does n't Xavier talk to the Erasmus students he meets back in Paris ? Why does he just walk off ? Why does he just run away from his job is that freedom'' And in the end is the new Europe supposed to rest on bunch of people who smoke up and shag all day ? Is this what it's made up of ? Besides the acting was pretty horrible . ca n't believe Judith Godr role and acting . Why was she made to look like Emanuelle so much ? At first thought Xavier was OK but with retrospect think he was pretty bad . And that's all really too bad because technically credits scenes when he's asking what papers he needs it was really good for sound editing around the British siblings and the soundtrack was great too . So the form was good but the content pretty horrible .,1,0,0.9698853960582966,0.0301146039417033

This movie contains one of the cheesiest scenes have ever seen in my life . Not to mention the really bad gun scenes . When people are shot in this movie blood splatters thick as ketchup all over the place this makes the movie seem so cheap and lame that you just lose interest . constant shaking of the camera is what annoys me the most during the fight This is suppose done to create an action though in my opinion it gives no effect whatsoever . Its completely ridiculous ! All stunt are done extremely badly . a scene where the dead Vampire gets thrown off a roof . When the corpse hits the ground it bounces like a wobbly rubber scene where Jack sniffs the ground getting a vision was so lame it got me laughing hysterically . Lame music cheesy scenes bad acting and plain dumb filming techniques are obviously the functions that make this movie such a malfunction . To state that this is a good movie would be the same as stating that nuclear bombs are good for humans .

The script is not only obvious of the checklist boxes end up being ticked but spends a lot of time trying to create a pastiche of the best of other people's work . The Godfather being the most obvious but there are other references too . wo n't bother naming them . Nevertheless it is a good taste borrower ! The producer seems to set a quota for gunshots and murder at least every twenty minutes ? and the ending is weak and so what ? am told there are various versions of this production so that maybe that is just the version have seen . Gangsters do n't make money they take money . Usually by fear . Some seem more in to the murder and mayhem side of the business than making money . They were the ones that were the first to go real life and here You ca n't make money with a gun in your hand'' says Charlie Luciano at one stage . One of the smarter gangsters although all things are relative . He was a skilled white slave trader and a drug dealer before being bundled home to Italy . The old school moustached Pete's'' were picked off by the new bloods who wanted the power and the money for themselves and to break free of the straight jacket of Italian power doing business outside themselves The young Turk knew they needed to be allied with other groups notably the Jews'' who knew how to launder money and this is at least referenced and acknowledged . What is n't made so clear is that most immigrant groups had their own Mafia's but most of them made their money and went legit . And why not ? Who wants to die in jail ? Joseph Bonanno was a ruthless man prepared to kill if needs be but not an unfair or stupid one . His story was tragic in that he could have made money in the over ground world and he showed a special skill in avoiding getting killed . With a little bit of luck attached naturally . Despite the range of respectable names and three actors in the title role Ramsay Martin Landau and Tony Nardi there is n't the charisma or the talent to bring us in and feel anything . We are merely passive observers in a life we are glad not to have lead . The people shown here were born in to a cruel world but their only mark was to make it crueler . If you ca n't get enough of the gangster genre that will be better than watching Godfather for the tenth time and it is even better as basic entertainment than the horrible misfire that was Godfather,1,0,0.9162737110210122,0.0837262889789878

There were some similarities between American GRAFFITTI and HAPPY DAYS . Both opened with Rock Around the Clock'' by Bill Haley the Comets . Both took place in a bygone era and both featured Ron Howard as one of the leading roles . But there were also some major differences . While American GRAFFITTI took place in California and centered around a group of newly graduated high school students about to take that big step into adulthood HAPPY DAYS took place in Milwaulkee Wisconson and centered around a group of teenagers in high school dealing with the joys and tribulations of adolescence . HAPPY DAYS originally opened with the juke box playing the original version of Bill Haley the Comets ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK . But when oldies became hot thanks to the success of American GRAFFITTI and the original version of ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK entered the Billboard Hot and became a hit again in royalty payments went through the roof . So a remake'' of the song correct term is now new stereo recording'' was quickly substituted . The current theme song for HAPPY DAYS was then introduced for the second season if memory serves me right . Fans and foes alike agree that this show is escapist . Liberties were taken and details overlooked making this show less than completely authentic . This is perfectly fine . HAPPY DAYS is supposed to be a comedy not a history lesson . But occasionally the writers did sometimes stick their necks out by hitting on controversial topics . One episode centered around the Cunninghams building of a fall out shelter . Another episode was about a divorced woman moving into the neighborhood with a dream of starting a new life . The topic of prejudice was addressed when Howard was invited to the wedding of an old army buddy who just happened to be black an era when prejudice and discrimination was sadly an acceptable part of the American way of life The issue of the draft even came up on a later episode ! The show as originally set in One problem that was dealt wisely was with the cast . Most of them were teenagers and as each year passed it was obvious that they grew older so the series aged with the cast moving the series out of the safe waters of the Eisenhower years into the Age of Camelot all the way with JFK and then into the turbulent later half of the That along with the writers running out of ideas and later cast members like Ron Howard leaving the series wisely quitting while they were ahead left me wishing that they had all done the right thing by pulling the plug on this show and quitting while they were ahead . That along with the idol worshiping studio audience who just could n't control themselves every time the Great Fonzie entered the scene began to wear very thin very fast . This show originally portrayed the Fabulous Fifties as we LIKE to remember that era . Time heals wounds you know . Everything has its place and though would prefer hearing the original hit versions'' over those new stereo recordings'' those new stereo recordings'' worked very well on HAPPY DAYS . And this is where find myself regretting my buying the DVD ! Unlike the complete first season DVD the original music on the complete second season has been replaced with different music . While it is great that the original episodes were digitally restored to digital perfection the removal of the original music destroyed what it was that made this show so much fun to watch !,0,1,0.0821262286305255,0.9178737713694743

ANY Where's the kyuubi of Naruto Not once does he turn demon . mean COME ON My advice is . see the series until episode then it's just fillers and then read the Manga because that's still great . Ignore this movie and hope for something better in the future . All and all gave it a just because it's Naruto .,0,1,0.0875750081817505,0.9124249918182494

It was the world premiere of it in the tiny cinema in the Triskel Arts Centre as part of the Cork Film Festival . found Strange Fruit'' to be an excellent movie . It is a bit rough around the edges but for a low movie that is to be expected ! In general the acting from the main lead Kent Faulcon is wonderful the cinematography and direction excellent and the script hugely entertaining and thought with some nice set and witty dialogue . The ending was a bit sudden with no conclusion given to characters and events once the finale came to its gripping end but perhaps that's what the filmmakers were going for ? It certainly did make the movie more unsettling . did like the fact that the main character never came to terms with his mother on screen it leaves you wondering whether or not he ever will as in real sometimes these things are never settled . This was a good choice to leave it unresolved rather than sentimentally wrapping it up ! Taut and suspenseful throughout Strange Fruit'' is a hugely ambitious debut and have high hopes for what the writer Kyle Schickner will unleash next . He and his colleagues are a talent worth watching . hope Strange Fruit'' gets a wider release soon as more people deserve to see this movie an above thriller with some original and insightful twists on homophobia and racism in America's Deep South . Highly Recommended,0,1,0.0601543830923563,0.9398456169076436

The movie premise the costumes the special effects the acting . It all was ahead of its time . It opened the door for movies such as Star Wars the Terminator the Matrix and movies . Now people look at it and they say Well this does not add up to this new special effects story . It did not have any computer graphics and such as the new movies do these days . It did have a story and a wonderful cast and a hell of a director ! The places it was filmed like the Dallas World Trade Center and the Zale Building the Ft. Worth Water Gardens were at that time the most modern and futuristic backdrops in which to film . The director Michael Anderson was very creative and he tried to show a perfect future that was flawed by human desires and frailty's . It was my first film experience the first of six films have been in . Just because it was filmed in Texas does not make it any less a wonderful piece of filmmaker's art . Watch it again and appreciate it more . This movie was the foundation that set the standard for many great films that we now enjoy . Well my hand is blinking . got to run .

He has had a steady string of appearances before he burst back on the scene . He was memorable in Domino Sin City Man on Fire Once Upon a Time in Mexico and Get Carter . But in his powerful dramatic performance in The Wrestler we see a full blown presentation of the character only hinted at in Get Carter . Whenever we get to know him Rourke remains a cool but sleazy muscle bound slim ball . This is an Elmore Leonard story and production . Leonard wrote such notable movies as taunt western thriller to Yuma Be Cool Jackie Brown Get Shorty Pick and Joe Kidd . This means that we get tough guys some good some not so good . It also means we get tight realistic plots with characters doing what is best for them in each situation weaving complications into violent conclusions . Killshot is no different . Tough slim ball killer Rourke stalks unhappily married witness Lane . Think History of Violence meets No Country for Old Men . It is not as intense bloody or gory as those two but it is almost as good . If you like those two including David Croneberg's equally wonderful Eastern Promises you will like Killshot also . Director John Madden has not done a lot of movies . His last few were enjoyable if not successful Proof Captain Corelli's Mandolin and Shakespeare in Love . Diana Lane has n't had a powerful movie role since she and Richard Gere gave incredible performances in Unfaithful . Lately she is charming and appealing in romantic stories such as Nights in Rodanthe Must Love Dogs and Under the Tuscan Sun . Here she is right on mark balancing her sexy appeal with reserved tension . This is a small part for Rosario Dawson . Yet Dawson does a good job with it . You see a lot more of Lane including an underwear scene to rival Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut . While you are in the crime drama section also pick up Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Gone Baby Gone and Before the Devil Knows Your Dead . The last has wonderful performances by Phillip Seymour Hoffman Ethan Hawke Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney . Killshot flopped at the box office . More is our luck . It is certainly worth a dollar rental if you like this genre .,0,1,0.0488268569641316,0.9511731430358684
11653_3.txt, based on the comment made so far everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a great movie it ha it interesting moment for one thing it wa filmed on location in colorado it breckinridge or telluride ca n remember but it is in the credit the location is absolutely stunning and spectacular it s beautiful even to me who lived in colorado for several year next it ha disney s penchant for wonderful character actor harry morgan ha never been in better form than when he play in a disney movie he is literally hysterical also remember the wonderful mary wickes although she ha a bit part in this movie she is great a always if you do n know who she is think of the animated disney version of hunchback from notre dame wa one of the gargoyle and she wa also the most interesting nun in sister act a well a the best nun in the trouble with angel she ha always been a great character actress and most character actor never receive the recognition they deserve in addition to character actor and all cast in the disney may have not had the greatest movie but if you really watch some of them from beginning to end you will notice that every movie ha some really funny or hysterical moment in it the entire movie may not be funny but there is always a comic gem least or in every single live movie disney ever made whether it s harry morgan in one of his bellowing tone of voice or tim conway floundering around or joe flynn giving one of his priceless look of horror it is all good the whole film may not be good but there are always hysterical moment in every disney film from this period that have ever seen disney in this time period always managed to make a person smile despite the dumbness of the film bsed on these comment disagree with viewer who say every disney movie in this time period is awful that statement it not quite accurate rather it is easier for me to give credit to the funny moment and overlook the weakness in the plot some live disney movie are true classic yeller bedknobs and broomstick mary poppins but for those that are n am able to appreciate them for what they were good clean family fun in a time when movie had become vulgar crude and offensive, Based on the comments made so far everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it . think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a GREAT movie it has its interesting moments . For one thing it was filmed on location in Colorado it Breckinridge or Telluride ? ca n't remember but it is in the credits The location is absolutely stunning and spectacular . It's beautiful even to me who lived in Colorado for several years . Next it has Disney's penchant for wonderful character actors . Harry Morgan has never been in better form than when he plays in a Disney movie . He is literally hysterical . Also remember the wonderful Mary Wickes ? Although she has a bit part'' in this movie she is great as always . If you do n't know who she is think of the animated Disney version of Hunchback from Notre Dame was one of the gargoyles and she was also the most interesting nun in Sister Act'' as well as the best nun in The Trouble With Angels . She has always been a great character actress and most character actors never receive the recognition they deserve . In addition to character actors and all casts in the Disney may have not had the greatest'' movies but if you really watch some of them from beginning to end you will NOTICE that every movie has some really funny or hysterical moment in it . The entire movie may not be funny but there is always a comic gem least or in every single live movie Disney ever made . Whether it's Harry Morgan in one of his bellowing tones of voice or Tim Conway floundering around or Joe Flynn giving one of his priceless looks of horror it is all good . The whole film may not be good but there are ALWAYS hysterical moments in every Disney film from this period that have ever seen . Disney in this time period always managed to make a person smile despite the dumbness of the film . Bsed on these comments disagree with viewers who say every Disney movie in this time period is awful . That statement it not quite accurate . Rather it is easier for me to give credit to the funny moments and overlook the weaknesses in the plots . Some live Disney movies are true classics Yeller Bedknobs and Broomsticks Mary Poppins but for those that are n't am able to appreciate them for what they were good clean family fun in a time when movies had become vulgar crude and offensive .,0,1,0.0382865712802228,0.9617134287197772

It has not my knowledge been released on DVD or VHS although shall browse around for a copy . The film tells the story of three young people two girls one on the edge of puberty and the other much younger and a young boy who go to live with their mother's brother and his young mute Irish wife . His wife also has two brothers who live with them . The children's uncle is an unpleasant control freak who forces his young wife to wear a silver collar whilst she watches a marionette show put on by him and her brothers in his toyshop . The eldest girl and one of the Irishmen younger develop a love for each other whilst they live in the same house . The girl helps her aunt out in the shop whilst her brother helps his uncle to make things in the workshop . There are a lot of very disturbing elements to the film . There is the uncle's treatment of his wife as some kind of dumb possession by the collar whilst the Irish indulge dancing drinking and somewhat forbidden love . Interestingly though have seen far more explicit themes played out in other movies made in Hollywood today . Makes you wonder whether the British film industry and the BBC have some kind of hidden agenda going on . Still despite it not being a children's movie there are a lot of playful magic moments in it and the one Irishman does some beautiful paintings .,0,1,0.0588435702328371,0.9411564297671628
