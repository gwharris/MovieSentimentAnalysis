1376_8.txt, was having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me and could n't put it down until the end . and had forgotten about my horrid day . and the ending . by the way . where is the sequel ! the budget is obviously extremely low . but look what they did with it ! it reminds me of a play . they are basically working with a tent a pod a few guns uniforms camping gear and a thing . that is it for props . maybe this is even a good thing forcing the acting and writing to have to step up and take their rightful place in film as the centers of the work instead of as afterthoughts used to have an excuse to make cgi fights the cgi is fine . it is not exactly but imho it still works . why ? because there is n't too much of it and what there is is not over with an army of effects house people trying to cram everything they can into the shot . it prompts the imagination . it's some relatively simple stuff with decent composition the heavy freighter shot . there is one long shot that must be at least ten seconds . tracks the entire length of the ship . it must be a record for sci fi battle sequence film making in the past years to have an action sequence that lasts longer than seconds and some relation to the story . it might look old or not of the art but it does n't look stupid and it does n't take away from the story . the acting is good except the characters die too fast to get to know them . the captain was great but a few of his scenes could have used another take . also got confused with his character losing his cool and stomping on a corpse like to think captains are calm cool and in control . what was going on in that scene ? did the other crew worry about him losing it at that moment ? did he feel himself losing control ? now as for the plot . mostly it is good . why ? because it does n't try to explain itself . it just happens . it's called planet its a mystery get it ? nobody knows why there is a statue and they do n't find out either . the mysterious cult ? the weird scientist with the tattoo ? what do you expect to find out in less than minutes ? this is n't war and peace . and thank god it's not star wars either . no midichlorians no minutes of expository boring dialog that has no purpose in the story . the characters are stranded and are only able to figure out a few basic things . it is not a star trek episode where they find out it's leonardo davinci or a child like space wanderer . it is mysterious and liked that . do n't know why maybe can identify with these guys more since they do n't know whats happening and do n't either . they do n't talk a lot of space gibberish or have magic boxes telling them what is happening . in fact would argue that one of the weakest moments is when the turns on the crew and tries to the reason for the planet the cult etc . this coincidentally has some of the weakest dialog imho in the whole movie and it interrupts the flow and some of the characters look unnatural in that scene . ok sometimes felt it was a little too mysterious though . like why did the guy get fried through his eyes with lightning ? that was odd . just weird . the ending . again would have liked to have known some of these characters better . and would it have been so hard to have a second rescue scene at the end ? this is not a serial show it was a film and we like closure in films even if they can have a sequel . imagine hamlet with no of angels sing thee to thy rest anyways . what can say . this was well worth the dollar payed at the box machine at the supermarket . it was also imho a better piece of storytelling than starwars parts or like said it sucked me in wanting to know what was happening and could n't stop watching until the end ., was having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me and could n't put it down until the end . and had forgotten about my horrid day . and the ending . by the way . where is the sequel ! the budget is obviously extremely low . but look what they did with it ! it reminds me of a play . they are basically working with a tent a pod a few guns uniforms camping gear and a thing . that is it for props . Maybe this is even a good thing forcing the acting and writing to have to step up and take their rightful place in film as the centers of the work instead of as afterthoughts used to have an excuse to make CGI fights The cgi is fine . It is not exactly but imho it still works . why ? because there is n't too much of it and what there is is not over with an army of effects house people trying to cram everything they can into the shot . it prompts the imagination . it's some relatively simple stuff with decent composition the heavy freighter shot . there is one long shot that must be at least ten seconds . tracks the entire length of the ship . it must be a record for sci fi battle sequence film making in the past years to have an action sequence that lasts longer than seconds and some relation to the story . it might look old or not of the art but it does n't look stupid and it does n't take away from the story . The acting is good except the characters die too fast to get to know them . The captain was great but a few of his scenes could have used another take . also got confused with his character losing his cool and stomping on a corpse like to think captains are calm cool and in control . what was going on in that scene ? did the other crew worry about him losing it at that moment ? did he feel himself losing control ? Now as for the plot . mostly it is good . why ? Because it does n't try to explain itself . It just happens . It's called planet its a mystery get it ? Nobody knows why there is a statue and they do n't find out either . The mysterious cult ? The weird scientist with the tattoo ? What do you expect to find out in less than minutes ? This is n't War and Peace . And thank god it's not star wars either . No midichlorians no minutes of expository boring dialog that has no purpose in the story . The characters are stranded and are only able to figure out a few basic things . it is not a star trek episode where they find out it's leonardo davinci or a child like space wanderer . It is mysterious and liked that . do n't know why maybe can identify with these guys more since they do n't know whats happening and do n't either . they do n't talk a lot of space gibberish or have magic boxes telling them what is happening . In fact would argue that one of the weakest moments is when the turns on the crew and tries to the reason for the planet the cult etc . This coincidentally has some of the weakest dialog imho in the whole movie and it interrupts the flow and some of the characters look unnatural in that scene . OK sometimes felt it was a little too mysterious though . Like why did the guy get fried through his eyes with lightning ? That was odd . Just weird . The ending . again would have liked to have known some of these characters better . And would it have been so hard to have a second rescue scene at the end ? This is not a serial show it was a film and we like closure in films even if they can have a sequel . Imagine Hamlet with no of angels sing thee to thy rest Anyways . What can say . This was well worth the dollar payed at the box machine at the supermarket . It was also imho a better piece of storytelling than starwars parts or Like said it sucked me in wanting to know what was happening and could n't stop watching until the end .,1,0,0.9367009038614704,0.0632990961385295

10581_10.txt, haggard the movie is the real life story of ryan dunn and his girlfriend who cheated on him also with the help from his two friend skate boarder who lives for nothing and trying funny scientist does n't really work played by bam margera and brandom dicamillo . the film haggard the movie also has a lot of the characters from jackass etc but to say it was written by bam margera and co. this is a very weak attempt seems to me like it was written when he was bored or as a project with they did not pay a lot of attention to . the films also stars bam's girlfriend jennifer rivell who plays glauren ryan's girlfriend who basically cheated on him again very bad acting by jennifer another actor that some people may be interested in is steve hellboy played by rakeyohn which his character does not seem to be with the story again bad acting also this character does not really have a lot of lines in this film which basically makes it very boring . but worst of all is raab's character the voice sound like a smoker who basically has throat cancer also think he could have been improved ! overall think the characters in this film are n't with the story like in one scene it would be on one certain character a minute later a different scene different character . to say that this is supposed to be a film sort of a documentary its not played by the characters as a documentary the acting makes you think that its a cheap attempt at making a film with your spare time . towards the middle of the film we start to lose focus on the main character ryan dunn although a lot of the attention is on bam and brandon . in conclusion this film is ok if you laugh at things that are n't very funny stupid stunts terrible acting and the occasional nude scene ! also think there there are too many scenes of just no talking and just music !, Haggard The Movie is the real life story of Ryan Dunn and his girlfriend who cheated on him also with the help from his two friend skate boarder who lives for nothing and trying funny scientist does n't really work played by Bam Margera and Brandom Dicamillo . The film Haggard The Movie also has a lot of the characters from Jackass etc but to say it was written by Bam Margera and Co. this is a very weak attempt seems to me like it was written when he was bored or as a project with they did not pay a lot of attention to . The films also stars Bam's girlfriend Jennifer Rivell who plays Glauren Ryan's girlfriend who basically cheated on him again very bad acting by Jennifer another actor that some people may be interested in is Steve Hellboy played by RakeYohn which his character does not seem to be with the story again bad acting also this character does not really have a lot of lines in this film which basically makes it very boring . but worst of all is Raab's character the voice sound like a smoker who basically has throat cancer also think he could have been improved ! Overall think the characters in this film are n't with the story like in one scene it would be on one certain character a minute later a different scene different character . To say that this is supposed to be a film sort of a documentary its not played by the characters as a documentary the acting makes you think that its a cheap attempt at making a film with your spare time . Towards the middle of the film we start to lose focus on the main character Ryan Dunn although a lot of the attention is on Bam and Brandon . In conclusion this film is OK if you laugh at things that are n't very funny stupid stunts terrible acting and the occasional nude scene ! Also think there there are too many scenes of just no talking and just music !,1,0,0.9197529988860912,0.0802470011139088

8134_7.txt, this was laurel and hardy's last silent film for roach studios . however since the public had a real thirst for talkies'' this same short was re by the team just a few years later with only a few small plot changes . laughing gravy was essentially the same plot except that stan and ollie were trying to hide a cute puppy from their grouchy landlord a goat like in angora love . this whole goat angle is the worst part of the film . while you could understand the boys wanting to keep a cute little dog all it is snowy outside why exactly they bring a goat home is just contrived and pointless . according to the plot the goat followed them home and so they got tired of shooing it away and kept it . huh ? this just does n't make any sense it had been a giraffe or a cow would they have done the same thing ? apart from being an unconvincing plot the movie itself is pure laurel and hardy with a familiar plot and familiar roles for the comedians . this film features quite a few laughs but unfortunately is n't one of their better films to wrap up their silent careers . this aspect of their careers just seems to have ended with a whimper ., This was Laurel and Hardy's last silent film for Roach Studios . However since the public had a real thirst for talkies'' this same short was re by the team just a few years later with only a few small plot changes . LAUGHING GRAVY was essentially the same plot except that Stan and Ollie were trying to hide a cute puppy from their grouchy landlord a goat like in ANGORA LOVE . This whole goat angle is the worst part of the film . While you could understand the boys wanting to keep a cute little dog all it is snowy outside why exactly they bring a goat home is just contrived and pointless . According to the plot the goat followed them home and so they got tired of shooing it away and kept it . Huh ? This just does n't make any sense it had been a giraffe or a cow would they have done the same thing ? Apart from being an unconvincing plot the movie itself is pure Laurel and Hardy with a familiar plot and familiar roles for the comedians .

This aspect of their careers just seems to have ended with a whimper .,1,0,0.9600903282319168,0.0399096717680831

For starters Simon Wincer's back a man who's name is synonymous with high TV westerns . Unfortunately the problems with Moon'' are something even the most talented director could n't solve poor script based on a lackluster novel . Forget historical accuracies as any reader of the novels can tell you the biggest travesty in Moon'' is that it's not even consistent with information from the original Lonesome Dove'' masterpiece . So many wonderful rich moments in the miniseries and to an even greater degree the book are completely missing in Moon . Considering the fact that most viewers of Moon'' are probably coming with at least some sort of Dove'' background the lack of character and emotional backstory is downright painful . That said Moon'' is one instance where the adapted version could and should have been altered to make it more suitable for the screen . For example the novel Moon'' focuses largely on the Comanches themselves . To its credit the miniseries tries to service the Comanches but in the end it gives them just enough that the viewer just gets a sense they're missing out on some important part of the story . Similarly Val Kilmer's Scull loses out here too the role should have either been expanded so Kilmer Rachel Griffiths for that matter actually had something to do or the roles should have just been reduced to smaller supporting parts . Instead Kilmer gets top billing for a character that just leaves you scratching your head after his appearance in the completely bizarre final act . There's strange moments throughout the film that just make no sense to those who have n't read the book killer parrot ? what ? further there is n't a single scene that shows us that Call and McCrae are anything near the amazing Texas rangers they claim to be . Not a single one of their expeditions in Moon Dead Man's Walk for that matter ends successfully and Call and McCrae just seem to blunder their way through one pointless mission after another . Frankly Larry McMurtry should never have been given the job of writing the script and only did so because of the praise surrounding that other cowboy movie Brokeback Mountain . McMurtry can write good novels there's some dissension over the consistency of that statement but he's never exactly established himself as a scriptwriter . This production would have benefited from not only bringing back director Wincer but original screenwriter Bill Wittcliff to adapt the novel to screen . Witcliff does n't exactly have a mountainload of material to his screen writing credit but no one can deny he did a fantastic job at whittling down the original Lonesome Dove . With all this said Comanche Moon'' is almost a brilliant production aided by a terrific cast that unfortunately just are n't given enough to do . Steve Zahn's portrayal of Gus McCrae or rather his portrayal of Robert Duvall as Gus McCrae is dead And while some have criticized Karl Urban as Woodrow Call saying his performance does n't imitate the quiet stoic Woodrow of the original movie all can say is blame McMurtry because McMurtry is the one who both in the Moon'' novel and now the miniseries turned Woodrow from socially inept awkward but natural leader into some emotionless character whose lines are just dull and whose character motivations are only clear if you've seen them portrayed far more adequately in the sequel'' Still it's the cast that sparkles in Moon to the degree that left the miniseries with that same feeling of melancholy felt watching the original Lonesome Dove'' this time because realized it's probably the last time we'll see these characters appear on screen for a long long time to come and quite honestly this cast could have done so well in a well full network TV series . All in all aside from wasted opportunities with the cast the biggest travesty is that the original Lonesome Dove novel contained so much rich backstory for the characters that would have been fascinating utterly fascinating to see translated on screen . Unfortunately all that has been tossed aside in favor of McMurtry's tedious inconsistent and ultimately irrelevant prequel .,1,0,0.9625265981784032,0.0374734018215969

It is n't that this movie is necessarily bad for your health but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie . You can count the number of pages by Anne Rice that I've read on one hand but after seeing this movie and Interview with a Vampire get the feeling that she writes really good novels . The plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history . Still Stuart Townsend's voice narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than Brad Pitt's vampire narrative ever did and you can tell that QUEEN OF THE DAMNED's limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the Anne Rice storyline . While Interview decided to go with lace and elegance QUEEN relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously . One can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places . The costumes and rock roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack . However I'll give credit where credit is due . The soundtrack is excellent . Korn and Disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like Butthead . The film opens with a very cool Goth zoom splice montage but after the first ten minutes or so the directing degenerates quickly . It's as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there was n't enough time and enough money to do an Anne Rice novel justice . What results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects . Unfortunately QUEEN OF THE DAMNED fails to do the genre justice just as its John Carpenter counterparts fail to impress . Where are the yellow contacts ? Where's the pale blue make Scene after scene shook my head reminiscing about the days of Salem's Lot and Fright Night when low budget was done right . There are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage . Props to Aaliyah and may her soul forever rest in peace . She might have become a renowned actress had her life not been taken from us so prematurely for she did give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing . Did mention that the soundtrack was good ? Let's see what else can say ? It was n't too long . The Anne Rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like Francis Ford Coppola got his hands on it . There are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot . But all in all it was a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of second vampire movies out there . The director of this movie went on to direct a new Battlestar Galactica mini series if that tells you anything . JY Jimboduck,1,0,0.9079184424951244,0.0920815575048754

Glenn McQuaid the film's writer is a laddish Irishman who introduced the screening by announcing that whilst it was in progress he would be out for a pint do n't begrudge him a drink but by telling us about it he seemed to feel he needed to certify his laddishness or his Irishness or both . When the opening credits rolled there were as usual at press screenings loud ovations for the names of every actor or crew member who'd got friends in the audience and silence for those who had n't . McQuaid returned for a witty afterwards . This horror movie does n't take itself seriously which is good because its humour is considerably stronger than its horror . Only one scene is even remotely scary and most of the is merely gross but laughed throughout much of the film . This movie appears to be set in Ireland circa which time grave was mostly defunct The story is told in flashback we get flashbacks within flashbacks and the narrating character flashbacks material that he could n't know about because sometimes he was n't present or one case because the action is unfolding behind his back . The story begins with a prisoner being taken to the guillotine . Guillotines were n't used in Ireland but for once we actually see a plausible guillotine sequence . The prisoner struggles on his way to execution the rope cleats are accurate and the prisoner manages to look up to see the blade overhead . there's a payoff later to justify the historically inaccurate use of the guillotine itself . The characters are ostensibly Irish but one major character speaks in Cockney slang using phrases like mug's game'' and take a butcher's'' a look For once actors in roles display dental hygiene yet nearly all the clothes and hairstyles the women's make are resolutely I'm not complaining in the case of Heather Bullock who wears a very fetching black miniskirt cozzie that appears to be PVC . Phworr ! The lead actors Ron Perlman are excellent but most of the supporting cast have no sense of the Victorian period . The worst offender is Joel Garland as the publican whose characterisation is firmly rooted in the twenty century . Just when thought that Garland's performance could n't get any less Victorian he used his fingers to make ironic'' air The sets Angus Scrimm's lab are detailed and impressive yet failed to convince me that people actually lived and worked in these places . Nearly every interior contains burning candles but never once did see what would have been there if these were actual Victorian homes or workplaces leftover drippings from previous candles . One scene features an extra was annoyed that McQuaid plumped for a stereotypical grey'' Schwa alien rather than something original . There are splendid montage sequences but McQuaid opts for flashy effects split overhead shots that do n't serve the story . was impressed by a recurring blue device superimposing the main characters heads over other backgrounds . Less effective was a recurring motif of camera shots morphing actors faces into drawings resembling panel art from EC horror comics . I'm a fan of EC Comics but they do n't belong in Ireland . The money that McQuaid spent on flashy photo showing off his editing skills without serving the story should've been spent on accurate costumes . BIG SPOILERS NOW . Ron Perlman gives an Oirish'' performance full of acting tics . Ostensibly playing a Irish priest he writes with his left hand . Victorian Ireland left children were punished for using the devil's hand'' and were forcibly retrained to become righties . But Perlman's character turns out to have a reason for concealing his right hand . Elsewhere a character is bitten by a zombie yet suffers no ill effects so knew there'd be a payoff later . Several scenes that would more logically take place at night are shot in daylight apparently only because this was easier and less expensive . McQuaid is a proficient director and editor he could easily have shot day for night'' but using a process effect to help tell the story seems to interest him much less than showing off his flashy editing techniques . McQuaid seems to be giving homage to those great old Hammer horror flicks . But those Hammers were so great because the actors and production designers worked hard to convince us that we were actually witnessing events in Whitechapel or wherever . Sell the Dead almost entirely fails to evoke the century . Glenn McQuaid shows talent as a director scripter and editor yet in all three capacities here he makes odd choices then largely fails to justify those choices .

First of all there's the music . It's just plain awful . There are only songs in the movie most of them used more than once . The opening song is shrieked by a chorus of annoying children and the disco title track is performed by Rick Dees . It does n't get any worse than that . Even the background music is terrible with much of it repeating the themes of the other nauseating tunes . We also get some truly lame slapstick mostly in the opening credits . On the other hand Bill Murray is spot on brilliant as usual . have to wonder if he ad the whole thing or if the writers just gave him all the funny lines . Or maybe he's just that great turning a weak script into comic genius . The best part are his surreal PA announcements . out of here . a menace ! You also get a lot more character development than you have any right to expect in a movie like this . At least half the characters seem like real people . mostly real people you would like to have around . Even Spaz'' gets to do a more than any other Eddie Deezen character ever did and when he gets the girl it's plausible . not absurdly hot but he does n't automatically pair up with one of the nerd girls see Revenge Of The Nerds'' for examples of both cinematic phenomenons . And when the plot seems clich ya got ta wonder if it was n't a clich yet when they made this . While it was n't the first summer camp movie ya got ta go back at least to The Parent Trap'' it's certainly the movie that made it it's own genre . In fact was surprised that there was no Talent Show scene . Hot American Summer'' spoofed the summer genre so perfectly just assumed everything in it came straight out of Meatballs . also half Jon Cryer to pull up in a convertible with a chimp thanks to Mr. Show's'' epic camp spoof Monk Academy'' Anyway this one seems to be vanishing a little as far as the late comedies it's not a cable staple anymore and certainly does n't have the cult following of Caddyshack or Animal House . was pleased to catch it on Showtime today and in High Definition at that !

Naturally the film is rather messy therefore but the fact that all three monsters are there is usually enough to ensure that the film's sixty seven minutes do n't become boring . It's obvious that the idea of making another monster mash came into the writer's head before an actual plot did as the yarn we're given is n't exactly without holes . The plot sees Count Dracula arrive at Dr. Edelman's home asking for a cure for his vampirism . Then what can only be described as a coincidence sees Lawrence Talbot The Wolf Man turn up asking for a cure for his affliction ! It turns out that Dracula is on the prowl for Edelman's daughter but Talbot really is serious . When it turns out that he ca n't be stopped from turning into a wolf The Wolf Man throws himself into the sea . he ends up finding Frankenstein's Monster . Overall this film is n't as good as the earlier House of Frankenstein . The film put its plot together better than this entry in the series does as the plot here does n't give equal time to each Universal monster . Dracula's plot is the biggest at first but soon fizzles out only to resurface at the end . The Wolf Man is the star of the show but his story never really develops and is essentially just another version of the plot he always finds himself in . Frankenstein's Monster is given the coldest hand as he appears in the movie merely as an afterthought and an obvious excuse to ensure that all three monsters appear in the movie . The story of the doctor who binds all three together is the most interesting but this is a little disappointing as he is n't the reason why people will see this film . The acting is good enough with John Carradine showing his sinister side and Lon Chaney Jr once again making sure that his character is bathed in tragedy . Glenn Strange is given nothing to do and Onslow Stevens proves the real highlight as Dr Edelman . Overall this film wo n't do much for anyone that is n't a fan of Universal horror but as silly monster movies go House of Dracula is worth seeing .,1,0,0.9103212077625624,0.0896787922374376
4191_10.txt, this all masterpiece is about the monkees becoming aware that they are fictional characters in a movie and that everything they do or say had already been written in an script they seem to be following . head was written by jack nicholson rafelson and peter tork during a three lsd trip in a suite at an expensive hollywood hotel . the other three monkees only acted in it . they fight this every way they can by doing things not in the script . they deliberately flub their lines walk off sets tear up scenery punch other actors for no reason and ultimately commit suicide by jumping off a bridge . for instance in the rapid flashes of a psychedelic party scene if you watch frame you can see rafelson sitting next to the camera and cameraman very deliberately shooting into a mirror . he is revealing that the party is actually fake and is being shot in a studio with actors who suddenly drop out of character and walk away in the middle of a conversation when the director yells cut ! the monkees however never drop out of character because those characters are also who they really are . that ends up being the core of the revelation soon to come . at every turn they realize their increasingly actions were exactly what they were supposed to do in the scripted film they ca n't escape being in . you say they went crazy and walked through the sky turns out to be painted on paper and hung from the ceiling as the set's background no problem ! hey hey they're the monkees and those wacky guys just keep monkeying around ! in the end even their deaths did not set them free . that was how the movie was supposed to end and their motionless waterlogged bodies are fished out of the river put in another box and stacked in a film studio warehouse until the characters are needed again for another studio production . this is made all the more poignant by the fact that the monkees really are fictional characters who forced themselves into the real world . they did it through the power of their music . ironically near the end peter tork has what he rightly sees as a hugely profound revelation that solves their problem but unfortunately no one listens . peter realizes it does n't matter if we're in the box film he means that it does n't matter if will is free or illusory and that the only important thing is that you just let the present moment occur and occur . you need to just let happen as it happens'' without analyzing or evaluating or judging whether the experience is valid'' by some abstract definition . when you ca n't even tell the difference will being free or not does n't matter to figure out if you are the real'' you is just a pointless waste of time . saw this film at a very important time in my life . was trying to figure out how to escape being just that geeky creepy nerd girl'' by thinking about it intensely instead of just having fun sex like everyone else did . but the revelation in head broke my self recursive trap and helped me more than rafelson or nicholson or tork will ever know . for decades i've watched head'' and wished could thank pete . was this a good movie ? uhh how about like . yes, This all masterpiece is about the Monkees becoming aware that they are fictional characters in a movie and that everything they do or say had already been written in an script they seem to be following . Head was written by Jack Nicholson Rafelson and Peter Tork during a three LSD trip in a suite at an expensive Hollywood hotel . The other three Monkees only acted in it . They fight this every way they can by doing things not in the script . They deliberately flub their lines walk off sets tear up scenery punch other actors for no reason and ultimately commit suicide by jumping off a bridge . For instance in the rapid flashes of a psychedelic party scene if you watch frame you can see Rafelson sitting next to the camera and cameraman very deliberately shooting into a mirror . He is revealing that the party is actually fake and is being shot in a studio with actors who suddenly drop out of character and walk away in the middle of a conversation when the Director yells cut ! The Monkees however never drop out of character because those characters are also who they really are . That ends up being the core of the Revelation soon to come . At every turn they realize their increasingly actions were exactly what they were supposed to do in the scripted film they ca n't escape being in . You say they went crazy and walked through the sky turns out to be painted on paper and hung from the ceiling as the set's background No problem ! Hey hey they're the Monkees and those wacky guys just keep monkeying around ! In the end even their deaths did not set them free . That was how the movie was supposed to end and their motionless waterlogged bodies are fished out of the river put in another box and stacked in a film studio warehouse until the characters are needed again for another studio production . This is made all the more poignant by the fact that the Monkees really ARE fictional characters who forced themselves into the real world . They did it through the power of their music . Ironically near the end Peter Tork has what he rightly sees as a hugely profound revelation that solves their problem but unfortunately no one listens . Peter realizes It does n't MATTER if we're in the box film He means that it does n't matter if will is free or illusory and that the only important thing is that you just let the present moment occur and occur . You need to just let HAPPEN as it happens'' without analyzing or evaluating or judging whether the experience is valid'' by some abstract definition . When you ca n't even tell the difference will being free or not does n't matter to figure out if you are the real'' you is just a pointless waste of time . saw this film at a very important time in my life . was trying to figure out how to escape being just that geeky creepy nerd girl'' by thinking about it intensely instead of just having fun sex like everyone else did . But the revelation in Head broke my self recursive trap and helped me more than Rafelson or Nicholson or Tork will ever know . For decades I've watched Head'' and wished could thank Pete . Was this a good movie ? Uhh how about like . YES,1,0,0.9288335191088916,0.0711664808911083
1369_7.txt, my buddies and spent the majority of a saturday afternoon watching a selection of bad'' movies . among the flicks we watched the strongest contender quality bad fare was easily jack it's ludicrous that movies such as gigli'' glitter'' and you got served'' are listed in imdbs bottom while they're certainly bad movies they do n't belong in the bottom they're robbing jack and keeper of time'' etc of the bad movie greatness they so richly deserve . so what makes jack so great bad movie terms for starters steve latshaw the director decided to cast his son ryan latshaw in the role of sean kelly . unfortunately for steve ryan latshaw was dangerously close to being out by a block of wood . the kid seriously has no ability to emote whatsoever . the end result unintentional comic gold . the kid could be listening to a joke or just moments away from getting his head smashed asunder and his expression is one of stony emotionlessness'' the other aspect of the movie that we found awesome was the sheer number of double dreaming'' sequences . what is a double well it's when a character wakes up from a nightmare and then something equally nightmarish happens and then the character wakes up again . basically they wake up after dreaming about waking up from a nightmare . clever device no ? believe the character of sean kelly experienced no less than double sequences . let's see . what else ? oh yeah ! this movie has a veritable cast of thousands . it's truly stunning to see how many speaking roles are introduced throughout the course of the movie . best of all almost none of the characters have anything to do with the story . they're either killed by jack or they serve no purpose whatsoever . jack himself was pretty sweet . like most other monsters jack has the amazing ability to seemingly teleport over great distances . he's invariably hanging somewhere in the background whenever you're dealing with a major character . what's puzzling however is that when he's actually chasing someone he moves at a shambling speed and yet he's able to keep up with people who are sprinting . that's all for now . closing remarks if you're looking for a unintentionally hilarious bad movie you ca n't go wrong by renting this beast . bad movie score good movie score, My buddies and spent the majority of a Saturday afternoon watching a selection of bad'' movies . Among the flicks we watched the strongest contender quality bad fare was easily Jack It's ludicrous that movies such as Gigli'' Glitter'' and You Got Served'' are listed in IMDBs bottom While they're certainly bad movies they do n't belong in the bottom They're robbing Jack and Keeper of Time'' etc of the Bad Movie Greatness they so richly deserve . So what makes Jack so great bad movie terms For starters Steve Latshaw the director decided to cast his son Ryan Latshaw in the role of Sean Kelly . Unfortunately for Steve Ryan Latshaw was dangerously close to being out by a block of wood . The kid seriously has no ability to emote whatsoever . The end result unintentional comic gold . The kid could be listening to a joke or just moments away from getting his head smashed asunder and his expression is one of stony emotionlessness'' The other aspect of the movie that we found awesome was the sheer number of double dreaming'' sequences . What is a double Well it's when a character wakes up from a nightmare and then something equally nightmarish happens and then the character wakes up again . Basically they wake up after dreaming about waking up from a nightmare . Clever device no ? believe the character of Sean Kelly experienced no less than double sequences . Let's see . what else ? Oh yeah ! This movie has a veritable cast of thousands . It's truly stunning to see how many speaking roles are introduced throughout the course of the movie . Best of all almost none of the characters have anything to do with the story . They're either killed by Jack or they serve no purpose whatsoever . Jack himself was pretty sweet . Like most other monsters Jack has the amazing ability to seemingly teleport over great distances . He's invariably hanging somewhere in the background whenever you're dealing with a major character . What's puzzling however is that when he's actually chasing someone he moves at a shambling speed and yet he's able to keep up with people who are sprinting . That's all for now . Closing remarks if you're looking for a unintentionally hilarious bad movie you ca n't go wrong by renting this beast . Bad Movie Score Good Movie Score,1,0,0.9292684654270928,0.0707315345729071

The grotesque visions hallucinations dreams continue begin to affect his mental state Fulci decides to seek help contacts Professor Egon Schwarz Thompson for psychiatric help . Schwarz claims that Fulci can not separate fantasy from reality agrees to help him however Schwarz has a more sinister ulterior motive as a serial killer starts to brutally kill prostitutes Fulci thinks he might be responsible . This Italian production was co directed by Lucio Fulci who also stars in the film as a horror film director named Lucio Fulci which does n't really feel like a lot of effort went into it anyway Un Gatto nel Cervello is gory if nothing else for that alone rather liked it . The script by Fulci John Fitzsimmons Giovanni Simonelli Antonio Tentori is nothing more than a threadbare excuse to edit together lots of gory footage from other Italian films . It serves it's purpose well enough suppose to see Fulci on screen has a certain fascination if your a fan of his or are familiar with his films the ending is very rushed almost as if they ran out of money as it just has a policeman telling Fulci they killed the killer that's it . Another thing about that ending when the two cops put the white sheet over the dead killer in the field then they walk away leaving it there without any other police presence mean would the police in Italy just leave a dead body in the middle of a field on it's own ? It moves along at a good pace if you like your gore then you have to see this although if you do n't like gore then you'll hate it with a passion it all depends on your disposition so the choice folks is yours . Director Fulci was never the most artistically adept filmmaker it shows here as his footage is bland flat looks like it was shot for TV the footage from the other films in total does n't match the stuff Fulci shot it is obvious that this has been pieced together from different films . If your looking for gore you've hit the jackpot people are dismembered with chainsaws put through meat grinders faces are melted there are a few decapitations there are some slit throats someones body is gorily crushed under a car a tongue is ripped out someone has their throat crushed as a wheelchair runs over it there are loads of stabbings someone has their guts removed with a hook there's a rotten corpse complete with maggots someone hand is cut off someone has their head bashed in their eye falls out a gory death by piano wire as it slices through someones throat there are loads of severed limbs gallons of blood splashed around a scene of some cats eating brains there's more as well . Having said that some of the special effects are a bit fake look cheesy . With a supposed budget of around it shows this is pretty cheap looking it has no visual style or artistic merit but then again why would you want those when you can see a Nazi orgy sequence wall gore ? The acting in this is terrible including Fulci . Un Gatto nel Cervello is a top film if your a gore like me however if your looking for something with a little bit more substance or indeed any substance then this ones not for you . This is the sort of film which divides people straight down the middle you'll either love what it does or hate it .,1,0,0.9269051414873384,0.0730948585126616

The first few minutes of the movie had me worried it starts with one of Micks tired get angry at insignificant things'' routines but that was given a neat touch which at least made it a little refreshing . The rest of the script was pretty good and very light hearted even the typical Mick Molloy Judith Lucy humour was delivered well and whilst never had to pick myself up from the aisles it generated a lot more chuckles that was expecting it was consistant There's nothing new in the plot pretty predictable but it moved along quickly between one and other jokes never felt it harboured on any element too long or too short Mick must have worked hard on polishing his script . There were a one or two Late Show'' in and one or two jokes that only Melbournians would get but certainly there's plenty of generic stuff in there for a wider audience . Something that found disappointing was the relative unfunnyness of John Clarke he just did n't seem to work as the bad guy but that does n't detract from the movie too much .

Why does he just run away from his job is that freedom'' And in the end is the new Europe supposed to rest on bunch of people who smoke up and shag all day ? Is this what it's made up of ? Besides the acting was pretty horrible . ca n't believe Judith Godr role and acting . Why was she made to look like Emanuelle so much ?

When the corpse hits the ground it bounces like a wobbly rubber scene where Jack sniffs the ground getting a vision was so lame it got me laughing hysterically . Lame music cheesy scenes bad acting and plain dumb filming techniques are obviously the functions that make this movie such a malfunction . To state that this is a good movie would be the same as stating that nuclear bombs are good for humans . Clearly those of you who say that this is one of the best action have n't seen many in your life . This is basically a vampire that deserves but which I'll give just for its ability the lousiest action have ever seen making me laugh and because just ca n't live without it .,1,0,0.9584560156071624,0.0415439843928376

What is n't made so clear is that most immigrant groups had their own Mafia's but most of them made their money and went legit . And why not ? Who wants to die in jail ? Joseph Bonanno was a ruthless man prepared to kill if needs be but not an unfair or stupid one .

This movies Strongest point is that it had a Briliant Storyline and one of the best Western plots ever and for a while its fun to watch as John Reid is nursed back to health he and his fellow Rangers are ambushed . fun to see him grow into his new life and Identity as the Lone Ranger he concels his identity and goes on a revenge run to get the gang responsible for killing his brother and all his fellow rangers to whom he rode with . But unfortunatly good as the storyline is its all ruined by Merle Haggard Narrating everything as you are watching it happen the love of God why did they do that ? between Merle Haggard's Narration and The Statler Brothers singing corny songs like Ride little cowboy'' being playing in the backgound make this movie impossible to take serious . would Love to see a really good producer take this same script and story and re this film right at the heart of this silly film is a great western . would descibe this film as a beautiful woman dress in the ugliest clothing . give it stars out of your years old and dont know better then you might love it .,0,1,0.0852425167359917,0.9147574832640084

The ending was a bit sudden with no conclusion given to characters and events once the finale came to its gripping end but perhaps that's what the filmmakers were going for ?

For one thing it was filmed on location in Colorado it Breckinridge or Telluride ? ca n't remember but it is in the credits The location is absolutely stunning and spectacular . It's beautiful even to me who lived in Colorado for several years . Next it has Disney's penchant for wonderful character actors . Harry Morgan has never been in better form than when he plays in a Disney movie . He is literally hysterical . Also remember the wonderful Mary Wickes ? Although she has a bit part'' in this movie she is great as always . If you do n't know who she is think of the animated Disney version of Hunchback from Notre Dame was one of the gargoyles and she was also the most interesting nun in Sister Act'' as well as the best nun in The Trouble With Angels . She has always been a great character actress and most character actors never receive the recognition they deserve . In addition to character actors and all casts in the Disney may have not had the greatest'' movies but if you really watch some of them from beginning to end you will NOTICE that every movie has some really funny or hysterical moment in it . The entire movie may not be funny but there is always a comic gem least or in every single live movie Disney ever made . Whether it's Harry Morgan in one of his bellowing tones of voice or Tim Conway floundering around or Joe Flynn giving one of his priceless looks of horror it is all good . The whole film may not be good but there are ALWAYS hysterical moments in every Disney film from this period that have ever seen . Disney in this time period always managed to make a person smile despite the dumbness of the film . Bsed on these comments disagree with viewers who say every Disney movie in this time period is awful . That statement it not quite accurate . Rather it is easier for me to give credit to the funny moments and overlook the weaknesses in the plots . Some live Disney movies are true classics Yeller Bedknobs and Broomsticks Mary Poppins but for those that are n't am able to appreciate them for what they were good clean family fun in a time when movies had become vulgar crude and offensive .,0,1,0.0316697163620783,0.9683302836379216

11165_4.txt, have recently found this film on one of my husband's vhs tapes blank variety which he uses to record stuff from the telly the film looks as if it was last shown in the eighties and do n't remember having seen it since . it has not my knowledge been released on dvd or vhs although shall browse around for a copy . the film tells the story of three young people two girls one on the edge of puberty and the other much younger and a young boy who go to live with their mother's brother and his young mute irish wife . his wife also has two brothers who live with them . the children's uncle is an unpleasant control freak who forces his young wife to wear a silver collar whilst she watches a marionette show put on by him and her brothers in his toyshop . the eldest girl and one of the irishmen younger develop a love for each other whilst they live in the same house . the girl helps her aunt out in the shop whilst her brother helps his uncle to make things in the workshop . there are a lot of very disturbing elements to the film . there is the uncle's treatment of his wife as some kind of dumb possession by the collar whilst the irish indulge dancing drinking and somewhat forbidden love . interestingly though have seen far more explicit themes played out in other movies made in hollywood today . makes you wonder whether the british film industry and the bbc have some kind of hidden agenda going on . still despite it not being a children's movie there are a lot of playful magic moments in it and the one irishman does some beautiful paintings ., have recently found this film on one of my husband's VHS tapes blank variety which he uses to record stuff from the telly The film looks as if it was last shown in the eighties and do n't remember having seen it since . It has not my knowledge been released on DVD or VHS although shall browse around for a copy . The film tells the story of three young people two girls one on the edge of puberty and the other much younger and a young boy who go to live with their mother's brother and his young mute Irish wife . His wife also has two brothers who live with them . The children's uncle is an unpleasant control freak who forces his young wife to wear a silver collar whilst she watches a marionette show put on by him and her brothers in his toyshop . The eldest girl and one of the Irishmen younger develop a love for each other whilst they live in the same house . The girl helps her aunt out in the shop whilst her brother helps his uncle to make things in the workshop . There are a lot of very disturbing elements to the film . There is the uncle's treatment of his wife as some kind of dumb possession by the collar whilst the Irish indulge dancing drinking and somewhat forbidden love . Interestingly though have seen far more explicit themes played out in other movies made in Hollywood today . Makes you wonder whether the British film industry and the BBC have some kind of hidden agenda going on .
