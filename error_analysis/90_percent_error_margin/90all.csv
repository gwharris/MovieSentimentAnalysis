6133_8.txt, stumbled upon this movie by chance . was traveling a few years back and this movie was on some channel on cable at the hotel late one night . Not much else on and figured watch it for about to minutes until decided to go to bed . Needless to say stayed up and watched the complete movie . The plot was very interesting and does make you wonder if there had not been SS who did this or at least thought of doing it . have been looking all over for this movie . even sent and email to the production company but the were n't sure that it would ever make it to DVD but said there was always hope . If anyone finds this movie drop a note here where you found it as I'd sure like to get a copy some day ., stumbled upon this movie by chance . was traveling a few years back and this movie was on some channel on cable at the hotel late one night .

1373_10.txt, People seem to be expecting Citizen Kane here ! The Planet is a movie and as such is good fun and different enough to be enjoyed . The director clearly has something to offer not so sure about some of the cast . As for the effects ? ai n't a lot of effects budget . for one would happily recommend this outing to a sci head or anyone who does n't take monster movies too seriously . If so ? Watch blue instead . noticed one review saying it had ripped off Alien . Like Alien did n't rip things off . The best thing about the film ? The director . The worst thing about the film ? The cast .

2673_9.txt, When the movie first started thought cheesy . The first ten minutes were really boring . After the slow beginning and some of the soap opera antics started liking it . The plot was different than anything had ever seen . Now was it a horror ? Not really . It should n't have been classied as a horror or the producers should have put more money into the movie to make it scary . As it was the creatures where only there for a short time . can only assume this was for money reason . The good side was that the movie was very entertaining . It held my interest the start and did make me wonder about creatures from another dimension . It was obvious that this was a first time movie for the director but there were a couple of highlights . By the end was hooked . Too bad Hollywood did n't put more money behind this ., When the movie first started thought cheesy . The first ten minutes were really boring .

6202_7.txt, enjoyed this series but felt that the whole thing was let down by the sound recording For whatever reason they've had to employ an awful lot of what's called ADR where the actors replace the original location sound with a re of it in a sound booth . The reasons for doing this are usually due to problems at the location or because somebody screwed up somewhere in the sound production chain . It would n't be so bad if the ADR was done well but at times it's just plain distracting . It's not just the ADR that's the problem the sound mix just does n't match up to the quality of performances and the pictures . I'd be curious to know what went wrong ., enjoyed this series but felt that the whole thing was let down by the sound recording For whatever reason they've had to employ an awful lot of what's called ADR where the actors replace the original location sound with a re of it in a sound booth .

8134_7.txt, This was Laurel and Hardy's last silent film for Roach Studios . However since the public had a real thirst for talkies'' this same short was re by the team just a few years later with only a few small plot changes . LAUGHING GRAVY was essentially the same plot except that Stan and Ollie were trying to hide a cute puppy from their grouchy landlord a goat like in ANGORA LOVE . This whole goat angle is the worst part of the film . While you could understand the boys wanting to keep a cute little dog all it is snowy outside why exactly they bring a goat home is just contrived and pointless . According to the plot the goat followed them home and so they got tired of shooing it away and kept it . Huh ? This just does n't make any sense it had been a giraffe or a cow would they have done the same thing ? Apart from being an unconvincing plot the movie itself is pure Laurel and Hardy with a familiar plot and familiar roles for the comedians . This film features quite a few laughs but unfortunately is n't one of their better films to wrap up their silent careers . This aspect of their careers just seems to have ended with a whimper ., This was Laurel and Hardy's last silent film for Roach Studios .

6510_7.txt, Okay think we're all agreed that Michael Jackson was the low point . And the special effects too . But please keep in mind that this was NOT a big film okay ? Not every film gets as much of a budget as Harry Potter or Star Wars . However thought it was pretty funny altogether . Nothing that would in my opinion waste your time . Parodies are always fun to watch and just because it was n't big budget does n't mean it's bad . think this was a good movie if weak at some points .

4990_7.txt, Comanche Moon'' had everything going for it . For starters Simon Wincer's back a man who's name is synonymous with high TV westerns . Unfortunately the problems with Moon'' are something even the most talented director could n't solve poor script based on a lackluster novel . Forget historical accuracies as any reader of the novels can tell you the biggest travesty in Moon'' is that it's not even consistent with information from the original Lonesome Dove'' masterpiece . So many wonderful rich moments in the miniseries and to an even greater degree the book are completely missing in Moon . Considering the fact that most viewers of Moon'' are probably coming with at least some sort of Dove'' background the lack of character and emotional backstory is downright painful . That said Moon'' is one instance where the adapted version could and should have been altered to make it more suitable for the screen . For example the novel Moon'' focuses largely on the Comanches themselves . To its credit the miniseries tries to service the Comanches but in the end it gives them just enough that the viewer just gets a sense they're missing out on some important part of the story . Similarly Val Kilmer's Scull loses out here too the role should have either been expanded so Kilmer Rachel Griffiths for that matter actually had something to do or the roles should have just been reduced to smaller supporting parts . Instead Kilmer gets top billing for a character that just leaves you scratching your head after his appearance in the completely bizarre final act . There's strange moments throughout the film that just make no sense to those who have n't read the book killer parrot ? what ? further there is n't a single scene that shows us that Call and McCrae are anything near the amazing Texas rangers they claim to be . Not a single one of their expeditions in Moon Dead Man's Walk for that matter ends successfully and Call and McCrae just seem to blunder their way through one pointless mission after another . Frankly Larry McMurtry should never have been given the job of writing the script and only did so because of the praise surrounding that other cowboy movie Brokeback Mountain . McMurtry can write good novels there's some dissension over the consistency of that statement but he's never exactly established himself as a scriptwriter . This production would have benefited from not only bringing back director Wincer but original screenwriter Bill Wittcliff to adapt the novel to screen . Witcliff does n't exactly have a mountainload of material to his screen writing credit but no one can deny he did a fantastic job at whittling down the original Lonesome Dove . With all this said Comanche Moon'' is almost a brilliant production aided by a terrific cast that unfortunately just are n't given enough to do . Steve Zahn's portrayal of Gus McCrae or rather his portrayal of Robert Duvall as Gus McCrae is dead And while some have criticized Karl Urban as Woodrow Call saying his performance does n't imitate the quiet stoic Woodrow of the original movie all can say is blame McMurtry because McMurtry is the one who both in the Moon'' novel and now the miniseries turned Woodrow from socially inept awkward but natural leader into some emotionless character whose lines are just dull and whose character motivations are only clear if you've seen them portrayed far more adequately in the sequel'' Still it's the cast that sparkles in Moon to the degree that left the miniseries with that same feeling of melancholy felt watching the original Lonesome Dove'' this time because realized it's probably the last time we'll see these characters appear on screen for a long long time to come and quite honestly this cast could have done so well in a well full network TV series . All in all aside from wasted opportunities with the cast the biggest travesty is that the original Lonesome Dove novel contained so much rich backstory for the characters that would have been fascinating utterly fascinating to see translated on screen . Unfortunately all that has been tossed aside in favor of McMurtry's tedious inconsistent and ultimately irrelevant prequel ., Comanche Moon'' had everything going for it .

Especially at the start he continually quotes Shakespeare and acts like a pompous actor . One could say he was playing the part properly but the character seemed to me flat and unfunny . Overall would say see only if a fan of the actors involved . Otherwise wait for video or tv .,1,0,0.9237349369786916,0.0762650630213084

7116_7.txt, House of Dracula works from the same basic premise as House of Frankenstein from the year before namely that Universal's three most famous monsters Dracula Frankenstein's Monster and The Wolf Man are appearing in the movie together . Naturally the film is rather messy therefore but the fact that all three monsters are there is usually enough to ensure that the film's sixty seven minutes do n't become boring . It's obvious that the idea of making another monster mash came into the writer's head before an actual plot did as the yarn we're given is n't exactly without holes . The plot sees Count Dracula arrive at Dr. Edelman's home asking for a cure for his vampirism . Then what can only be described as a coincidence sees Lawrence Talbot The Wolf Man turn up asking for a cure for his affliction ! It turns out that Dracula is on the prowl for Edelman's daughter but Talbot really is serious . When it turns out that he ca n't be stopped from turning into a wolf The Wolf Man throws himself into the sea . he ends up finding Frankenstein's Monster . Overall this film is n't as good as the earlier House of Frankenstein . The film put its plot together better than this entry in the series does as the plot here does n't give equal time to each Universal monster . Dracula's plot is the biggest at first but soon fizzles out only to resurface at the end . The Wolf Man is the star of the show but his story never really develops and is essentially just another version of the plot he always finds himself in . Frankenstein's Monster is given the coldest hand as he appears in the movie merely as an afterthought and an obvious excuse to ensure that all three monsters appear in the movie . The story of the doctor who binds all three together is the most interesting but this is a little disappointing as he is n't the reason why people will see this film . The acting is good enough with John Carradine showing his sinister side and Lon Chaney Jr once again making sure that his character is bathed in tragedy . Glenn Strange is given nothing to do and Onslow Stevens proves the real highlight as Dr Edelman . Overall this film wo n't do much for anyone that is n't a fan of Universal horror but as silly monster movies go House of Dracula is worth seeing ., House of Dracula works from the same basic premise as House of Frankenstein from the year before namely that Universal's three most famous monsters Dracula Frankenstein's Monster and The Wolf Man are appearing in the movie together .

It had all sorts of differences that it tried to tie together a bad thing in itself but the result is at best awkward but in fact ridiculous many clashes that would n't really happen . Then the end of the movie last minutes all the rest . Why does n't Xavier talk to the Erasmus students he meets back in Paris ? Why does he just walk off ? Why does he just run away from his job is that freedom'' And in the end is the new Europe supposed to rest on bunch of people who smoke up and shag all day ? Is this what it's made up of ?

Like another reviewer said it does n't take itself seriously . There's no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so . The soundtrack is so funny laugh every time hear it . The is just a laugh riot . It's an all out war zone in New York full of explosions and total chaos . ridiculous you ca n't help but chuckle at the sight of it . Other hilarious moments The scene with Kersey and the cop running side by side like cowboys against the whole Wild West was so cheesy it was funny . killed me how the bad guys could be shooting at Kersey and he could even drop down on one knee taking ever slow aim and not get hit LMAO . Of course with him it was one shot kill with his elephant handgun LOL . Another hilarious scene was the end when he finally killed the leader of the gang . a ROCKET LAUNCHER lol . the whole side of the apartment building with it . It's apparent that Kersey is all but used to losing loved ones . his new girlfriend is quickly disposed of after only a few dates . The acting is so bad that you ca n't blame anyone that could only think that Kersey is mad at the destruction of the car lol . runs down looks at the carnage and just walks away .

2158_10.txt, Yes indeed we have a winner a winner in best dumb The only reason chose to vote a for this movie is because it's so incredibly bad that it actually becomes funny . Night Hunter'' is basically about Jack Cutter a Vampire hunter hunters have been in his generation for centuries apparently and his mission being that he has to kill the last remaining Vampires . This movie contains one of the cheesiest scenes have ever seen in my life . Not to mention the really bad gun scenes . When people are shot in this movie blood splatters thick as ketchup all over the place this makes the movie seem so cheap and lame that you just lose interest . constant shaking of the camera is what annoys me the most during the fight This is suppose done to create an action though in my opinion it gives no effect whatsoever . Its completely ridiculous ! All stunt are done extremely badly . a scene where the dead Vampire gets thrown off a roof . When the corpse hits the ground it bounces like a wobbly rubber scene where Jack sniffs the ground getting a vision was so lame it got me laughing hysterically . Lame music cheesy scenes bad acting and plain dumb filming techniques are obviously the functions that make this movie such a malfunction . To state that this is a good movie would be the same as stating that nuclear bombs are good for humans . Clearly those of you who say that this is one of the best action have n't seen many in your life .

11478_3.txt, saw this movie when it first came to the theaters in and though knew it was n't of award winning caliber . kinda liked it . It tales the tale of former cub scouts reuniting to take on the one task they never got to finish as kids which is to climb Mt . Whitehead . Of course now the cub scouts are all grown up and have developed their personalities in a variety of ways but none too differently than they were as children . Richard Lewis is still neurotic Richard Belzer is still a playboy Franklyn Ajaye is still sort of the Dear Abby of the group and Tim Thomerson is still the surfer dude of the group . Of course the top billed star is Louie Anderson a true believer'' in everything Cub Scout related . He still lives in the same house with his mother still goes over the Cub Scout manual daily is brave reverent and clean and is the one who reunites the others for one more grand adventure in Scouting . Compounding their task however is the Grunski brothers two bullies drummed out of the Cub Scouts by the above mentioned . By coincidence they run into their old den and decide to harass them a bit albeit harmlessly . Not so harmlessly is three escaped convicts who think Pack is from the FBI and are intent on wiping them out . All in all the movie still has bits of charm . Observe Richard Lewis trying to get comfortable on a folding cot for example and you have a really funny bit going for you . Upon further review the entire film needed more of that type of observational humor . It does n't hold up well after all these years but still remains a guilty pleasure ., saw this movie when it first came to the theaters in and though knew it was n't of award winning caliber . kinda liked it .

This is more of a love story between Helen and Paris who is shipwrecked and falls in love with Helen without knowing she is queen . The film portrays the couple as lovesick and wanting nothing more than to be together . films and books have different portrayals of the characters but in this one they are simply hopelessly in love . The film is pretty slow in some places but the battles and the detail to the scenery are done pretty well . There are also some good performances . thought that the slave girl did a particularly good job and she was one of the most well characters . Overall this is a good adaption if you can look beyond the slow story in places and look beyond some of the cheesy romance and dialogue .

3794_4.txt, went to see this nights ago here in Cork Ireland . It was the world premiere of it in the tiny cinema in the Triskel Arts Centre as part of the Cork Film Festival . found Strange Fruit'' to be an excellent movie . It is a bit rough around the edges but for a low movie that is to be expected ! In general the acting from the main lead Kent Faulcon is wonderful the cinematography and direction excellent and the script hugely entertaining and thought with some nice set and witty dialogue . The ending was a bit sudden with no conclusion given to characters and events once the finale came to its gripping end but perhaps that's what the filmmakers were going for ? It certainly did make the movie more unsettling . did like the fact that the main character never came to terms with his mother on screen it leaves you wondering whether or not he ever will as in real sometimes these things are never settled . This was a good choice to leave it unresolved rather than sentimentally wrapping it up ! Taut and suspenseful throughout Strange Fruit'' is a hugely ambitious debut and have high hopes for what the writer Kyle Schickner will unleash next . He and his colleagues are a talent worth watching . hope Strange Fruit'' gets a wider release soon as more people deserve to see this movie an above thriller with some original and insightful twists on homophobia and racism in America's Deep South .

9940_1.txt, Heftig og Begeistret and Enthusiastic is a documentary story of a male choir up in Berlev in the very northern part of Norway where the weather is cold and hostile the days are dark during the winter and the towns are faced with young people moving to the more populated parts in the south of Norway where the climate is warmer and there are more opportunities . The most beautiful part of this movie is the humans themselves . The people in the choir who are aged from to all have unique colorful lives and are very enjoyable beings . They are characterised by the harsh climate and the recession of the North and have adapted to the way of living required . Throughout the movie we learn a bit about many people in the choir and we follow them through songs some events in a church and on the harbour and in the end a trip to Murmansk . The outside environment filmed in the movie is very beautiful and characterised by the Norwegian nature .

Is it because of the nature ? Or is it simply just to see a story about Berlev Mens about their life and some of the trips they have . The message if there is any is that this small society copes with life through such social events like the choir . The choir have kept the people together for many many years . It is all nice but being as popular as it has been seen by almost in Norway there is something wrong . There is no beginning or end to it . Nobody gains or loses anything nobody reveals any message or tries to convince the audience of that this is good or that life up there is great . Why was this movie made ? am sorry . It is a nice movie about good people but compared to the average European Scandinavian or Norwegian movie this does not deserve a out of It is closer to out of and that is what will give it . If you see this movie in a theater you should expect the average age on the audience to be around It has reported to be consistently high in all theaters .

6170_4.txt, Mickey Rourke hunts Diane Lane in Elmore Leonard's Killshot It is not like Mickey Rourke ever really disappeared . He has had a steady string of appearances before he burst back on the scene . He was memorable in Domino Sin City Man on Fire Once Upon a Time in Mexico and Get Carter . But in his powerful dramatic performance in The Wrestler we see a full blown presentation of the character only hinted at in Get Carter . Whenever we get to know him Rourke remains a cool but sleazy muscle bound slim ball . This is an Elmore Leonard story and production . Leonard wrote such notable movies as taunt western thriller to Yuma Be Cool Jackie Brown Get Shorty Pick and Joe Kidd . This means that we get tough guys some good some not so good . It also means we get tight realistic plots with characters doing what is best for them in each situation weaving complications into violent conclusions . Killshot is no different . Tough slim ball killer Rourke stalks unhappily married witness Lane . Think History of Violence meets No Country for Old Men . It is not as intense bloody or gory as those two but it is almost as good . If you like those two including David Croneberg's equally wonderful Eastern Promises you will like Killshot also . Director John Madden has not done a lot of movies . His last few were enjoyable if not successful Proof Captain Corelli's Mandolin and Shakespeare in Love . Diana Lane has n't had a powerful movie role since she and Richard Gere gave incredible performances in Unfaithful . Lately she is charming and appealing in romantic stories such as Nights in Rodanthe Must Love Dogs and Under the Tuscan Sun . Here she is right on mark balancing her sexy appeal with reserved tension . This is a small part for Rosario Dawson . Yet Dawson does a good job with it . You see a lot more of Lane including an underwear scene to rival Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut . While you are in the crime drama section also pick up Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Gone Baby Gone and Before the Devil Knows Your Dead . The last has wonderful performances by Phillip Seymour Hoffman Ethan Hawke Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney . Killshot flopped at the box office . More is our luck . It is certainly worth a dollar rental if you like this genre ., Mickey Rourke hunts Diane Lane in Elmore Leonard's Killshot It is not like Mickey Rourke ever really disappeared . He has had a steady string of appearances before he burst back on the scene . He was memorable in Domino Sin City Man on Fire Once Upon a Time in Mexico and Get Carter . But in his powerful dramatic performance in The Wrestler we see a full blown presentation of the character only hinted at in Get Carter . Whenever we get to know him Rourke remains a cool but sleazy muscle bound slim ball . This is an Elmore Leonard story and production . Leonard wrote such notable movies as taunt western thriller to Yuma Be Cool Jackie Brown Get Shorty Pick and Joe Kidd . This means that we get tough guys some good some not so good . It also means we get tight realistic plots with characters doing what is best for them in each situation weaving complications into violent conclusions . Killshot is no different .

9528_1.txt, Lois Weber's film Hypocrites'' was and still kind of is a very bold and daring film . enjoyed it and was very impressed by the filming and story of it . The priest sees the hypocrisy of the people in his church and tries to show them the naked'' truth . The people are appalled when he reveals the naked statue portraying truth after failing to lead them to it and the few that did help along the way . The people do not want to face the truth that they are doing anything wrong but it shows them putting things before God going to beach parties acting inappropriate their materialistic ways and other things in which the people of our world do that tend to not be morally right . In the end failing to gain any followers he must enter into the gates of heaven alone . This film seems to me to be very bold in the fact that a naked woman is shown throughout it especially considering the time period in which this film was made . The imagery and symbolism portrayed in this movie found incredible . The way they made the naked woman translucent and using a naked woman to symbolize the naked truth shows a lot of creativity and art . Showing the different sins of the people as they walked down the road and refused to follow along the path each with different excuses setbacks and higher priorities was a great way of representing the people of today . This film does a very good job of getting the moral message across to its audience . Lois Weber has a tremendous way of capturing her spectators attention with her creativity symbolism visuals and through auditory . Even the music of the piano throughout this film is very beautiful and fitting with the whole theme ., Lois Weber's film Hypocrites'' was and still kind of is a very bold and daring film . enjoyed it and was very impressed by the filming and story of it .

11653_3.txt, Based on the comments made so far everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it . think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a GREAT movie it has its interesting moments . For one thing it was filmed on location in Colorado it Breckinridge or Telluride ? ca n't remember but it is in the credits The location is absolutely stunning and spectacular . It's beautiful even to me who lived in Colorado for several years . Next it has Disney's penchant for wonderful character actors . Harry Morgan has never been in better form than when he plays in a Disney movie . He is literally hysterical . Also remember the wonderful Mary Wickes ? Although she has a bit part'' in this movie she is great as always . If you do n't know who she is think of the animated Disney version of Hunchback from Notre Dame was one of the gargoyles and she was also the most interesting nun in Sister Act'' as well as the best nun in The Trouble With Angels . She has always been a great character actress and most character actors never receive the recognition they deserve . In addition to character actors and all casts in the Disney may have not had the greatest'' movies but if you really watch some of them from beginning to end you will NOTICE that every movie has some really funny or hysterical moment in it . The entire movie may not be funny but there is always a comic gem least or in every single live movie Disney ever made . Whether it's Harry Morgan in one of his bellowing tones of voice or Tim Conway floundering around or Joe Flynn giving one of his priceless looks of horror it is all good . The whole film may not be good but there are ALWAYS hysterical moments in every Disney film from this period that have ever seen . Disney in this time period always managed to make a person smile despite the dumbness of the film . Bsed on these comments disagree with viewers who say every Disney movie in this time period is awful . That statement it not quite accurate . Rather it is easier for me to give credit to the funny moments and overlook the weaknesses in the plots . Some live Disney movies are true classics Yeller Bedknobs and Broomsticks Mary Poppins but for those that are n't am able to appreciate them for what they were good clean family fun in a time when movies had become vulgar crude and offensive ., Based on the comments made so far everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it . think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a GREAT movie it has its interesting moments .

4383_4.txt, When was young was a big fan of Chuck Norris . just begun getting out all his old movies on video so can see them through adult eyes . remember that really liked this one in particular and thought it was one of his best . Now that I'm a little older can say that although it's thoroughly average still consider it one of his better films . In an acting stretch for him Norris plays a cop haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie . Serial Killers are all the rage nowadays and people would like to think of them as a wholly invention . In contrast it's good to see where the current infatuation has sprung from most obviously action movies well as stalk slashers of and While Norris attempts at both humour and any form of human compassion are ham and laughable nobody could kick someone in the head quite like Chuck . Being a big fan of Steve James also can recommend this film ditto for genre legend Billy Drago as well as seeing Mitch from The Blue Brothers in a supporting role . Not great but it's better than anything Norris did in the, When was young was a big fan of Chuck Norris . just begun getting out all his old movies on video so can see them through adult eyes . remember that really liked this one in particular and thought it was one of his best .

11165_4.txt, have recently found this film on one of my husband's VHS tapes blank variety which he uses to record stuff from the telly The film looks as if it was last shown in the eighties and do n't remember having seen it since . It has not my knowledge been released on DVD or VHS although shall browse around for a copy . The film tells the story of three young people two girls one on the edge of puberty and the other much younger and a young boy who go to live with their mother's brother and his young mute Irish wife . His wife also has two brothers who live with them . The children's uncle is an unpleasant control freak who forces his young wife to wear a silver collar whilst she watches a marionette show put on by him and her brothers in his toyshop . The eldest girl and one of the Irishmen younger develop a love for each other whilst they live in the same house . The girl helps her aunt out in the shop whilst her brother helps his uncle to make things in the workshop . There are a lot of very disturbing elements to the film . There is the uncle's treatment of his wife as some kind of dumb possession by the collar whilst the Irish indulge dancing drinking and somewhat forbidden love . Interestingly though have seen far more explicit themes played out in other movies made in Hollywood today . Makes you wonder whether the British film industry and the BBC have some kind of hidden agenda going on . Still despite it not being a children's movie there are a lot of playful magic moments in it and the one Irishman does some beautiful paintings ., have recently found this film on one of my husband's VHS tapes blank variety which he uses to record stuff from the telly The film looks as if it was last shown in the eighties and do n't remember having seen it since .

11945_4.txt, am a longtime fan of the original of this movie Martha Martha and everything that makes that movie great and enjoyable to watch is missing from this one . miss the slow pace the build of characters and their style in small gestures the dominance of lights and moods and moves over dialog . do n't think that the story itself is enough . Martha is more secluded and Mario is not a clown . In most of the cases the things that makes one scene great in the original its is not working in its copy here . The small alterations take away the tension . My opinion is that you should go and see the original . It'll worth the inconvenience of subtitles ., am a longtime fan of the original of this movie Martha Martha and everything that makes that movie great and enjoyable to watch is missing from this one . miss the slow pace the build of characters and their style in small gestures the dominance of lights and moods and moves over dialog . do n't think that the story itself is enough .
